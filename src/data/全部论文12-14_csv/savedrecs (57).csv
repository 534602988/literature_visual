A theoretical model for explaining the formation of legitimacy in a certain political sector was developed and empirically tested in the context of Finnish forest policy. Nationwide mail survey data was used to determine the differences in the perceptions of forest policy by Finnish forest owners and other citizens. The questionnaire measured the legitimacy of the forest policy, the acceptance of laws, the justice of the procedures, the fairness of power relations, the acceptance of forestry operations and the competence in forest policy issues. Overall legitimacy was evaluated positively, and the forest owners considered forest policy in general to be more acceptable than other citizens did. The most criticized aspects of forest policy were the justice of the procedures and the use of clearcutting. Procedural justice and acceptance of forestry operations were the strongest explanatory factors for the legitimacy. Acceptance of the power relations of different stakeholder groups explained legitimacy for non-owners but not for forest owners. In both groups, forest policy competence led to a more negative evaluation of legitimacy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this, there is not much evidence on the determinants of these behaviours. This is the first paper to explore the determinants of study behaviours across multiple subject areas; and is the first to incorporate students' noncognitive traits into such a model; that the authors are aware of. This enables the formation of policy that can improve academic achievement by encouraging study behaviour. The results show that students' noncognitive traits, in particular conscientiousness and future-orientation, are important determinants of lecture attendance and additional study hours. In fact, there is very little that explains undergraduate study behaviour besides noncognitive traits. Standard economic factors, such as family income, financial aid and parental transfers, are not predictive of study behaviours. Some comments are provided on a potential behavioural economics approach to encouraging study behaviours. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The samples were collected during vegetation seasons 2011 and 2012 from growth stage milk ripe (BBCH 73) to harvest (BBCH 99) at two localities (Hronovce and Sklabina). The average infestation by Fusarium spp. in barley grain was low, ranging from 2.14 - 3.57 %. Totally, seven Fusarium species were identified in grains: F. poae, F. equiseti, F. graminearum, F. langsethiae, F. sporotrichoides, F. avenaceum, F. tricinctum. In both localities, the most predominant species each year was F. poae with frequency of occurrence ranging from 1 to 4 % with high relative density 40 - 100 %. Generally, Fusarium graminearum had frequency of occurrence 1-3 % with low relative density - 16.67 %. Fusarium equiseti and Fusarium avenaceum achieved frequency of occurrence - 3 %. The less frequent species - F. tricinctum, F. sporotrichioides, F. langsethiae achieved low relative density in population structure.

The following substances were observed: growth factor IGF-I, steroid hormones progesterone and estradiol, regulators of apoptosis: Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3. Growth factor IGF-I and steroid hormones progesterone and estradiol were detected by RIA method and intracellular peptides were detected by Western-imunoblotting. In our study all examined substances were affected by various concentrations of [(NH4)(6)center dot Mo7O24 center dot 4H(2)O]. The release of growth factor IGF-I was inhibited by all concentrations of selected Mo. The highest dose of Mo (500 mu g.ml(-1)) stimulated the most intense IGF-I secretion. In the case of the steroid hormone progesterone we did not achieve demonstrable (p >= 0,05) results, but the secretion of P-4 had a decreasing tendency. The inhibitory effect of estradiol on the release of Mo was seen (p <= 0,05) at concentrations of 90 mu g.ml(-1), 170 mu g.ml(-1), 500 mu g.ml(-1), at a dose of 330 mu g.ml(-1) results were not conclusive, but nevertheless, we detected a reduction in estradiol secretion. Inhibition of apoptosis marker expression of Bcl-2 has been observed due to the lowest concentrations (90 and 170 mu g.ml(-1)), increasing expression was observed in the experiment with the addition of 330 mu g.ml(-1). At concentrations of 90, 170, 330 mu g.ml(-1) was found to stimulate the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax peptide. Lower doses of Mo (90 and 170 mu g.ml(-1)) had no effect on the expression of caspase-3, release was not significantly (p <= 0,05) stimulated concentrations of 330 and 500 mu g.ml(-1). Data obtained from in vitro experiment indicate that Mo has an effect on endocrine and apoptotic processes in the ovaries of rats. The results of this work suggest that the effect of Mo on ovarian processes is dose-dependent. Compounds of this metal may be potential regulators of intracellular ovary processes, hormone secretion and expression of regulators of apoptosis.","[Detvanova, L.; Kalhotka, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kolesarova, A.] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Mendel University in Brno; Slovak Agricultural Research Center; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Detvanová, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",lenka.detvanova@gmail.com,"Kolesarova, Adriana/I-7526-2019; Kalhotka, Libor/I-8496-2018","Kolesarova, Adriana/0000-0002-1272-9099;",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,701,705,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800122,0

These soils are among the most fertile soils in Czech Republic, which are intensively farmed. Farmers have been troubled for some time by the water erosion and soil degradation, which often affects these soils due to agricultural intensification, use of unsuitable farming practices and cultivation of wide-row crops even in areas where the risk of erosion is high. One can often encounter soil compaction and water erosion on chernozems, which even reveal loess in some places. Most agrotechnical methods for soil characteristics improvement aim at topsoil, i.e. to the depth of 30 cm. Some authors found out, though, that the compaction after traverson of heavy machines can occure as deep as 77 cm below the surface. So the problem is not only the loss of material itself, but also the change of soil characteristics, which further contributes to the increase in erosive processes and reduce the soil fertility. Three soil horizons were described on five different plots - at the top of the slope, in its centre, and at the foot of the slope and the physical properties of the soil were examined. Large amount of avulsion and accumulation of the soil material under the slope were noticed on the selected plots. The soil compaction in the topsoil usually is at the edge of agroecological limits, while in subsoil, these limits are exeeded and the soil compilation reaches extreme values.","[Hammerova, A.; Jandak, J.; Brtnicky, M.; Hladky, J.; Hrabovska, B.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Hammerová, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",anna.hammerova@mendelu.cz,"Brtnický, Martin/AAV-1454-2020; Dvořáček, Jan/I-9472-2019","Brtnický, Martin/0000-0001-5237-722X; Dvořáček, Jan/0000-0002-1524-4062",,,,,9,3,3,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,296,300,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800051,0

They have grown lupin since 2005, with yields 1 or 2 t/ha and use lupin seeds for feeding milk-cows. The reason for our variety experiment was to find suitable low-alkaloid varieties of lupin for that area. The experiment lasted from 2009 to 2011. We seeded slightly different varieties each year. During three years we tested together 4 varieties of white lupin, 11 varieties of narrow-leafed lupin and 1 variety of yellow lupin. During all three years there were seeded 2 varieties of white lupin (Amiga, Dieta) and 6 varieties of narrow-leafed lupin (Boregine, Boruta, Galant, Probor, Rose, Viol). We seeded lupin during April each year. Lupin seeds were grinded (with exception of 2 varieties in 2010) and inoculated with root-nodule bacteria. After seeding we applicated pre-emergent herbicides. Harvest was divided according to the sort of lupin. Narrow-leafed lupin was harvested in August or September, white or yellow lupin was harvested in September or October. In 2009 there was heavy rainfall during the vegetation period. It influenced yields of white and narrow-leafed lupin, the yields were more than 3.5 t/ha. In next two years the rainfall was lower and the yields were lower too (around 2 t/ha). It is necessary to stress that the yields during the first year were negatively influenced by the strong attack of anthracnoses. During next two years we applicated suitable fungicide Amistar Xtra (1.0 l/ha). The best variety from narrow-leafed lupin was Boruta. But we found that after application of suitable fungicide white lupin can have the highest yields and highest content of Nitrogen substance in seeds.

However, simulations presented here suggest that information asymmetries and large uncertainties in predicting counterfactual business-as-usual (BAU) emissions are likely to render sectoral crediting an extremely unattractive mechanism in practice, at least for the transportation sector. The regulator faces a tradeoff between efficiency and transfers/environmental damage when setting the crediting baseline in relation to uncertain BAU emissions. A generous baseline promotes efficiency, as more developing countries participate and implement abatement measures. However, a generous baseline also produces large volumes of non-additional offsets, which lead to either increased global emissions, or transfers between developed and developing countries if developed country emission reduction targets are made more stringent in order to leave global emissions unchanged. I show that any crediting baseline that encourages a non-negligible number of countries to participate in a sectoral crediting mechanism results in environmental damage or transfers that are likely to be too high to be politically feasible.

The main objective of the firm investment policy should be the formation and realization of investment projects that could lead to the increase of the firm market value represented by its net present value. The process of the identification of optimal strategies under risk is done as the following: 1. The construction of multiperiodical balance models of investment projects, 2. The deterministic assessment of the efficiency of investment projects based on criteria of NPV, 3. The construction of simulation model of risk assessment and the selection of the optimal variant. The multiperiodical balance models covering a period of 20 years include cost structure estimation (cost of capital, working capital, variable and fixe operating costs), the estimation of production, depreciation, the financing of investment project (equity and loans), repayment scheduling and projected annual income statement, cash flow and the balance sheet. We use data from financial report of different farms situated in similar conditions and assessed by expert estimations. The deterministic assessment of the efficiency of different investment projects is based on the evaluation of the criteria of Net Present Value. The risk factors in the deterministic models are identified with the help of the sensitive analysis. The Simulation analysis is executed by the program Risk for Excel. We analysed three variants of projects, which differ only by structure. Variant 1 assumes that the total area of lands 25,26 ha is a combination of two vine varieties, in the first year 13,74 ha Chardonnay, in the second year 7,01 ha Cabernet Sauvignon and in the third year 4,45 ha Chardonnay. Variant 2 only counts with the planting of the variety Chardonnay and variant 3 with Cabernet Sauvignon. The best strategy it is considered the variant 2 at the value 51728 Euros. The second best option is the variant 1 with the value at 39595 Euros. The worst variant from the aspect of NPV value is the variant 3 at 36102 Euros. The, risk factors were identified through the sensitive analysis - selling price, and average annual yield. The risk factors in the following stochastic model are formulated as random variables with a certain probability distribution. The construction of distributions for criteria is executed by the program Risk. The simulation output is represented by the statistical results that describe each probability distribution for the simulated results. The investment efficiency can be evaluated based on critical values. The investor is willing to accept only a certain degree of risk. The perceptual values give the probability where the NPV falls under the value assigned to the given probability. With probability 20% we might expect for example that the NPV for the variant 2 will be less -4689 Eur. The criterion becomes positive only with a 25% risk level. It is only up to the investor to define up to what level he is willing to take the risk related to the investment.","[Repisky, Jozef] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,,jozef.repisky@uniag.sk,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,434,443,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600040,0

In this program each village surrounding state forests was entrusted with its own village forest. Each village forms an LMDH, which was a village level organization formed as a representative of the village that managed village's forest together with the State Forest Company. Tumpang sari was a conventional way to provide incentive to the communities to take part in the forest management. In the PHBM, tumpang sari and a timber sharing arrangement between the state and the communities were integrated to provide better incentive to the communities to participate in the management of state forest. Despite the PHBM implementation and the available timber sharing revenue, tumpang sari farmers and other community members still faced incentive problems that affected their contribution to forest management and their forest resource extraction pattern. The problem needed to be solved in the PHBM was the problem of compensation for the contributions of each stakeholder in forest resource management and protection. A more efficient timber sharing distribution is needed to solve the problem and to ensure a more cost-effective collective action for forest management and protection by the community at large.

States are committed to their WTO agreements, but they also have to act as a watchdog for their domestic industries in states that may not hold WTO agreements in high esteem. Interest group influence on the state has been examined through case studies, but never at the systemic level. I hypothesize that states being pressured by many interest groups are more likely to pursue a dispute into the higher levels of dispute resolution. I test this using data from the WTO as well as interests groups from around the world. I find that complainant states are more likely to be pressured by their interest groups to pursue a favourable outcome rather than settle or accept an earlier decision.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors that influence the decision to use such treatments and the willingness-to-pay of smokers for improved cessation drugs. A discrete choice experiment was conducted amongst smokers in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Choice sets consisted of two hypothetical medications described via five attributes (price, efficacy, possibility of minor side effects, attenuation of weight gain and availability) and an opt-out option. Various discrete choice models were estimated to analyse both the factors that influence treatment choice and those that influence the overall propensity to use a smoking cessation medication. Our results indicate that smokers are willing to pay for higher efficacy, less-frequent side effects and prevention of weight gain. Whether the drug is available over-the-counter or on medical prescription is of secondary importance. In addition, we show that there are several individual-specific factors influencing the decision to use such medications, including education level. Results also indicate substantial preference heterogeneity. This study shows that there is a potential demand for improved cessation medications. Broader usage could be reached through lower out-of-pocket price and greater efficacy. Secondary aspects such as side effects and weight gain should also be taken into consideration.","Univ Neuchatel, Fac Econ, Inst Res Econ, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel,"Marti, J (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Fac Econ, Inst Res Econ, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",joachim.marti@unine.ch,"Marti, Joachim/C-5141-2016","Marti, Joachim/0000-0001-5763-3704",,,,,60,23,25,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The paper begins by asking whether there is extensive overskilling in the labour market, and whether overskilling differs by education pathway. The answer to both questions is yes. The paper continues by asking whether overskilling is a self-perpetuating labour market state (state dependence), and whether state dependence differs by education pathway. Overskillal workers with a higher degree show the highest state dependence, while workers with vocational education show none. Workers with no post-school qualifications are somewhere between these two groups. The finding that higher degree graduates suffer the greatest overskilling state dependence, combined with the well-established finding that they also suffer the highest overskilling wage penalty, suggests that the cost of mismatch among this grouping are greater relative to vocationally qualified workers.

It is based on research undertaken as part of the Commonwealth funded South East Queensland Climate Adaptation Research Initiative (SEQ-CARI) that profiled 33 historical case studies to identify common themes in the ways societies responded to stress. The case studies are intended to provide a context for thinking about adaptive capacity with stakeholders in the four areas of human settlement and health; energy: agriculture, forestry and fisheries; and ecosystems and biodiversity. The case studies demonstrate that adaptive capacity varies with context and is affected by the complexity, technology, leadership, institutions and imaginative resources inherent to the social system examined. To increase the possibilities for reflection by stakeholders, the case studies were used to create a set of historical scenarios that explore some of the key features of human responses to challenges such as climate change.

Firms that choose WOSs generally have higher sales growth and superior profitability. However, the smaller the subsidiary and the less experienced the firm, the more likely that JVs will have better performance.","Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Human Resource Management, Chungli, Taiwan",National Central University,"Chen, MY (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Human Resource Management, Chungli, Taiwan.",mychen@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,10,13,1,45,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In a dynamic bio-economic model, we determine the feasibility conditions under which a fishery manager can achieve sustainability objectives which simultaneously account for stock conservation, economic efficiency and maintenance of fishing activity for the agents along time. We show how the viability of quota management strategies based on ITQ depends on the degree of heterogeneity of users in the fishery, the current status and the dynamics of the stock together with the selection of TAC schedules. In particular for a given stock, we compute the maximin effort for a given set of agents and we derive the maximal number of active agents for a given guaranteed effort. An application to the nephrops fishery in the Bay of Biscay illustrates the results.

In December 2006, after a series of WTO Appellate Body reports, the United States ceased zeroing in original investigations. The United States implemented the policy change prospectively, that is only for future cases. Consequently, the margins in this case remained unchanged because they had been calculated in 2004. Thailand challenged the United States' use of zeroing in the final determination. The US did not contest the claim. The Panel confirmed that zeroing was used and, following the long line of Appellate Body rulings, found the United States' practice inconsistent with Article 2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. After the Panel Report was adopted, the United States retroactively applied the policy change to the facts of this case and recalculated the margins without zeroing. The relative simplicity of the panel proceeding and the United States' willingness to amend the calculations following the adoption of the Panel Report may invite other WTO members to pursue a similar course of action in instances where their exporters have been subjected to US zeroing.","[Prusa, Thomas J.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Prusa, Thomas J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Prusa, TJ (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",prusa@econ.rutgers.edu; edwin.vermulst@vvgb-law.com,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2012,11.0,2.0,,,SI,,257,271,,10.1017/S1474745612000018,0.0,,,15,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,919YH,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302367600005,0

While providing a broad view and discussing a variety of contributions on this topic, the aim of this article is to offer a more constructivist approach to early detection studies than has been typically the case so far. The article starts by positioning the underlying problem of weak signals within the broader field of futures studies. The second section examines the Ansoffian tradition, first on the basis of Ansoffs own contributions, then through key enhancements offered by scholars working in the same perspective. The third section develops the arguments for a constructivist critique of the Ansoffian tradition as a way to renew and enrich scientific debate. The fourth and final section presents the main open issues where research, case studies, methods and applications still need to make significant progress in the vast domain of weak signal analysis and early detection.

In doing so, three major questions are posed: (1) how Foucauldian thinking has influenced the analysis of forest policy, (2) what has been excluded from the analysis, and (3) how a Foucauldian perspective contributes to an enhancement of the theoretical knowledge on forest policy as well as how it may be used in future analyses. Accordingly, in the first section, the Foucauldian concepts that have been the most influential to forest policy analysis, discourse, knowledge, and power as well as governmentality are introduced and summarized in a table aiming to outline a 'Foucauldian perspective'. Subsequently, thirty-nine papers on forest policy that draw on Foucauldian concepts are analyzed with regard to the following dimensions: author, academic background, research motivation, regional focuses, topics and time span covered by the analysis, disciplinary approach, frameworks, theoretical approach and Foucauldian concepts used, methods, main findings, and the conclusions drawn by the scholars about the value of using Foucault for their research. Additionally, the development of the studies over time is analyzed. It can be shown that Foucauldian thoughts have inspired the analysis of forest policy in two major ways: first, via post-structural political ecology studies and, second, via post-positivist discourse analysis. While nearly all of the papers were written by geographers, anthropologists, and policy analysts affiliated with European or North American universities, most of the studies analyzed forest policies in developing countries. Less frequently, conflicts about boreal forests were addressed. Consequently, two commonly found patterns were: an extension of the suppressive effects of colonial forest governmentalities into modern forest policies and discursive struggles about the use of forests. All of the papers shared some common elements, such as: a skeptical attitude towards claims of a single rationality and an objective truth and, in particular, toward central state and capitalist discourses; an interest in the suppressive effects of dominant types of language and knowledge; an understanding that language and knowledge need to be addressed as aspects of power; and an emancipatory motive and interest in broadening the available knowledge base and democratizing policy making. Finally, the results are discussed, and the initially posed questions are again addressed. It is recommended that the Foucauldian analysis of forest policy should literally escape from its own main discourse and address topics that were largely neglected until now. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the present article, we will argue that the present set of rules has advantages and deficiencies. We will argue that a better set of rules can be worked out for an ideal world but that we are not ready for an ideal world. In the meantime, we need to work with the rules as they exist. Even for the implementation of the existing rules, we can think of a radically different manner to proceed, for instance, by organizing the policy implementation at central level, in the WTO. Here again, we may be in dreamland for the years to come. When we then move to the real world, we will argue that the way forward lies in increasing the quality of the work by all the authorities that implement TDI and by increasing the communication and cooperation between those authorities. This may lead to reducing trade friction caused by cases. We will describe a major effort undertaken by the European Union to implement a quality management programme and we will discuss the possibilities for the authorities of EU's trading partners to cooperate in this effort and to benefit from it.",,,,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

It is important to diagnose this disease as soon as possible due to its high mortality. Prostate tissue has a unique ability to accumulate zinc ions. However cancer prostate tissue loses this ability. It is therefore possible to help the diagnosis of the prostate cancer via the isolation of zinc proteins contained in prostatic tissue. This isolation can be carried out using magnetic particles modified with anti-Zn-II-antibodies. Our objective was to create a procedure for isolation of zinc proteins from prostatic cells using magnetic particles and automated pipetting station. Cell lines PNT1A and LNCaP were used for experiments. Cell line PNT1A represents healthy prostate tissue, line LNCaP represent cancer tissue. There was decreasing level (10%) of Zn-II ions observed in the cancer prostatic cell lines for the 25 and 50 mu M concentrations of zinc.","[Dostalova, S.; Jilkova, E.; Krizkova, S.; Masarik, M.; Smerkova, K.; Hynek, D.; Ruttkay-Nedecky, B.; Krejcova, L.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Masarik, M.] Masaryk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol Physiol, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Krizkova, S.; Hynek, D.; Ruttkay-Nedecky, B.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Dostálová, S (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",kizek@sci.muni.cz,"Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Krejcova, Ludmila/E-8440-2012; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Masarik, Michal/D-9920-2012; Smerkova, Kristyna/F-3892-2012; Hynek, David/E-5702-2012; Krizkova, Sona/E-9617-2012; Rex, Simona/D-4951-2013","Krejcova, Ludmila/0000-0002-5199-2949; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Masarik, Michal/0000-0003-1172-7195; Smerkova, Kristyna/0000-0002-1667-7660; Krizkova, Sona/0000-0002-0479-8369; Rex, Simona/0000-0003-0737-3144",,,,,24,0,0,0,6,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1174,1182,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200137,0

We evaluated the gained information and we got clear image about frequency of the place, activities of inhabitants there, more and less used spaces. We were expecting more children, because of the summer holidays. Methods of Silhankova - Behavior mapping and Counting of movement of pedestrians show higher activity in Podhorany. Also Activities of people are in higher range. Due to that observation we may say, that during the day the places are mostly used for a transport of inhabitants (pedestrians/by car).

We are interested in stochastic volatility model where volatility is governed by logarithmic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The Kalman filter procedure is compared to an EGARCH estimation approach. Our empirical study is based on historical daily data of TUNINDEX on the period between 31 December 1997 which is its creation's date, and 31 December 2009. The empirical results show that movements in Tunindex returns and movements in volatility are correlated. Indeed, an unanticipated increase in Tunindex return leads to increased uncertainty that is greater than that induced by an unanticipated drop in return. In addition, estimates obtained from the two discretization schemes (Euler and ARCH) are quite similar. We also find that the stochastic volatility model provides an increase in volatility like the EGARCH (1,1) model. Thus, the two volatilities tend to be closer to their equilibrium value in the long term.","[Jilani, Faouzi; Ali, Hanen Ould] Innovat Strategy & Org, Tunis, Tunisia",,,faouzi.jilani@fsegt.rnu.tn; ouldalihanene@yahoo.fr; bensassi.salim@planet.tn,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2719,2733,,,,,,15,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801145,0

Their significance and usefulness grow as the changes on the domestic and international television market become more and more turbulent and rampant. Numerous attempts by television related companies to implement new business models have led to the necessity to consolidate the market, creating at the same time new sub-markets operating with involvement of companies which have so far operated within the Internet industry. The subject of analysis is viewing times in individual field and the development of broadcasting-related service as well as the technical capabilities enabling integration of television with the network communities. Interactive television creates a new market quality and at the same time destroys the notion of a viewer as a passive participant in the communication process. The combination of the television broadcasting's mass influence and the Internet's flexibility generates the ability to create new products and solutions. The presented new model of market competitiveness confirmed its effectiveness, when applying social strategies. Their implementation enables identification of additional revenue sources as well as creation of value innovations being a new source of thinking about these strategies, increasing the companies' operating effectiveness on the market and gaining a competitive advantage. Only the strategy of synergy of those three technologies (television, Internet and the social media) enables the achievement of a highly competitive market position.","[Kalisz, David E.] Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll Management & Finance, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Kalisz, DE (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll Management & Finance, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,1,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-540X,2543-5388,978-83-88421-80-8,BUS NON-PROFIT ORGAN,,,2012,11.0,,,,,,142,159,,,,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4CO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371504700012,0

The objective of my dissertation work is the evaluation of the exterior of the horse of the race Czech warm-blooded based on the linear description. Further the evaluation of individual exterior traits, which fathers pass on to their offspring and the set-up of a hereditary coefficient for the specific body type traits. These traits are evaluated in such a way as to improve, after excluding the shortcomings in the body structure, movement mechanics, display of performance and with the exclusion of genetic defects and diseases, the quality and health of the bred horses. Stallion horses with at least 7 descendants were used for the evaluation and determination of the values, as well as mares which underwent a linear description of traits at the age of 3 years. Data from the year 1996 are used for this evaluation, which comprises a total of around 10300 mares and more than 500 000 records related to the linear description. When evaluating the exterior of the horses we cannot rule out other external factors which may influence the evaluation and performance of the horses at the moment of the assessment. Just as the personality of the evaluator is also not always the same. The evaluation, description of body traits and linear description are carried out when the characteristics are registered in the breeding books, at shows, at exhibitions, or at performance tests, in some cases on the basis of an application submitted by the horse breeder. The linear description is registerd by the evaluator in the description letter. The evaluated traits are: height at withers, chest girth, shin girth, type, full-bloodedness, neck length, neck tethering, topline length, loin length, loin form, length of the back, inclination of the back, shoulder blade, forefeet, forehoof, posture of the hind limbs, hindfeet, hind hoof, body width, form of the back, step spaciousness, trot spaciousness.

Genotypes UC66049 and Tschermaks Blaukorniger Sommerweizen have blue aleurone. Genotypes Abissinskaja an-asajta and ANK-28B have purple pericarp. Genotype Novosibirskaja 67 was used as standard. It has a white caryopsis as well as a genotype Heroldo (a form of winter wheat). RNA from caryopsis was isolated using phenol-chloroform extraction and revese transcribed into cDNA. House keeping gene GAPDH (the gene for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was chosen as a control for PCR to verify the successful transcription of cDNA. For designing primers we used the cDNA sequences for CHI and DFR obtained from the database NCBI were used for primers designing. Via PCR reactions were amplified segments of sequences for CHI and DFR, which were used for direct sequencing of PCR product. The obtained candidate sequences were compared with sequences in the NCBI database and their polymorphisms were evaluated. We aquired a partial sequence for genes chalcone isomerase and dihydroflavanol reductase. By comparing sequences for each gene was found homology in the range from 95 to 100%. The variability caused single nucleotide polymorphism and indels. Sequences were sent to the Laboratory of Molecular Cytogenetics and Cytometry, Institute of Experimental Botany, Olomouc. There were compared our cDNA sequences with BAC library of wheat chromosomes. A sequence for CHI was found on chromosome 5B. In the case of DFR was found a sequence on 3B and on long arm 3A chromosome. Downstream step in this work is to get the whole sequence of the transcribed genes by 3'RACE and 5'RACE PCR reactions. Furthermore, the complete cDNA sequences will be compared with genomic DNA sequences to determine the presence of introns in genes.

The vendor and buyers apply Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) mode of operation. The vendor gives the product to the buyers. The operational parameters are sales quantity, sales price and maximum number of stockouts for each buyer at the vendor's location. Channel profit of the supply chain and contract price between the vendor and buyers are determined based on the operational parameters. In order to find out the optimal values of the parameters, a mathematical model is formulated. Two heuristics are proposed to solve the addressed problem. Some numerical problems are provided and each problem is solved utilizing the heuristics. We have also solved the sample problems utilizing LINGO optimization solver in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","[Seifbarghy, Mehdi; Gilkalayeh, Ali Pourebrahim] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin Branch, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Seifbarghy, M (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin Branch, Tehran, Iran.",M.Seifbarghy@qiau.ac.ir; alipourebrahim.64@gmail.com,"Seifbarghy, Mehdi/V-8731-2019","Seifbarghy, Mehdi/0000-0002-0772-4509",,,,,27,3,4,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

These researches assume that the duration of activities is known either with certitude or at least with some probability. However, in many applications the structure of the duration of activities is imprecise. In this paper, the project scheduling problem with discounted cash flows under fuzzy environment is considered. The duration of activities are assumed triangular fuzzy numbers. The derived mathematical model is a multi-objective non-linear programming model and for solving it the Taylor expansion is used to transform the objective function to a linear form. To interpret the fuzzy solution of the model, a procedure which can be used for other similar problems is proposed. Finally, an example is solved and the proposed procedure is applied to interpret the fuzzy solutions.","[Najafi, Amir Abbas] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Shavandi, Hassan] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Moslehirad, Alireza] Qazvin Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Math, Qazvin, Iran",K.

Differential regulations of identified proteins correlated with hormonal profiling and physiology status of treated plants. Measurement of stomata movement, thermocamera plant body temperature screening and hormonal and proteomic profiling indicate that temperature response in Arabidopsis thaliana is influenced by plant hormone cytokinin signaling.

The supply chains have been analysed based on a conceptual framework of mechanisms underlying supply chain management. After comparing the selected fruit supply chains against the conceptual framework, critical success factors (CSFs) were derived for fruit supply chain innovativeness. For every type of fruit chain, it is important to have a customer focus, a quality management system implementing tracking and tracing, and a lead firm in the chain that initiates, stimulates and coordinates the implementation of innovations. A typology of consumer driven innovative fruit supply chains is proposed based on the different combinations of network use and formality of the innovation strategy in the chains. The choice of type for a chain depends on the entrepreneurial style, type of product (fresh or processed) and size of the companies.

In the year 2010, the crossbred boars semen used in the insemination was 14.77%, and 26.30% for the hybrids. The semen collected from crossbred boars (Duroc x Pietrain) and hybrids (PIC) enjoyed the most popular in the insemination. The aim of this study was to compare the semen characteristics of crossbred (Duroc x Pietrain) and hybrids (PIC and NECKAR) boars. Materials for the study were 747 ejaculates collected from 10 boars by one year (2010). Semen was collected using manual method. The following traits were identified among physical characteristics of ejaculates: volume (ml), spermatozoa concentration (thousand/mm(3)), the number of live spermatozoa (%), the content of spermatozoa in the ejaculate (billions), the number of insemination doses produced from a one ejaculate (units). Furthermore, ejaculates divided into two groups, depending on the lean content of boars (group I. <= 60% and group II.. 60%). Boars lean content was determined by performance test. It was found that the characteristics of boar semen have changed depending on the genotype, season and lean content of boars. Semen of crossbred boars was characterized by significantly higher volume and number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate than ejaculates obtained from hybrids, which them produced more insemination doses (P <= 0.05). Both crossbred and hybrids boars responded similarly to changes in the seasons. Best ejaculates were obtained in the autumn and winter months. At the turn of October and November there was observed dynamically increase in the spermatozoa concentration of the boars semen. Variability of hybrids boars ejaculates was greater than the crossbred. Moreover there was determined a negative impact of high meatiness of boars on volume of the ejaculates.","[Zejer, P.; Milewska, W.] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Anim Bioengeenering, Dept Pig Breeding, PL-10957 Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Zejer, P (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Anim Bioengeenering, Dept Pig Breeding, Oczapowskiego 5, PL-10957 Olsztyn, Poland.",malwa@uwm.edu.pl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,380,384,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200046,0

Furthermore, by utilizing China's provincial panel data between 2000 and 2010 combined with the level of provincial financial development, we examine industrial agglomeration effects in different areas caused by FDI through building the panel threshold regression model, which proves the fact that there exist many considerable provincial and regional disparities in the influence of FDI on our country's industrial agglomeration. And based on the fact, further regression calculations are made in the matter of the threshold effect of financial development that leads to industrial agglomeration effect; in addition, the empirical results reveals that the level of financial development, as an important factor to cause industrial agglomeration, can play an inter-transmitting role effectively and promote industrial agglomeration.","[Zhou, Bing] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Accounting Coll, Res Ctr Econ Upper Reaches Yangtze River, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China",Chongqing Technology & Business University,,,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,6,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,55,57,,,,,,3,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816300012,0

The GAT'S existing four modes of supply do not adequately cover this type of indirect services value-added trade. Hence, theoretically, the case for a new indirect mode of services supply - 'mode 5' - is made. On the basis of the TiVA database, our estimates of mode 5 services exports point to a substantial share of total merchandise trade. The article also finds that from a 'mode 5' perspective, services embodied into products are also subject to fairly complex trade rules. One such example illustrated in tins article is the area of customs valuation. Other issues (trade facilitation, rules of origin) could have an impact on the way 'mode 5' services are traded. The renewed impetus at the WTO on trade facilitation and the post-Bali agenda should provide a new opportunity for policy makers to forge trade rules that are well-suited fir the ways in which goods and services interact along global supply chains.","[Cernat, Lucian] Commiss European Communities, DG TRADE, Brussels, Belgium; [Kutlina-Dimitrova, Zornitsa] Chief Economist & Trade Anal Unit DG TRADE, Brussels, Belgium",,"Cernat, L (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, DG TRADE, Brussels, Belgium.",Lucian.Cernat@ec.europe.eu; Zornitsa.Kutlina-Dimitrova@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,14,18,19,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Furthermore, researchers have focused on the impact of merit aid on enrollment and outcomes during college, but to my knowledge, none have yet considered the impact of aid on earnings after college. This paper utilizes discontinuities in eligibility criteria for a large merit scholarship to examine the local impact of aid on student outcomes both during college and after college. The findings suggest that reducing the cost of community college does not impact persistence, academic performance, degree completion, expected earnings, or short-term earnings after college for marginally eligible students.

The assessment is made within the Dutch BioSolar Cells (BSCs) research programme on photosynthesis and its application in fuel production. Part of the programme is committed to societal debate by considering different options and uses of biosolar technology. To provide building blocks for these discussions, we conducted a comprehensive desk study supplemented with key expert interviews, and we identified and articulated the main drivers for the Dutch transition towards more sustainable energy supply. Next, these drivers were used to develop two futures: energy port and energy farm, representing institutional settings in which BSC technology could be implemented. Both represent fundamentally different types of innovation and are useful in assessing the effect of policies on future energy systems. Both scenarios were used in workshops with BSC researchers and policymakers. Their possible implications for the BSC programme itself, as well as the broader policy significance of the use of biosolar technologies in the Netherlands, are indicated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

They spend more time at home in planning, searching, socializing online, cumulating and fulfilling internet orders than if they had visited a store: something that all could easily do.

The article is based on several exchanges between health care experts within the framework of a working group coordinated by the authors. This article argues that there is a possibility of change in the determinants of health care demand in developed countries. Over the medium and long-term, health care demand might no longer be expressed mostly by patients asserting their right to treatment. Instead it will be motivated more by the duty of each citizen to do everything possible to stay healthy. This transition from a right to a duty is a logical extension of various movements already observed in the health care sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting deterioration in the quality of employment has exacerbated the longer-term trend of rising inequality. Jobless growth has dampened output growth through a worsening income distribution. Wages are costs on the supply side but are also incomes on the demand side, so that profit-led growth and wage-led growth are complements, not substitutes. Thus, growth can create jobs, while added jobs can drive growth. More employment and better jobs can also mitigate rising inequality. If macroeconomic policies focus on fostering employment creation and supporting economic growth, rather than on price stability and balanced budgets, employment would revive growth and reduce inequality.","Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi 110067, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Nayyar, D (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi 110067, India.",nayyar.deepak@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,10,10,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

This article argues first that the Eurozone policy framework can be viewed as neo-liberalism overlaid with policy constraints associated with a mis-specified Optimum Currency Area. We are critical of this framework since it is incompatible with the policy sovereignty that is experienced, if not utilised, by sovereign economies such as the USA, UK and Australia. Second, recent and proposed policy reforms which generally lie within the constraints of the Eurozone framework are examined. We conclude that these policies are piecemeal and fail to restore policy sovereignty, which ultimately requires that member countries exit the Eurozone. Key issues associated with such an exit are briefly discussed.","[Watts, Martin; Juniper, James] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Full Employment & Equ, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia; [Sharpe, Timothy] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England",University of Newcastle; Nottingham Trent University,"Watts, M (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Ctr Full Employment & Equ, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia.",martin.watts@newcastle.edu.au,"Watts, Martin J/G-7218-2013","WATTS, Martin/0000-0003-4724-964X",,,,,52,3,4,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

J,"Beerden, K",,,,"Beerden, Kim",,,Ancient Greek futures: Diminishing uncertainties by means of divination,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper analyzes forecasting in the ancient Greek world. Forecasting was practiced by the use of a particular method: that of divination. Divination was the interpretation of signs perceived to have been sent by the supernatural. This practice can be seen as an ancient alternative to risk assessment/analysis and to scenario studies. The study of divination shows that ancient Greeks believed there were multiple futures - and not one predetermined future - from which man attempted to select the best, aided by the flexible tool that divination appears to be. The Greek future is, perhaps, more like our own than it may previously have been assumed. Ideas about how this future should be come to terms with, however, differ significantly. The absence of concepts of risk and probability are one difference, the use of the supernatural to assess uncertainties is another. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Benefit transfer was used to estimate use values for sport fishing and non-use values in terms of existence values. The results show that the optimal share of acidified forest land that should be treated with ash depends on how optimistic one is about the effect of using ash to restore lakes and streams from acidification. More optimistic assumptions imply that the ash to larger extent should be used to ameliorate acidification. Using the most realistic assumption, given the experiences of forest liming, shows that acidified forest land should not be treated with ash with the aim of restoring lakes and streams from acidification. From a socioeconomic point of view, ash simply does more good as fertilizer on forested organic soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence that the density of hospital beds contributes to the fall in traffic-related fatalities.

Social costs include all municipal costs and revenues, costs to recycling households to prepare materials estimated with an original method, external disposal costs, and external recycling benefits. Results suggest average social costs are minimized with recycling rates well below observed and mandated levels in Japan. Cost-minimizing municipalities are estimated to recycle less than the optimal rate. These results are robust to changes in the components of social costs, indicating that Japan and perhaps other developed countries may be setting inefficiently high recycling goals.

Cultural Processes and Causal Pathways to Inequality'",SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,inequality; economic sociology; cultural processes,RELATIONAL FOUNDATIONS; GENDER; BOUNDARIES; COMPLEXITY; DUALITY; AGENCY; WAGES; POWER; U.S.,"The preceding article by Lamont, Beljean and Clair (LBC) entitled 'What is Missing? Cultural Processes and Causal Pathways to Inequality' invites us to extend our socio-economic imagination regarding inequality. While much economic and social inequality is structural in nature, LBC discuss how the human experience of inequalities is strongly grounded in cultural process. Cultural processes here include both identification and rationalization, which LBC discuss in relation to four processes: racialization and stigmatization (for identification) and standardization and evaluation (for rationalization). While cultural processes are the contested terrain within which inequalities are shaped and played out, LBC argue why scholars should pay stronger attention to them than in previous research. Socio-Economic Review invited a group of leading scholars in the fields of inequality and cultural process to discuss the paper of LBC, and relate this both to their past work and the future of inequality research. Douglas Massey opens with a reflection on why US sociology in particular has neglected the role of culture in the study of inequality. The next two contributions by Leslie McCall and co-authors Donald Tomaskovic-Devey and Dustin Avent-Holt raise important questions about how the cultural processes described by LBC relate to the analysis of social structures, such as political discourses or the meso-level dynamics of organizations. Finally, Monin, Forgues and Wang look at how cultural processes operate in organizational settings, and use these insights to analyse the boundary conditions thereof.","[Massey, Douglas S.] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [McCall, Leslie] Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, Evanston, IL USA; [McCall, Leslie] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL USA; [Tomaskovic-Devey, Donald] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Sociol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Avent-Holt, Dustin] Georgia Regents Univ, Dept Sociol, Augusta, GA USA; [Monin, Philippe; Forgues, Bernard; Wang, Tao] EMLYON Business Sch, Ecully, France",Princeton University; Northwestern University; Northwestern University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University System of Georgia; Augusta University; emlyon business school,"Massey, DS (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dmassey@princeton.edu; l-mccall@northwestern.edu; tomaskovic-devey@soc.umass.edu; monin@em-lyon.com,"Forgues, Bernard/HLX-6635-2023; Monin, Philippe/AAO-8201-2021","Forgues, Bernard/0000-0001-7772-8436;",,,,,94,5,8,0,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.
