Regression estimates of father-son correlations and analyses of intergenerational transition matrices show substantial persistence in wealth even when we correct for measurement errors in parental wealth. We do not find wealth mobility to be higher between periods of a person's life than between generations. We find that the process of household division plays an important role: sons who splinter off from the father's household experience greater (albeit downward) mobility in wealth. Despite significant occupational mobility across generations, its contribution to wealth mobility, net of human capital attainment of individuals, appears insignificant. Low wealth mobility in our data is primarily explained by intergenerational persistence in educational attainment.","[Asadullah, M.

In the wake of the consequent increased pressure on the resource, it behooves landowners to use water more productively and responsibly. This paper calculated the marginal product value (MPV) of irrigation water for potatoes and vine production in this region to assess and to allow the comparison of the productivity of irrigation water with other commodities and regions. However, the results suggested that the scope for leveraging changes to water use behaviour in the Sandveld solely through water pricing is limited. Given that electricity is a critical input for the utilization of groundwater, we suspect that the price of electricity would be a suitable lever to influence irrigation behaviour. In light of the imminent Government electricity price hikes, we advise some further investigation on the impacts these impending hikes will have on irrigation farming in the study area. We suspect that pumping costs (as opposed to the price of water itself) will become the most limiting factor for irrigation water use in the Sandveld in the foreseeable future. A mixture of water and energy pricing strategies therefore lends itself as a more pragmatic policy approach to follow in order to influence irrigation behaviour, as opposed to a sole focus on water pricing.","[de Lange, W.

In Romania the innovation governance has been implemented and considered only recently, in the context of its imperative request from the European Union accession in January 2007. Up to this stage, there are serious deficiencies in the innovation governance at regional level, especially because of the lack of regional focus of the innovation policies in the context of European integration and multi-level governance challenges in Romania as EU New Member State. The present paper presents the case of North-West region of Romania as a leading knowledge region and uses its success story as a model for the other Romanian regions. The experience gained in this region, before EU accession of Romania, through implementation of Regional Innovation Strategies RIS, in the purpose of identifying the regional innovation potential and encourage technological transfer between research and business communities and create a regional innovation strategy and a future action plan, and after Romania's EU accession - through implementation projects funded by the 2007-2013 National RDI Plan, Regional Operational Programme and Increasing Economic Competitiveness Operational Programme etc., are convincing arguments to empower the role of regional innovation governance. According to the Romanian Innovation barometer, in 2008, the North-West region was the third region regarding innovation, after Bucharest-Ilfov, the region containing the capital city, and South-East region. The present paper identifies the determinants of success and sources of failures and makes policy recommendations for the local, regional and national government as well.

It is understandable as network industries in fact ensure the production and distribution of energy sources which play a key role in developed economies. The discussions are usually focused on the question of reasonable profit of network industries subjects and on the other hand the question of generally acceptable costs. Equilibrium on the network industries market, as well as on any market, is being created based on the level of demand and supply on relevant market. In this article we will discuss the analysis of optimization models of consumers and producers behavior on the network industries market as well as the question of effectiveness of this specific market. We will point out certain features of network industries market where the consumer usually is not able to substitute a product of network industry with other product of appropriate characteristics in a short time period, thus considering the product being exclusive. This exclusivity can be formally represented in the utility function and other related analytical tasks.

The study also aims at exploring whether the CAPM is applicable in DSE. For this study we have been used monthly stock returns from 80 non-financial companies for the period of January 2005 to December 2009. In order to examine the risk-return trade off in a sample of individual stocks, we apply the usual two stages regression. From the CAPM empirical analysis for individual stocks, it is observed that intercept term is significantly different from zero and slope is not equal to the excess return on the market portfolio. But, the CAPM's prediction for the intercept is that it should equal zero and the slope should equal the excess returns on the market portfolio. So, the results of the study refute the above hypothesis and offer evidence against the CAPM. Thus, it can be concluded that CAPM is not a suitable indicator of asset prices in Bangladesh over the chosen sample period. The securities market line shows linearity which means that the CAPM linear relationship is enough to express the returns generating process. Moreover, the investors are rewarded for market risk but not for unique risk because unique risk shows insignificancy during the period. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

On a pragmatic approach of business ethics, companies are developing their contribution to social causes by considering a large area of corporate social responsibility CSR projects, aimed at inducing bidirectional benefits, expressed at corporate and societal level. Taking this general context into account, the aim of our present research paper is to investigate and measure the corporate participation in supporting art and culture initiatives in Romania and Bulgaria, in a comparative and empirical approach intended to shed a new light on the development of specific CSR in the two above mentioned countries. In this respect, we analyze the top companies by revenues in Romania and Bulgaria and we construct an innovative index AC-CSR Index for quantifying their implication in art and culture projects in the last years, as a part of their recognized accountability towards society as a whole. The AC-CSR Index, derived as a composite measure of arts and culture actions, aims at encompassing the performance of top companies regarding a broad-spectrum of corporate culture responsibility engagements. The main results emphasize an increasing thoughtfulness of companies in Romania and Bulgaria to this class of CSR projects, especially considering the leader position of the analyzed companies.

The trend of relative government debt growths observed since 1970s, after a short period of improvement at the beginning of new millennium, were again accelerated by the economic and financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Considering the high levels of public debt, projections of rather mild and unsure economic recovery and the demographic pressures on public finances, the current situation seem to be serious, requiring large scale consolidation steps. The fiscal policy literature has paid much attention to explanation of public finance deficit bias and to optimal fiscal policies, as well as to proposals of fiscal institutions aiming to prevent the bias and to bring public finances to a sustainable path. One of the most frequently discussed options is establishing independent fiscal councils. The paper, after briefly summarizing the state of the art research on the topic and showing the most recent development in implementation of independent fiscal councils in EU countries, analyses on fiscal performance of EU countries in the period of economic crisis. The analysis showed that there was significant difference in fiscal behavior between both groups of countries, with and without existing independent fiscal council.","[Jilek, Milan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,,jilek@ef.jcu.cz,"Jilek, Milan/M-7618-2013","Jilek, Milan/0000-0002-8422-3927",,,,,18,0,0,0,4,WOLTERS KLUWER CR A S,PRAHA 3,"U NAKLADOVEHO NADRAZI 6, PRAHA 3, PRAGUE 130 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7478-012-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,122,133,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJP92,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329534700012,0

It is assumed that individual farmers develop strategic approaches to their future farming activities (farm household strategies) in order to react to these developments. This involves reconsidering existing approaches and developing new strategies, both on and off the farm. In order to evaluate these developments, it is necessary to first evaluate the current pattern of farm household strategies. This paper identifies and examines the farm household strategies of Austrian dairy farmers in order to better understand farm household development. Secondary data analyses on the basis of a survey of Austrian dairy farms conducted by the Federal Institute of Agricultural Economics Vienna provided the required information for the empirical identification of various types of farm household strategy. The analyses revealed a pattern of six types of farm household strategy within Austrian dairy farms: (1) genuine specialisation, (2) concentration, (3) horizontal diversification, (4) lateral diversification, (5) stable reproduction, and (6) disengagement. The study underlines the significance of socio-economic as well as demographic and farm characteristics which were used to identify and describe types of farm household strategy.","[Krammer, Monika] Fed Minist Agr Forestry Environm & Water Manageme, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Larcher, Manuela; Vogel, Stefan] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Lautsch, Erwin] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Universitat Kassel","Krammer, M (通讯作者)，Fed Minist Agr Forestry Environm & Water Manageme, Div III-6 Milk Stubenring 12, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",monika.krammer@lebensministerium.at,"Vogel, Stefan/ABA-4508-2020","Vogel, Stefan/0000-0001-8629-0659","Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management","Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management","We would like to thank the Federal Institute of Agricultural Economics Vienna for the provision of the data for these analyses, which were collected in the course of a study financed by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management.",,52,7,7,0,7,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Cognitive acuity is a new construct defined as the capacity to detect correctness and to distinguish between differences in correctness among simultaneously presented situation-specific response options. Borrowing from the Weber-Fechner law of stimulus and response, a method for measuring sensitivity to correctness signals (i.e., cognitive acuity) was tested on SJT item responses. TCA proposes measuring respondents' sensitivity to the correctness signals emitted by ambiguously correct (or valent) response options using a two-parameter model of signal detection based on (a) the respondent's level of signal sensitivity (i.e., cognitive acuity) and (b) the magnitude or level of that signal. The extent to which cognitive acuity is a direct determinant of SJT performance and an indirect determinant of observed on-the-job decision-making (OTJDM) performance was also examined. Results showed that both individual and contrasted response option signals are related to a respondent's selection of a response option. Further, like sensory stimuli, SJT response option signals are logarithmically related to their detectability. Using this logarithmic function, just noticeable differences were estimated for each respondent and served as cognitive acuity measures, evidencing very small subgroup differences. Finally, using structural equation modeling, cognitive acuity was found to act as an initial variable in a fully mediated acuity-SJT-OTJDM performance relationship contributing indirectly to criterion-related job performance variance.","US Merit Syst Protect Board, Washington, DC 20419 USA",,"Leeds, JP (通讯作者)，US Merit Syst Protect Board, 1615 M St Northwest, Washington, DC 20419 USA.",iamjleeds@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,11,15,0,7,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The negative effects of this lack of balance can be seen especially in the scarcity of biodiversity. Studies show that thousands of species are endangered, whereas more than 300 species have already disappeared. It is therefore necessary to come up with ideas and implement projects for the conservation of biodiversity in protected natural areas to reduce the pressure over rare species. This is impossible without education, information, without raising awareness regarding the importance of protected natural areas.

According to the impulse response results, the J-Curve effect exists in the Turkish Economy Thus, competitiveness oriented currency, monetary and fiscal policies must be efficiently designed and applied in the Turkish Economy to achieve sustainable current account balance path.","[Okay, Esin; Baytar, Rana Atabay] Istanbul Commerce Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Saridogan, Ercan] Marmara Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Ticaret University; Marmara University,"Okay, E (通讯作者)，Istanbul Commerce Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",eokay@iticu.edu.tr; ratabay@iticu.edu.tr; ercan-saridogan@marmara.edu.tr,"SARIDOGAN, Ercan/J-4195-2018","Saridogan, Ercan/0000-0002-7893-8686",,,,,49,1,2,2,18,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

That decade was of particular significance in the post-war history of Central and Eastern Europe. For the first time after the World War II, Poland - a major country in the socialist block - opened up to western economies by increasing foreign trade and by taking loans to finance the imports of modern technology and investments. Since there has been a major disagreement about the economic impact of the loans, we make an attempt to resolve this controversy. The considerations are conducted in a macroeconomic model. Based on the econometric analysis, we conclude that the efficiency of foreign investment borrowing was relatively high.

Structured products have become more and more complex. We study the question whether this complexity might be a sophisticated method to exploit systematic biases in probability estimation of investors in order to make products look safer and more attractive than they actually are. We present results of an experiment that focused on probability estimates in the context of certain classes of structured products, in particular barrier reverse convertibles, bonus certificates, and worst-of basket certificates. We find that behavioral biases, for example, the conjunction fallacy, increase the subjective attractiveness of these product types. We also investigate potential ways to de-bias investors by providing additional information.","Univ Trier, Chair Banking & Finance, ISB, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Rieger, MO (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Chair Banking & Finance, ISB, Univ Sring 15, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",mrieger@uni-trier.de,,,,,,,15,29,32,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The empirical results based on an augmented production function indicate that air transport is positively related with economic growth, industrial structure, population density, and openness, but negatively related with ground transportation. The development of air transport, however, varies significantly across regions in terms of growth and competition with ground transport. The competition has become particularly intense in recent years, as high-speed railways have become a formidable challenge to air transport between the short-and mid-range transportation routes.","[Yao, Shujie; Yang, Xiuyun] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710049, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Yang, XY (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",Shujie.yao@nottingham.ac.uk; yangxiuyun@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,21,31,32,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

A face-to-face survey was conducted on the residents of public housing in Penang; one of the states with significantly developed towns in Malaysia. The respondents were selected using the stratified random sampling. The data were analysed using the descriptive analysis and Pearson product-moment correlation. The results suggest that 'work necessary to maintain the safety and health of residents', 'work necessary to keep property habitable' and 'work necessary to keep buildings operable' as the most important reasons for the requirement for maintenance.

Their posterior distributions are then used for the calculation of empirical versions of the Banzhaf and the Shapley-Shubik index, invoking the concepts of connected coalitions and bloc voting. Our ideal point estimates indicate significant differences between member states' preferences, which often translate into significant differences between empirical and theoretical power under individual voting. However, the formation of voting blocs appears to offset differences in countries' ideal points as the bloc size grows.

Second, because the system is based on taxing mobile activities, it invites countries to compete with each other to attract economic activity and to favour domestic' companies.

The determinants of job-to-job and job-to-nonemployment transitions are analyzed with the help of a multinomial logit estimation method. The results indicate that there is a distinction regarding the probability of job mobility patterns based on gender. It is more likely for women to be engaged in job-to-nonemployment transition, whereas men tend to change jobs more often. Although gender plays a significant role in job mobility patterns, traditionally imposed social constraints associated with childcare and household duties provide us with mixed results considering the behavior of women in the job market. On the other hand, having highly paid and secure jobs decreases the probability of both patterns of job mobility.","[Eryar, Deger] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey; [Tekguc, Hasan] Mardin Artuklu Univ, Dept Econ, Mardin, Turkey",Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi; Mardin Artuklu University,"Eryar, D (通讯作者)，Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey.",Deger.eryar@ieu.edu.tr,"; Tekguc, Hasan/C-9910-2019","Eryar, Sitki Deger/0000-0002-5989-880X; Tekguc, Hasan/0000-0002-3902-4486",,,,,38,1,1,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

On the other hand, as firms hiring temporary workers have less incentive to train them, it is difficult for low-skilled temporary workers to find better jobs in the future. This study examines the effect of TAW experience on employment transitions in the Japanese labor market, focusing on individual time preferences. Investments in one's career involve a trade-off between immediate costs and future rewards, and thus individual heterogeneity in time preferences may explain the behavioral patterns of the labor force in career choices. The results indicate that those who have a higher degree of impatience are likely to engage in the TAW sector. In addition, those who have held temporary jobs are less likely to move into regular job positions, but no significant wage differences are observed between those with the TAW experience and those without the TAW experience. The observed negative effect of TAW on the transition probability into regular employment becomes smaller or statistically insignificant, when time preferences are additionally controlled for. The combined findings suggest that the possible negative effect may be attributed to the difference in the time preferences between individuals with the TAW experience and those without. J.

To do so, the household can either adopt a sequential search strategy or a simultaneous search strategy. In sequential strategies, it first buys (or sells) and only after tries to sell (or buy) to avoid being homeless (or holding two houses). In the simultaneous strategy, the household tries to buy and sell simultaneously on the market. This last strategy can diminish its search costs on the housing market, but exposes the household to the risk of becoming a homeless-renter or a two-houses owner. The literature generally considers only the sequential search strategy. However, we show in this article that the simultaneous strategy is (i) generally welfare improving for households, (ii) sometimes the sole equilibrium strategy, and (iii) at the origin of price dispersion on the housing market.

Transparent funds (e.g., mutual funds) and opaque funds (e.g., hedge funds) trade transparent assets (e.g., plain-vanilla products) and opaque assets (e.g., structured products). Investors observe neither opaque funds' portfolios nor opaque assets' payoffs. Consistent with empirical observations, an opacity price premium arises: opaque assets trade at a premium over transparent ones despite identical payoffs. This accompanies endogenous market segmentation: transparent (opaque) funds trade only transparent (opaque) assets. The opacity price premium incentivizes financial engineers to render transparent assets opaque deliberately.","[Sato, Yuki] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sato, Yuki] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Sato, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Dept Finance, UNIL Dorigny, Extranef 235, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",yuki.sato@unil.ch,,,,,,,40,16,19,2,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We extend previous literature on mortgage choice as a tool for borrower risk screening under asymmetric information by incorporating house price externalities. The novelty in our setup is that house prices in the second period are negatively affected by the first-period default rate. We show that when these negative externalities are large, lenders may benefit by offering a lower ARM rate. This outcome, in turn, influences the likelihood of a separating equilibrium in which high-risk (low-risk) borrowers choose ARMs (FRMs) relative to a pooling equilibrium in which both high-risk and low-risk borrowers receive the same contract. When the impact of the negative house price externalities is small, it is more likely that lenders will offer pooling contracts; however, when the impact of the house price externalities is large, it is more likely that lenders will offer separating contracts. We also compare the equilibrium default rates across different contract offerings and find that when the negative house price externalities are large, the pooling FRM contract or the separating contract tends to offer the lowest default rate; however, when the negative house price externalities are small, the pooling ARM contract may result in the lowest default rate.

This has implications for solidarity and for the sustainability of social protection systems. By applying citizenship theories to social protection, we show that duties need not be carried solely by the state or forced upon beneficiaries as conditional requirements. Rather, as citizens are both productive and vulnerable, all citizens fulfill duties and hold rights, although their contributions to and needs for social protection vary. Sustainable social protection policies thus enhance citizens' agency as both rights-holders and duty-bearers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The distribution of these costs is especially important in affecting political outcomes. This paper links dynamic overlapping-generations and microsimulation models of the United States to estimate the initial incidence of a carbon tax across states. Geographic differences in incidence are driven primarily by differences in sources of income. Differing patterns of energy use also matter but are relatively less important. The use of the carbon tax revenue plays an important role, particularly in determining how different income sources are affected, as (1) using carbon tax revenue to cut capital taxes disproportionately benefits states with large shares of capital income; (2) returning the revenue via lump-sum transfers favors relatively low-income states; and (3) returning the revenue via cuts in labor taxes provides a relatively even distribution of cost across states.

First, tax multipliers are little affected by being a Eurozone country or not, or by experiencing the Eurozone crisis.

Economywide Analysis for Ethiopia and Uganda,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Structural transformation; Urban agglomeration; Economic growth; Poverty; Africa,AGRICULTURE; COUNTRIES; LINKAGES; GROWTH; IMPACT; POOR,"Rapid urbanization is an important characteristic of African development and yet the structural transformation debate focuses on agriculture's relative merits without also considering the benefits from urban agglomeration. As a result, African governments are often provided conflicting recommendations on the importance of rural agriculture or urban industry. We develop dynamic economywide models for Ethiopia and Uganda that capture both traditional aspects of the debate (growth linkages and foreign trade) and benefits from urbanization (internal migration and agglomeration effects). Simulations suggest that urban agglomeration is an important source of long-term growth and structural transformation, but that investing in cities does not greatly reduce national poverty over the short-term. In this regard, agricultural growth is more effective, albeit with slower national growth. Given these trade-offs, we conclude that, while urbanization's benefits argue against an agro-fundamentalist approach to African development, the short-term imperative of reducing poverty necessitates further agricultural investment.

The paper identifies the export-promoting effect of emigration on the firm-level using Danish data for the year 2001. Accounting for taste similarity, self-selection and unobserved heterogeneity, three main findings are established. First, the elasticity of manufacturing exports to emigration is robust and of similar size as the effect of immigration. Secondly, only immigration encourages market entry but not emigration, suggesting that variable cost reductions and demand for home-country products are the driving force of emigrant network effects. Thirdly, benefits from emigration accrue exclusively to low-productivity firms.","[Hiller, Sanne] Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Hiller, Sanne] Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Ruhr University Bochum; Aarhus University,"Hiller, S (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",sanne.hiller@rub.de,,,,,,,46,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The tourism activity is proving to be a real support for the sustainable development of these areas, for the protection of their natural resources, as the degree of awareness with respect to their value and importance is increasingly higher locally, nationally and, sometimes, even regionally. However, the prerequisite for this support is the responsible behaviour of tourism consumers in protected natural areas. International scientific research in this field emphasizes two main trends. On the one hand there is a high degree of awareness with respect to the importance of developing and practising a form of sustainable tourism. However, on the other hand, the offer only partially reaches the level of the demand for sustainable tourism consumption. The main reason for this is the fact that travel agencies do not sufficiently know the potential demand for this type of tourism. The research performed within this article is meant to mitigate this disparity. This study is exploring the behaviour related to tourism consumption in protected areas, focussing on identifying the forms and especially the preference for tourism activities of the representatives of the demand. In the second semester of the 2013/2014 university year, complying with the principles of probabilities in the selection of subjects, 200 questionnaires were administered to the young population; 187 valid answers were obtained. The SPSS software was used for data processing and, as a result of the analysis performed on the survey results, the main characteristics of tourism consumption in protected areas have been identified.","[Hornoiu, Remus Ion; Padurean, Mihaela Ana; Nica, Ana-Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Maha, Liviu-George] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Hornoiu, RI (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",rhornoiu@yahoo.com,"Hornoiu, Remus Ion/HFA-6604-2022; Nica, Ana-Maria/IUQ-2106-2023; PADUREAN, ANA MIHAELA/AAY-5599-2020; Maha, Liviu-George/F-6014-2016","Nica, ANA-MARIA/0000-0002-5830-9428; Maha, Liviu-George/0000-0001-5937-6713; HORNOIU, REMUS ION/0000-0002-8509-4928; PADUREAN, ANA MIHAELA/0000-0002-6511-0185",,,,,18,8,9,1,39,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1178,1190,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900011,0

We show that the SEO long-run underperformance primarily occurs in young issuers. The intuition is that young firms generally have greater uncertainty about their future profitability due to greater intangible growth options. Therefore, when young firms finance investment from SEO proceeds, this uncertainty could be resolved because growth options are converted into assets in place, leading to a larger reduction in idiosyncratic risk than their matched non-issuers suggest. Furthermore, there is no evidence of post-issue stock underperformance and abnormal decline in idiosyncratic risk for mature issuers, supporting the growth option perspectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It finds evidence that FDI crowds out domestic investment in countries with entry regulation cost above a certain level, and many of these countries are in the bottom quartile of GDP per capita. Reforms in business start-up regulations can therefore play a critical role in enhancing the complementarity between foreign and domestic investment and thereby increase entrepreneurship and economic growth in low-income countries. The analysis takes into account other significant factors which affect domestic investment such as the cost of capital, government's economic growth track record, institutional quality, and market size.","Salisbury Univ, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Munemo, J (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",jxmunemo@salisbury.edu,,,,,,,23,11,16,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

In this paper, we assume that the consumer-friendly firm maximizes the weighted sum of its absolute profit and consumer surplus. We show that in the quantity competition, for the consumer-friendly firm, under-capacity is chosen when the extent of the importance of consumer surplus to the consumer-friendly firm is high relative to the degree of product differentiation, whereas over-capacity is chosen otherwise. Moreover, we find that in the price competition, the consumer-friendly firm chooses over-capacity when the extent of importance of consumer surplus to the consumer-friendly firm is high relative to the degree of product differentiation, whereas it chooses under-capacity otherwise. Furthermore, regardless of the extent of the importance of consumer surplus to the consumer-friendly firm and the degree of product differentiation, it is shown that in the quantity competition, the absolute profit-maximizing firm chooses over-capacity, whereas in the price competition, it chooses under-capacity.

We estimate a two-stage oligopoly model of product differentiation. The first stage estimates a model of endogenous market structure and the second stage corrects for market structure to examine the prices charged and capacity choices for child care centers. We find that the actions of same-type providers have a statistically significant impact on a provider's entry and pricing decisions but we fail to find evidence that the actions of other types have a significant impact. Nonprofit child care providers and Head Start centers do not appear to crowd out for-profit providers. Further, we find that for-profits and nonprofits respond differently to market characteristics generating spatial differences in the types of center available in a market. Our data suggest that for-profits are more likely to enter markets with higher percentages of economically disadvantaged students, but they primarily serve those who work, rather than live, in the market. The prevalence of disadvantaged students does not impact the entry decision of nonprofits leaving disadvantaged areas with relatively fewer non-profit options to serve residents. Policies to encourage for-profit daycare would likely lead centers to locate in markets where they can provide service for workers, whereas a policy to encourage nonprofit entry might be more effective in providing low cost care for nearby residents.

However, currently, the European tourism industry is facing a loss in competitiveness at the global level due to a reduction in its share in world tourism and lower average revenues, many regions being in decline and the geographical flows being redirected. Based on these aspects, the present study proposes an analysis from the New Economic Geography perspective, considering two EU countries, a developed one (France), but situated in a tourist sub-region with a declining share in the total international tourist arrivals (Western Europe) and a developing one (Romania), from a growing tourism sub-region (Central/Eastern Europe). Using a comparative analysis at regional level, with three categories of functions - a function of impact (economic, social, environmental), a function of stability and a function of convergence -combined into a matrix model, we achieved an integrated research on the contribution that tourism brings in the two countries in terms of development and regional convergence. Then, we proposed a classification of regions according to the tourism index (mature tourist destinations, less attractive or in the early stage), the conclusions of the paper outlining several action lines for improving competitiveness of tourism in developing regions.","[Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen; Tiganasu, Ramona] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Tiganasu, R (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",ramona.frunza@uaic.ro,"Tiganasu, Ramona/AAG-8631-2021; Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen/O-4976-2015","Tiganasu, Ramona/0000-0002-5921-7023; Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen/0000-0002-8169-0124",,,,,35,17,17,0,53,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1089,1109,,,,,,21,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900005,0

We find that venture capitalists achieve higher returns with lateral rather than synergetic trade sales, and that the difference is greater for deals involving early stage companies characterized by strong information asymmetries. In addition, horizontal trade sales yield higher returns than vertical trade sales; however, in boom phases of the venture capital market, this effect reverses.

However, previous authors have abstracted from two important concepts: ideology and intra-party politics. In this paper, we account for these two phenomena explicitly, and make two main contributions. First, we show that both intra- and inter-party ideological dispersion matter in explaining the level of sub-national public spending. Therefore, it is improper to consider parties as monolithic entities. We also show that ideological dispersion matters especially for current expenditures, and not so much for investment expenditures. To do so, we construct a panel database (2003-2010) comprising data from a survey that quantifies the policy preferences of party members who were candidates in Swiss elections.","[Bjedov, Tjasa; Lapointe, Simon; Madies, Thierry] Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Bjedov, Tjasa] Univ Lyon, CNRS GATE, F-69130 Ecully, France",University of Fribourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Madiès, T (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, Bd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",tjasa.bjedov@unifr.ch; simon.lapointe@unifr.ch; thierry.madies@unifr.ch,,"Madies, Thierry/0000-0002-8184-4306",,,,,57,6,7,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2014,161.0,1-2,,,,,209,232,,10.1007/s11127-013-0149-8,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AN4BK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340532400012,0

By testing interest rates, we also find some evidence of housing price bubbles. Our findings suggest that the central bank could have limited housing price bubbles if it had started to intervene in the housing market prior to 2003.

This paper reports on a nationwide study of the changes in car use in the 2000s, conducted in eleven large cities. This may assist us in filling the gaps in our existing knowledge, which is based on individual city cases. It is apparent that China's large cities are embracing a new era of the automobile at an unexpected speed and scale. However, at the same time, it seems that a 'peak' in car use has occurred in Shanghai and Beijing, as either the absolute number of Via per capita has dropped or its growth has slowed in these cities. The changes in urban mobility are deeply affected by social and economic transition factors. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the effects of increasing incomes and the growing middle class, changing lifestyles and the emerging consumer society, the appearance of the e-Society and an increasingly ageing society. In particular, the growing demand for car use by the younger generation (G2), women and elderly people for the purpose of social activity has become an important force behind the increase in overall VKT. The paper concludes with a discussion of current theoretical perspectives and the issues which should be addressed in future research on the social aspects of private motorised urban mobility in China.

However, since they involve subsidizing firms, the risk is that they could crowd out private investment, subsidizing activities that firms were planning to undertake anyway, or lead to pure private gains, rather than generating the public gains that justify government intervention. As a result, rigorous evaluation of the effects of such programs is important. We attempted to implement randomized experiments to evaluate the impact of seven matching grant programs offered in six African countries, but in each case we were unable to complete an experimental evaluation. One critique of development research is publication bias, whereby only interesting results get published. Our hope is to mitigate this bias by learning from the experiments that never happened. We describe the three main proximate reasons for lack of implementation: continued project delays, politicians not willing to allow random assignment, and low program take-up; and then delve into the underlying causes of these occurring. Political economy, overly stringent eligibility criteria that do not take account of where value-added may be highest, a lack of attention to detail in last mile issues, incentives facing project implementation staff, and the way impact evaluations are funded, and all help explain the failure of randomization.

We examine primary indicators of systemic risk as well as contributing factors that exacerbate vulnerability to systemic events. Evaluation of systemic risk is based on a detailed financial analysis of the insurance industry, its role in the economy, and the interconnectedness of insurers. The primary conclusion is that the core activities of U. S. insurers do not pose systemic risk. However, life insurers are vulnerable to intrasector crises, and both life and property-casualty insurers are vulnerable to reinsurance crises. Noncore activities such as financial guarantees and derivatives trading may cause systemic risk, and interconnectedness among financial institutions has grown significantly in recent years. To reduce systemic risk from noncore activities, regulators need to continue efforts to strengthen mechanisms for insurance group supervision.","[Cummins, J.

They are also an important group of stock owners. This paper explores the role of entrepreneurial risk in explaining time variation in expected U. S. stock returns in the period 1952-2010. It proposes an entrepreneurial distress factor that is based on a cointegrating relationship between aggregate consumption and income from proprietary and nonproprietary wealth. This factor, referred to here as the cpy residual, signals when entrepreneurial income is low in relation to aggregate consumption and other forms of income in the economy. It is highly correlated with cross-sectional measures of idiosyncratic entrepreneurial and default risk, and it has considerable forecasting power for the expected equity premium. However, the correlation between cpy and the stock market started to decline at the beginning of the 1980s. The decline in this correlation can be associated with increased stock market participation and with the progress of U. S. state-level bank deregulation. This pattern is consistent with the view that entrepreneurial risk became more easily diversifiable in the wake of U.

I derive accurate approximations of the ex ante probability distributions of proportional trading costs and portfolio turnover under the conventional assumption of normal asset returns. Based on these approximations, I express the expected trading costs as a function of asset and portfolio characteristics. All else equal, the expected trading costs increase with: i) the deviations of the expected asset returns from the expected portfolio return, ii) the assets' volatility and iii) the portfolio volatility. At the same time, they decrease with the covariance between the assets and the portfolio. Furthermore, I propose novel estimators of the expected turnover and trading costs and show that they offer small bias and low variance, even when the sample size is small. Finally, I incorporate my results into a portfolio selection framework to produce portfolios with low levels of risk and trading costs.

The interactions are framed to simulate real-world retail market competition. The participants compete in an effort task, with performance determining market returns. A highly incentivized individual round allows us to extract a measure of individual ability in the effort task. The subjects then compete in successive treatments, where in the final treatment the losing participant in a round can elect to burn their competitor's output, which is framed as the application of social pressure. The behavioural responses are significant and fitting with a theoretical model of the social institution we have in mind: even though subjects are from the same community they are willing to punish (apply social pressure), the probability of punishment is increasing in the gap in ability in the pair, and this leads to a decrease in performance from higher-ability individuals. The study provides an example of the use of framed lab experiments to shed light on market behaviour in developing countries, for which full-blown RCTs may face serious feasibility or ethical challenges.

S. property-casualty (P/C) insurers and presents the first detailed examination on the likely impact of major global reinsurer insolvency on the U. S. P/C insurance industry, in order to illustrate the potential systemic risk caused by the interconnectedness of the insurance sector through reinsurance. We find that the likelihood of a primary insurer's downgrade increases with its reinsurance default risk exposure from downgraded reinsurers. Counter-party primary insurers' stocks also react negatively to their reinsurers' downgrades. The negative effects also spill over to insurers that are not directly exposed to the credit risk of downgraded reinsurers. Despite the close interconnectedness, worst-case scenario analyses show that the likelihood of systemic risk caused by reinsurance transactions is relatively small for the U. S.

We bridge this gap by providing individual estimates for EIAs on world trade, while employing first-differencing techniques to correct for endogeneity bias and account for phase-in effects. Overall, EIAs promote trade by at most 50 %. Surprisingly, more than half of the EIAs investigated have had no discernible impact on trade at all, while only about one quarter of the agreements are trade promoting. Characteristics of these agreements, such as their institutional quality, design, and their members' involvement in the World Trade Organisation, shed more light on how this variation can be understood.","Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Kohl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",t.kohl@rug.nl,"Kohl, Tristan/I-7133-2019","Kohl, Tristan/0000-0003-1756-602X",,,,,68,83,90,3,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Yet, to this date, there is not a clear understanding of the consequences of enforcing E-Verify on likely unauthorized immigrants or on natives across the United States. This study aims to fill in that gap by analyzing the impact that the enactment of various types of E-Verify mandates may have on the employment and wages of these groups. We find that the enactment of employment verification mandates reduces the employment likelihood of likely unauthorized workers. Additionally, it raises the hourly wages of likely unauthorized women. None of these impacts are observed among a similarly skilled sample of naturalized Hispanic immigrants. Finally, the enactment of E-Verify mandates appears to raise the employment likelihood of alike non-Hispanic natives, while raising the hourly wage of native-born male employees, alluding to the potential substitutability of unauthorized immigrants and non-Hispanic natives.

First, our cross-country results show that the probability of suffering the crisis in 2008 was larger for countries having higher levels of credit deposit ratio whereas it was lower for countries characterized by higher levels of: (i) net interest margin, (ii) concentration in the banking sector, (iii) restrictions to bank activities, (iv) private monitoring. The bank-level analysis reinforces these results and shows that the latter factors are also key determinants across banks, thus explaining the probability of bank crisis.

When public education is financed by sectoral taxes, the education policy maximizing the growth rate differs from that obtained by the standard unisectoral tax. The reasons for this are twofold. First, because agents' preferences for services, human capital and savings become a major determinant of the relationship between growth and public education expenditure. Second, because education spending is a service and hence sectoral taxation creates a distortion by affecting its relative price. Finally, we reveal that a sectoral tax may perform better than a standard aggregate production tax in terms of long-term growth.","[Davin, Marion] Ctr Vieille Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Davin, Marion] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Davin, Marion] EHESS, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Davin, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Vieille Charite, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France.",marion.davin@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We show that mandatory immediate full annuitisation of retirement assets will reduce rational individuals' certainty equivalent pension wealth by up to 54%. Softening the strict immediate annuitisation requirements along the line of regulatory realities in some of the surveyed countries reduces utility losses considerably.

Historically, subunits innovated mainly to adapt for local conditions products or processes developed in the home country of the MNC parent company. Thus, subunit creative activity in new fields little explored earlier by their parent was driven mainly by their own local system of innovation. However, MNC subunits evolved over successive decades, increasingly gaining a more internationally integrated creative role. Hence, the availability of a wider array of knowledge through the international connectedness of firms in the relevant industry in the country in which the subunit is located, has gained in importance. Within this context, the role of the parent company in subunit creative activity has also become more important, since combining core company knowledge with new discoveries requires a closer integration of subunit creative activities with those of the MNC group. We provide evidence on these historical changes by analyzing a panel data set of innovative activities conducted abroad by 244 among the world's largest industrial firms, in 2276 foreign subunits, from 1940 to 1995.","[Cantwell, John] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Piscitello, Lucia] Politecn Milan, DIG, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Newark; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Piscitello, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, DIG, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",cantwell@business.rutgers.edu; lucia.piscitello@polimi.it,,"piscitello, lucia/0000-0002-4817-315X",,,,,79,23,23,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We combine these time series with standard sources to test competing theories of religious change. Although our attendance estimates affirm the prevalence of religious decline, our statistical tests offer no support for traditional theories of secularization (which link decline to changes in income, education, industrialization, urbanization, and family life). Nor can we attribute much of the observed decline to growth in the welfare state. But increased school spending by governments does reduce church attendance, and this effect is not the result of greater educational attainment.

In March 2012, the EPA announced a proposed carbon pollution standard for new power plants. Then in September 2013, the EPA withdrew the proposal upon issuing a revision as part of President Obama's Climate Action Plan. This article analyzes the stringency of the proposed emission standards for new electricity generating units relative to the emission rates of existing, recently constructed, and proposed units in the United States. No coal-fired units would come close to the emission targets unless there are future innovations in carbon capture and storage. While natural gas units designed to meet peak demand are effectively exempt, very few of them would comply on an annual basis. For the baseload natural gas units-that is, combined-cycle gas turbine units-we find that between 90 and 95 percent of the units that began operating in 2006 or later would already meet the proposed targets. Finally, we discuss differences among states regarding the characteristics of recently constructed and planned units as they relate to the proposed standards.","[Kotchen, Matthew J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Kotchen, Matthew J.] NBER, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Mansur, Erin T.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Mansur, Erin T.] NBER, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kotchen, MJ (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",matthew.kotchen@yale.edu; erin.mansur@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,17,7,9,1,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

We exploit a dataset of Italian Regions from 1984 to 2008, approximate the spread of information with the diffusion of newspapers, and estimate the effect of the news before and after 1995. In fact, in the mid-90s two reforms introduced the direct election of the governor, autonomous taxing powers and incentives for fiscal discipline at the regional level in Italy. We test the following hypotheses, derived from the theoretical literature: 1) the diffusion of newspapers affects public expenditures close to elections; 2) the more newspapers are diffused, the larger is the reduction of the electoral cycle; 3) before the reform were implemented, the diffusion of newspapers constrained the increased size of expenditures by reducing the positive variation of capital expenditures; 4) after the reform were implemented, the diffusion of newspapers leaves unaffected the size of expenditures by reducing both the positive variation of capital expenditures and the negative variation of current expenditures. The empirical analysis confirms the expectations; the results, moreover, are robust to alternative categorizations of the press and indicate a larger effectiveness of the diffusion of local press.

It is theoretically informed by the mobility biographies approach, and by gender/travel studies. The data used is the German Mobility Panel (GMP) 1994 to 2010 in which households and their members are asked three times in three subsequent years to report the trips they made over a week. The changes reported are regressed to key events over the life course, cohort effects and period effects, while sociodemographics and spatial context attributes are controlled. A cluster-robust regression approach is used to account for the non-independent character of panel observations. Significant effects were found for some key events, including the birth of a child, entry into the labour market, and changes in spatial context, accessibility and mobility. Some effects differed distinctly between men and women, suggesting that men and women are differently affected by life course events. However, taken together the associations found, as well as their gender differences are rather limited. Hence, key events over the life course seem to be only loosely associated with travel mode specific trip rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, these persistent expansions take place just before competitive elections, and are associated with lower future employment growth by firms in other regions.

We offer a model where politicians who vary in their level of competence compete by making costly campaign declarations. We show that a separating equilibrium exists in which the ambiguity of a candidate's campaign declaration reveals her level of competence.

Using categories drawn from convention theory, this system is characterized in terms of specific approaches to hiring, training and promotion; labour retention; work organization and worker deployment; payment systems and supervision, as well as to collective bargaining. In convention theory terms, the combination of approaches identified in Kenya embodies a mixture of 'industrial' and 'civic' orientations - in contrast to both more traditional paternalist and unbridled market-oriented ones. The material and political foundations of this 'industrial-civic compromise' are explored at length, with particular attention to stabilization of the production system (in the case of industrial elements) and political and demand-side developments (in the case of civic elements). The paper concludes by considering the generalizability of these findings to other large-scale agricultural sectors in developing countries.","[Riisgaard, Lone] Roskilde Univ, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Gibbon, Peter] Danish Inst Int Studies, DK-1401 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gibbon, Peter] Univ Manchester, DK-1401 Copenhagen, Denmark",Roskilde University; Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Riisgaard, L (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Univ Svej 1,POB 260, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",loner@ruc.dk; pgi@diis.dk,"Riisgaard, Lone/Y-4324-2018","Riisgaard, Lone/0000-0002-8827-3227",,,,,47,27,27,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We provide empirical support for this hypothesis using a measure of equity-based compensation that reflects the sensitivity of the top five executives' wealth (based on ownership of stock, options, and restricted shares) to a 1% change in stock price. We find that firms associated with high equity-based compensation for top executives experience abnormally low stock returns and relatively unfavorable changes in operating performance in the three-year period following the issue.

Several disciplines gather information on preferences through surveys by asking respondents to make hypothetical choices over potential policies. However the context of the choice question differs between approaches, with some failing to make the full consequences of the respondent's choice explicit in the question. In this study we investigate whether question context matters, by exploring whether economic and psychology approaches yield a similar understanding of community preferences towards a large-scale recycled wastewater scheme. We find that stated preferences differ depending on whether the preference question is contextualised using economic incentives. The findings provide insight into the implications of inappropriately contextualised preference questions, methodological considerations in attitude identification and estimation, and the diversity of values and public attitudes towards recycled wastewater.","[Gibson, Fiona L.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Burton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Gibson, FL (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",fiona.gibson@uwa.edu.au; michael.burton@uwa.edu.au,"burton, michael/A-9541-2009","burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; Dempster, Fiona/0000-0002-7989-3483",,,,,56,23,25,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Rather than concentrating low income households in designated developments, vouchers allow families to choose their housing units and neighborhoods. In this project we explore whether low income households use the flexibility provided by vouchers to reach neighborhoods with high performing schools. Unlike previous experimental work, which has focused on a small sample of voucher holders constrained to live in low-poverty neighborhoods, we look at the voucher population as a whole and explore the broad range of neighborhoods in which they live. Relying on internal data from HUD on the location of assisted households, we link each voucher holder in the country to the closest elementary school within their school district. We compare the characteristics of the schools that voucher holders are likely to attend to the characteristics of those accessible to other households receiving place based housing subsidies, other similar unsubsidized households and fair market rent units within the same state and metropolitan area. These comparisons provide us with a portrait of the schools that children might have attended absent HUD assistance. In comparison to other poor households in the same metropolitan areas, we find that the schools near voucher holders have lower performing students than the schools near other poor households without a housing subsidy. We probe this surprising finding by exploring whether differences between the demographic characteristics of voucher holders and other poor households explain the differences in the characteristics of nearby schools, and whether school characteristics vary with length of time in the voucher program. We also examine variation across metropolitan areas in the relative quality of schools near to voucher holders and whether this variation is explained by economic, socio-demographic or policy differences across cities.

We propose that the size of firms affects the scale and quality of product innovation through the adoption of different decision-making styles. Using the literature on cognition, we conceptualize decision-making style as the degree to which firms rely on analytical information for decision making during the R&D process. Using longitudinal data of Spanish firms, we show that, as firms increase in size, they rely more extensively on analytical decision tools for the innovation activity. Additionally, we show that the size of firms is negatively related to product innovation productivity in terms of scale and positively related to the quality, and that these relationships are mediated by firms' reliance on analytical decision-making style.

The first factor concerns proximity to medical services. The second factor is state-specific health care policy that may impede access to nearby medical services. Four key findings are obtained. First, the effect of local doctors on reducing mortality rates of various diseases in a county attenuates with distance. Second, at approximately the same distance, in-state doctors contribute more to lowering mortality rates in the primary county than do out-of-state doctors. Third, the lesser impact of nearby out-of-state doctors is further reduced when the primary state adopts more stringent policies that restrict entry of out-of-state physicians. Fourth, the impact of nearby doctors is found to be stronger in more urbanized areas. This is consistent with agglomeration economies being effective in contributing, at least in part, to the productivity of treating patients. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Second, remittance and aid inflows dampen the effect of positive food price shock and food price instability on household consumption in vulnerable countries. Third, negative food price shock episodes are associated with a significant increase in household consumption in vulnerable countries. Fourth, a lower remittance-to-GDP ratio is required in order to fully absorb the effects of food price shocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from the tenth wave of the Survey on Manufacturing Firms conducted by Unicredit-Capitalia, it was found that, compared with domestic firms, firms relocating activities to a foreign country have different characteristics, and better firms might self-select into offshoring decision. To disentangle the effect of offshoring on firms' performances from the effect of firm characteristics, several variants of propensity score matching are used.

In this paper we analyze the effect of authority behavior on the burden of complying with tax regulations. Using survey data of Belgian businesses, we develop an estimation strategy to overcome simultaneity bias by the construction of proxy variables. According to our estimate, a customer-unfriendly tax administration increases the average compliance burden by about 27%. Our outcome has interesting implications for further research. First of all, authority behavior does not only affect soft tax compliance factors like fairness and trust, but also hard aspects like costs. Second, the distribution of administrative cost burdens between the taxpayer side and the authorities may be important regarding the cost-efficiency of the tax system as a whole.

One novelty is the combined analysis of back auditing and ageing, which allows for incorporating psychological findings with respect to social norm updating over a taxpayer's life cycle. Another novelty concerns individual's social behavior regarding a Pareto-optimal provision of public goods. Simulation results support the counterintuitive conclusion drawn elsewhere in the literature that income tax compliance may decrease with raising marginal per capita returns (MPCRs). Yet, back auditing seems to have by far the strongest impact on the dynamics of fiscal fraud and also can help to curb the extent of tax evasion (ETE). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Data collection and processing has resulted in the filling of a 14 queries questionnaire by each of the 560 consumers in the South-Western Oltenia region and, subsequently, in data analysis. The main findings show that consumers have experienced a decline in what concerns their standard of living and that sustainable consumption of goods was barely stimulated.

With Scottish Government backing, the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) has started to construct a tram network to cater for the future needs of Scotland's capital city by providing an integrated transport solution using trams and buses. Spatial Network Analysis of Public Transport Accessibility (SNAPTA) which is a GIS-based accessibility model has been developed to measure the accessibility by public transport to different urban services and activities. The model responds to several limitations in other existing accessibility models in planning practice. It offers an alternative and practical tool to help planners and decision makers in examining the strengths and weaknesses of land use - transport integration. SNAPTA has been applied to a pilot study in Edinburgh city to identify the contribution of the infrastructure improvements of the tram system and Edinburgh South Suburban Railway (ESSR) to improved accessibility by public transport to six types of activity opportunities. This paper outlines the concept and methodology of the SNAPTA model, and presents the findings related to this pilot study with a focus on changes in potential accessibility to jobs between four different public transport network scenarios. The accessibility values so obtained help to identify the gaps in the coverage of the public transport network and the efficiency in the spatial distribution of urban services and activities. The findings focus on whether the planned transport infrastructures for Edinburgh will lead to better accessibility and reduced inequity (in terms of accessibility) across the city.

Scientists play a major role in achieving this goal, as research methods, techniques and tools have continuously evolved. In the last two decades, the development of these instruments has seen an important boost, as neuromarketing methods and techniques added depth and accuracy to traditional studies. The main aim of this paper is to highlight the role and importance of neuromarketing research techniques in the evolution of neurosciences and to explain how these techniques are used in market research. One of the most important challenges for companies who offer neuromarketing services is to stick to ethical principles when performing the investigations. This is an obligation they have both towards the beneficiaries - the companies providing products or services - and towards their consumers as well. This challenge has always been a subject of dispute between the advocates and critics of neuromarketing. Thus, this paper deals with this and other controversial topics. It starts with analysing a traditional persuasion model that has inherently been influenced by the neuromarketing research features. Then, it addresses the positive and negative aspects that subjects might have to face throughout neuromarketing studies, always bearing in mind the current Ethical Code of Conduct issued by the Neuromarketing Science and Business Association (NMSBA). An exploratory online research helped the authors test several hypotheses on ethical issues that neuromarketing companies have to handle. The research was performed on 67 neuromarketing companies from around the world that are members of the NMSBA. The findings are relevant both to researchers and neuromarketing companies, even the Romanian ones, who can use them used as insights.","[Pop, Nicolae Al.; Iorga, Ana Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Dabija, Dan-Cristian] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Dabija, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristian.dabija@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Dabija, Dan-Cristian/I-8101-2012; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/L-9045-2016","Dabija, Dan-Cristian/0000-0002-8265-175X; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/0000-0003-4565-4879",,,,,69,34,36,1,110,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,26,40,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300003,0

It measures over-indebtedness as a subjective indicator based on loan-related sacrifices that borrowers report. It finds that male microborrowers are more likely to be over-indebted. So are borrowers with adverse economic shocks, low returns on investment, and non-productive loan use. Over-indebtedness is lower for borrowers with good debt-literacy. General financial literacy and numeracy seem insufficient to reduce over-indebtedness. The paper details the relationship of the above factors to the specific sacrifices borrowers make and suggests that policy measures address the full complexity of the over-indebtedness phenomenon.

Although a significant amount of research has explored the patterns of FDI, little work has been done to assess what influences the value of cross-border mergers and, in particular, what determines why some cross-border mergers are expected to result in higher synergies when compared to others. This paper explores what characteristics of a merger are expected to increase the synergies that a firm will accrue from a cross-border merger by testing how a variety of factors impact the premia paid to effectuate a cross-border merger. We find that firms are willing to pay a higher premium to obtain greater control over foreign firms, and that this control is even more important in mergers involving firms in emerging markets. We also find that the factors affecting deal premia in cross-border mergers differ based on whether the acquirer has a high or low intangible asset intensity level.","[Sonenshine, Ralph; Reynolds, Kara] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Sonenshine, R (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",Sonenshi@american.edu; reynolds@american.edu,,"Reynolds, Kara/0000-0002-2570-4384; Sonenshine, Ralph/0000-0002-9923-4450",,,,,30,11,14,3,60,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

To examine the capacity of the agriculture sector to act as a buffer in the presence of a negative external shock to the Free State provincial economy, two different shocks are considered: an increase in the international oil price together with a decrease in the international gold price and a devaluation of South African currency. In these simulations, the agricultural sector does not play a buffer role of absorbing labour displaced from other sectors. Our hypothesis was that in the presence of a negative external shock, the agricultural sector would be able to absorb, to some extent, the negative impact, especially labour. The argument is that when the rest of the economy suffers a slowdown, people will migrate back to agriculture and therefore the agricultural sector will grow and increase its labour demand, alleviating the impacts of the crisis. To analyse the impact of the agriculture sector on welfare and income distribution, an increase in agricultural production, industrial production and other sectors is simulated through increased labour productivity. The results suggest that the agricultural sector plays a significant role in reducing poverty and improving income distribution, but considering poverty the results suggest that the manufacturing sector increases income more than other sectors. Our hypothesis is that growth based on agriculture has a greater impact on poor income households than industrial-based growth. The assumption behind this is that more poor households rely on agriculture than on other sectors.","[Bahta, Y. T.; Willemse, B.

Humans who are ruled by their passions, opinionated or vain, aggressive or revengeful, but also self-sacrificing, magnanimous or generous. Out of the above mentioned attitudes the paper focuses on a subtype of altruism: on the so-called reciprocal altruism. This kind of motivations, directing the economic actions, is widely discussed in the literature, but among the uncountable articles only a very few focus on the specific types of reciprocal altruism, developed in the post-socialist countries. As economic life becomes more and more complex and uncertainty burgeons in these countries, the significance of the clearing system of favors, e.g. networks based on reciprocal altruism increases. The goal of the author is to enlighten the nature and the forms of this type of altruism. The author's main finding is that network trust, tied into the system of market economy selfishness, is not only capable of strengthening individuals' will to run risks, but lead to an unmistakable decrease of costs in market transactions. As the impersonal (and legally guaranteed) mechanisms to secure the fulfillment of contracts are not well-developed enough, the post-socialist economies could not function without reciprocal altruism at all. Another important finding of the paper is, that the unique and as yet irreplaceable role of reciprocal altruism in the Central and Eastern European economies is to bridge over the gap between two contrasting characteristics of the post-socialist economies: the high risks in the new markets and the risk-averting behavior of the market actors. The risk-sharing networks based on specific forms of reciprocal altruism strengthen the people's inclination to take risks under circumstances where real risks are extremely high as a consequence of underdeveloped institutional framework.",,,,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,219,229,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200016,0

In DCEs, individuals are assumed to hold rational preferences, but many empirical studies report evidence of preferences that violate this foundation. This may be the result of several factors, including problems in the design and implementation of the DCEs questionnaires. This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of using qualitative research methodologies in the design of complete and accurate DCEs questionnaires in the domain of renewable energy sources (RES).

Then the financial crisis erupted and pushed them into deep recessions, raising their deficits and debt levels. By 2010, they were facing severe debt problems. Spreads increased and, surprisingly, so did the share of the debt held by domestic creditors. Credit was reallocated from the private sector to the public sector, reducing investment and deepening the recessions even further. To account for these facts, we propose a simple model of sovereign risk in which debt can be traded in secondary markets. The model has two key ingredients: creditor discrimination and crowding-out effects. Creditor discrimination arises because, in turbulent times, sovereign debt offers a higher expected return to domestic creditors than to foreign ones. This provides incentives for domestic purchases of debt. Crowding-out effects arise because private borrowing is limited by financial frictions. This implies that domestic debt purchases displace productive investment. The model shows that these purchases reduce growth and welfare, and may lead to self-fulfilling crises. It also shows how crowding-out effects can be transmitted to other countries in the euro zone, and how they may be addressed by policies at the European level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, strengthening the role of the state in the economy, which is driven by a major economic crisis in the late twenties to thirties of the last century, and continued with the completion of the Second World War led to a significantly more active role of state ownership in many economies. In the late seventies state enterprises began to fade in importance due primarily to overcome the perception of their inefficiency. It has been listed perception and source of many of the privatization process which culminated at the beginning of the transition. Privatization process, which took place in Croatia back the last two decades through the transformation and privatization, was very complex due to the fact that it took place in transitional and war environment, and today, two decades since the beginning of the privatization private sector share in GDP of the Republic of Croatia is still too small with a large number of enterprises that have remained in state ownership. It is clear that due to political and economic reasons huge progress in the privatisation process in Croatia cannot be expected soon and therefore it is necessary to ensure efficient management of the whole state portfolio.

This study uses Taiwan's promulgation of Statements on Auditing Standards No. 33 to examine an important component of this challenge: the need for local standard setters to anticipate how domestic constituents would interpret local words used to translate original English terms. Data collected from samples of Taiwanese auditors, public prosecutors, and investors revealed that as compared to the auditors, financial statement users ascribe different connotative meanings to a Chinese term that was originally proposed, and one that was chosen as its replacement after objections from the accounting profession. Further, the words' connotative meanings significantly mediated the link between the local term and financial statement users' judgments about auditor legal liability. Significantly, the connotative meaning that financial statement users ascribed to the replacement term was associated with a higher level of ascribed auditor liability, such that in successfully pushing for a wording change, members of Taiwan's accounting profession may have increased, rather than reduced, their exposure to liability from audited financial statements. These findings have a number of implications for standard setters, the standard setting process, and accounting firms.","[Duh, Rong-Ruey] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Accounting, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Lin, Hsiao-Lun] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Accountancy, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taipei University,"Duh, RR (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Accounting, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",rrduh@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,52,3,3,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Essentially, the conversion feature of coco bonds would replace supervisory discretion about banks' capital adequacy with rules specifying when new equity was required. Academics and regulators conjectured that including sufficient cocos in a bank's capital structure could substantially insulate taxpayers from private investment losses. This potential fostered a literature evaluating the effect of cocos on bank and financial sector stability, risk-taking incentives, and corporate governance. I review this literature and suggest that regulatory capital definitions should be expanded to include substantial amounts of carefully designed coco bonds as a partial substitute for common equity in regulatory capital requirements.","Univ Florida, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Flannery, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",flannery@ufl.edu,,,,,,,50,33,39,1,21,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4806-9,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

I use the second HJD as it is important to take account of pricing errors over possible contingent claims when considering benchmark models that are used in fund performance applications (Wang & Zhang, 2012). I find that all of the candidate benchmark models are misspecified. I find that conditional multifactor models provide significant lower second HJD compared to the unconditional factor models. I find that there is nothing to be gained in terms of significant lower second HJD in using the index-based models compared to the conditional Carhart model.

The purpose of this paper is to identify current and future directions for research of economic modelling of sustainable corporate performance and reporting, which include environmental indicators (measuring the environmental impact on resources), social indicators (health and safety, human rights, ethical behavior etc.), corporate governance indicators (related to efficiency, structure and responsibilities of the governance) and the economic value of the company, where is considered combination of Sustainable Value Added, Economic Value Added and Data Envelopment Analysis methods. The solution is to analyze the possibilities of the method of artificial intelligence, when you build a descriptive model of a decision support system, aimed at simplifying the decision process.

This is a surveillance study, using an explanatory approach at two local governments in North Sumatra, Medan City and Binjai City Government. The results of this study show that the dominant factor as indicators of entrepreneurship barriers in the city of Binjai is the lack of entrepreneurial expertise while the indicators in Medan city is the adversity to start new business. Whereas, the dominant indicator that determines the value of both entrepreneurial intentions in the city of Medan and Binjai is a perceived feasibility to become entrepreneurs. The effect of barriers towards entrepreneurial intentions for the workforce is positive, which means the higher resistance value, the higher the entrepreneurial intention of the community for entrepreneurship. So, a reference model for community empowerment to improve entrepreneurship intention is the social capital development based on the dimensions of cooperation. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Today, the European Union is consequently faced with a dual problem: the scarcity of new and consequently young farmers and the rapid ageing of the farmer population. Young farmers can bring new skills and energy, and a more professional management to the farming sector. Against the context of an ageing agricultural labour force, the future of the farmers' profession must be ensured. Thus, European Unions' Common Agricultural Policy pays particular attention to the decline in young farmers, having established different policy measures and motives for new entrants in agriculture. Support to the setting up of young farmers includes support to facilitate the initial establishment and the structural adjustment of their holding afterwards. This paper attempts to identify Greek new farmers' perceptions about their participation in this policy measurement. For this reason a questionnaire was developed and distributed among young farmers participating in the measure 112 'Setting up of young farmers' (Common Agricultural Policy, Pillar II), in order to explore their expectations, perceptions and their daily practices in the field. The survey took place in different regions in Greece during an educational course series designed for new farmers. In total 254 new farmers answered questions concerning economic, environmental and cultivation practices. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Due to limited available data in China, my study was to investigate whether there were bubble in construction costs (including land price, costs of material and labour etc.) in Chinese cities. The answer to this question could reflect whether there were bubbles in land transactions to some extent. My study was based on two steps. Firstly, I examined whether the series of construction costs are stationary series by using Breitung test and Fisher-type test. These tests provide direct insight into whether there are bubbles in construction costs. Secondly, I studied the relationship between construction costs and incomes in Chinese cities by using random-effects GLS regression, fixed-effects (within) regression and AMG (augmented mean group estimation) method. By comparing these results of these analyses, I discovered that there are no bubbles in construction costs in Chinese cities. This result can indirectly imply that there are no bubbles in land prices in China. Another key contribution of mine is that I tried to use AMG based on panel data with limited time periods, which have not been used to detect bubbles in China before.","[Kuang, Rui-hu] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Kuang, Ju-chi] Foshan Univ, Foshan 528000, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of New South Wales Sydney; Foshan University,"Kuang, RH (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",r.kuang@student.unsw.edu.au; kjc2277@163.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-188-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,200,206,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3SZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351923900034,0

We found a significant reduction in cash dividends before and after the reform. Importantly, the reduction in cash dividends is significantly related to the reduction in the largest shareholder's ownership; however, it is not associated with the decline in non-publicly tradable shares. These results suggest that Chinese controlling shareholders' preference for cash dividends is attributable to the inherent illiquidity of their shares rather than non-tradability of shares.

For some, the competition law remedies and in particular the discount remedy that was adopted, following confirmation by the Competition Tribunal, constitutes a key measure of success for the case(s). This paper evaluates this claim by examining the design and effectiveness of the discount remedy, from a comparative perspective. We find that the period before, during and after the Pioneer Foods discount remedy, was characterised by increasing wheat prices. The discount remedy induced responses from Pioneer Foods' main competitors resulting in even wider gains for consumers than Pioneer Foods' own price reduction commitment.","[Mncube, Liberty] Univ Johannesburg, Competit Commiss South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Mncube, L (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Ctr Competit Econ, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,"Mncube, Liberty Macebo/0000-0003-0410-7764",,,,,10,1,1,0,4,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2014,53.0,1,,,,,26,45,,10.1080/03031853.2014.887904,0.0,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AB9DZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332091600002,0

One problem companies in industry are facing nowadays is the heterogeneous customer portfolio structure and the fact, that customer equity (CE) calculation models are referring to a company's turnover and are not profit oriented. Thus, a customer (that can be an organization, company or an individual) providing the selling company with a big turnover is more or less of greater value than a customer delivering a minor turnover. This may lead to mismanagement and wrong budget decisions. Therefore CE is a key indicator for a company's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) environment. In this paper, first the customer equity will be explained with its monetary and non-monetary dimensions. Secondly a new and applicable model will be introduced and discussed before starting with solving the problem of a heterogeneous customer portfolio, which is very important for companies dealing with a multi-level key market (e.g. lighting industry). The outcome of this paper is a network based CE calculation model, which is dynamic and can be used for different network structures - not only in an industrial environment.","[Moritz, Markus] SY Syst Technol Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany; [Keppler, Sonja] Cyprus Int Univ, Nicosia, Cyprus",Cyprus International University,,sonja.keppler@eu-edu.ch,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,275,284,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000019,0

Celebrities are hired because they are perceived to be more credible endorser of products compared to non-celebrities. Increasingly, celebrities start to engage in business not just as endorsers but also with a financial stake and decision-making role in the business. Despite being extensively reported in popular media, the role of celebrity entrepreneur-cum-endorser in advertising effectiveness literature is almost ignored. To address this gap, this study is undertaken to develop, test and validate a model that could explain the effects of celebrity entrepreneur endorsement on advertising effectiveness. The research hypothesizes that celebrity credibility (comprising of attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise) and advertisement credibility will positively affect three traditional measures of advertising effectiveness - attitude toward the advertisement, attitude toward the brand and purchase intention. A self-administered questionnaire with a stimulus advertisement featuring Dato' Siti Nurhaliza as the endorser of her own skincare label, SimplySiti, was filled up by 542 female respondents. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The findings revealed that both, celebrity credibility and advertisement credibility had positive impact on attitude toward the advertisement and attitude toward the brand. Moreover, the impact of consumers' perceived credibility on purchase intention was mediated by their attitudes Theoretical and managerial implications, as well as future research directions are suggested.

Access to financial services has allowed many low-income families to make significant progress in their own efforts to escape poverty. The government supports the growth of MFI services through many instruments, such as regulations, subsidy, and directed credit policies. Currently, there are two broad classification of microfince institutions in Indonesia, i.e., bank-MFIs such as BM's Unit Desas and rural banks (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat-BPR), and non-bank MFIs such as credit cooperatives (Koperasi), Islamic microfinance (such as Baitul Maal wat Tamwil, BMT), rotary-club saving (arisan), etc. As a business unit, the MFIs must follow the principle of efficiency to survive. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of one type of the MFI in Indonesia, namely Syariahrural banks (BPR-S). The common approach to measure the level of efficiency of a business unit used by management is financial approach, such as ratio of operating expenses to operating income. However, economists normally use production function approach or its derivation to measure the efficiency. We are comparing the two approaches to evaluate the efficiency levels of the BPR-S. The results show that the efficiency levels of the BPR-S are generally operating in a good efficiency. Efficiently ratios of BPR-S during the sample period of time have been mostly above 90%. The efficiency based on the financial ratios confirms the finding from the production function approach. (C) 2013 The Authors.

This is largely due to a lack of data, something I overcome using recent surveys of microenterprises in Mexico. After instrumenting for individual firm-level incidence, I find that thieves are much more harmful to microenterprises than officials. The incidence of robbery and extortion is associated with declines in income and employees, while the incidence of bribery and fines are associated with increases in both.

When rail disruptions unexpectedly occur, re-establishing network connectivity is paramount and the provision of bus bridging (or bus replacement service) is common. Minimising response times are critical in reducing impacts to affected commuters. Currently, reserve buses for such purposes are usually sourced from existing bus depot locations, which are generally situated to suit regular day to day operations. Strategically locating satellite bus reserves according to criteria such as disruption likelihood provides the opportunity to better cater for disrupted demand. The method is presented and analysis highlights how ideal depot locations within the network changes as consideration is given to travel time to locations where bus bridging commences, likelihood of a disruption warranting bus bridging and commuter volumes affected.

Focusing on China, we exploit a research setting where politicians are rewarded for capital market development, firms rely on political connections for access to capital, rent-seeking behavior is rampant, and the objectives of the state might not be to maximize capital market efficiency. We find that the rate of exchange eligible firms engaging in an IPO temporarily increases in advance of impending political promotion events. This effect holds for both state-owned and non-state-owned entities. For state-owned firms, the effect is strongest in those provinces where the politicians are more likely to be rewarded for market development activity. For non-state-owned firms, the temporary increase in IPO activity appears to be (rationally) opportunistic in nature, with the effect stronger around events more likely to disrupt the firms' political connections. Promotion period IPOs underperform non-promotion period IPOs in terms of both future financial performance and long-run stock returns, have controlling shareholders who retain a larger fraction of the company, and are more likely to divert proceeds away from their intended use after the offering.

Currently, companies have no motivation to protect intellectual property because they have enough experience in order to handle the entire process themselves. Commercialization of innovations into protectical use does not currently exist without the protection of intellectual property. Innovative activity is related to the definition of innovation process. Innovation performance follows the innovative activities of the company but as innovation activity it is not the property of the company. It is the result of the innovation process and arises from interactions among competing firms in a given market situation. Innovation performance (implementation of innovation) stands up to the very end of the innovation process. For measurement it is necessary to understand and describe the whole innovation process and to identify factors that may affect the ultimate realization of innovation. Innovation performance is generally considered as a crucial component of long-term competitiveness of countries and regions.

From the primary research it may be inferred that measurement of innovative performance can have high impact on the speed of adaptability of companies to changes and development.

However, recently there is new evidence that the properties of the normal densities are no more accurate for dealing with stylized facts such as the return time series of financial assets which deviate obviously from the normal shape. In order to overcome the misleading inferences of the normal density when assessing the market risk, we have to take into account the higher moments (higher order than the variance) of the returns' distributions. According to basic finance theory, investors are looking for stability and mean return (asymmetry) and trying to avoid return's variance (kurtosis). In this context, we try to make risky measures more robust. So we implemented a new measure of risk based on four moments of the return time series and also accounts for the existence of extreme events. The purpose of this work is to test the accuracy of this new multi-moments risky measure on the French financial market especially in the period of crises.

Agriculture operates within complex systems and is multifunctional in its nature. The concept of multifunctional agriculture emerged in the last decade of the twentieth century in developed countries where the economic importance of agriculture was negligible, and the community was increasingly concerned with the quality of consumed food and the surrounding environment. Within multifunctional agriculture, the different functions can be categorized into five colour categories. Firstly, the white functions represent a contribution to food security and food safety. Secondly, green functions represent a contribution to nature, the environment and landscape. Water management by farmers and the harnessing of energy on farms are categorized as blue and red functions, respectively. The yellow functions, which have a more social focus. The final category is the social farming belongs to the group of yellow functions. It is one of the fields of multifunctional agriculture. Multifunctional agriculture is a relatively new concept in the CEE countries, especially in Bulgaria. Empirical findings show that the notion of multifuncionality is rarely used in Bulgaria. The government of the country does not implement the concept of multifuncionality in the National Plan for Rural development but use relative concepts such as economic diversification, rural development or alternative activities. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and assess the status of multifunctional agriculture and its yellow function in Bulgaria using two cases of studies and on the basis of farmers' attitude towards the development of such activities as well as proposals or ways to establish a National Competence Center.

Drawing upon a sample of 132 male and female managers in Greek firms, a structured questionnaire was developed adopting the Competing Values Framework (CVE) in order to measure both leadership roles' competencies and managerial effectiveness. Results revealed that managers characterized by high levels of job performance excel in practicing all leadership competencies, while gender does not exert significant impact. A similar pattern emerged for managerial effectiveness profiles. Moreover, leadership competencies associated with the innovator, director and mentor roles found to contribute most to managerial effectiveness, thus specific directions for managerial action has been derived.

Many studies have found that different tasks may generate substantially different preferences. However, little is known about whether one task is more susceptible to preference reversals than another. Therefore, taking the preference reversals as a robust behavioral pattern, guidelines are called for to provide directions regarding a preferred preference elicitation task. This paper puts forward a new test of the internal consistency of choice and matching tasks, based on internal preference reversals.

To this end, a treatment effects model with time-varying parameters is estimated for 13 emerging economies from January 1986 to December 2008. Empirical results show that there is a greater efficiency in recent years and that financial liberalization not only improves the degree of efficiency but also reduces the probability of financial crises. They also suggest that improving efficiency depends upon several internal characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper suggests a practical way for determining the discount rate for projects or programmes in which one of the options is to maintain or restore land to an undeveloped state. We propose an equivalency principle to derive a simple rule that sets the discount rate. The rule is based on the premise that the long term value of a piece of undeveloped land ought to be at least the same as the value of an identical piece of land in the vicinity to which permission has been granted for development. We illustrate this principle with various case studies and we apply it to a contentious investment project in the Basque Country associated with the regeneration of a large scale harbour that involves reclaiming undeveloped land that has important ecological values, including for the conservation of a marine ecosystem.","[Chiabai, Aline; Galarraga, Ibon; Markandya, Anil; Pascual, Unai] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao 48008, Spain; [Markandya, Anil; Pascual, Unai] Basque Fdn Sci, IKERBASQUE, Bilbao, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Basque Foundation for Science; University of Cambridge,"Chiabai, A (通讯作者)，Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Alameda Urquijo 4,4-1A, Bilbao 48008, Spain.",aline.chiabai@bc3research.org,"CHIABAI, ALINE/M-7447-2013; Pascual, Unai/O-7946-2019; Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013; Markandya, Anil/K-9381-2013","Pascual, Unai/0000-0002-5696-236X; Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094; Chiabai, Aline/0000-0002-0792-640X",,,,,54,6,6,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Our results do not appear to be explained by long-term investor self-selection, monitoring (corporate governance), or concentration (blockholdings).

This article reviews the experience up to 2012, examines BI's performance in hitting its inflation targets and considers certain broader indicators of success. Overall, inflation targeting in Indonesia has been a messy, evolutionary process, and BI's implementation record compares unfavourably with that of its peers. Yet Indonesia recorded a significant downward trend in inflation during this period and maintained strong economic growth. Also, almost all of its inflation-targeting arrangements are now in line with common international practice.

This model shows that if a university seeks to act as a complement to private-sector collaborative R&D so that it will be attractive to both incumbent firms and startup entrepreneurs, it needs to structure its program so that business enterprise revenues increase and business enterprise R&D costs rise by a smaller proportion than revenues increase, if they rise at all (and a fall would be better). Such a structure is consistent with both business enterprise and university interests, but is only likely to be feasible if the university is subsidized to cover the cost of such public-private collaborative research partnerships. In the absence of such support, the university will have to cover its costs through a fee charged to participating business enterprises and that will result in the university being seen as a substitute rather than a complement to private-sector collaborative R&D, and thus the university will be seen as an unattractive partner for many business enterprises.","[Leyden, Dennis Patrick; Link, Albert N.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Link, AN (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",dpleyden@uncg.edu; anlink@uncg.edu,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022",,,,,,70,43,47,2,128,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Contrary to previous studies on this issue based on average effects (mostly considering ordinary least squares estimations), we follow a quantile regression approach that enables us to capture heterogeneous effects of trust for different development levels. By considering data for 80 countries, and using trust indicators from five different waves of the World Values Survey (WVS), our results by quantile indicate that trust is not relevant for the poorest economies, showing the existence of a social poverty trap. In addition, results suggest that the impact of trust on income decreases as an economy becomes richer. This would suggest not only that trust benefits cannot be generalized for all countries, as some previous studies have proposed, but also that the extent of its implications are heavily dependent on the level of development.

In a context of hub classification, determining the contribution of each airport to the national network in terms of the two dimensions of hubbing -i.e., traffic generation and connectivity- is a key aspect. In this regard, the choice of an appropriate connectivity indicator is still an unresolved issue. This paper adapts the well-known flow centrality indicator to an air transport context and develops a novel measure of airport connectivity. An application to the US domestic network is provided, using quarterly data on passenger demand to perform a detailed time-series analysis of airport connectivity patterns between 1993 and 2012. The flow centrality indicator is then used to define an alternative airport classification method within the context of the Federal Aviation Administration's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIASs). Results show that there is potential for improving the existing airport typology by explicitly separating connectivity and traffic generation as classification criteria. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This dimension of early historical development has not been considered so far in studies that analyze the determinants of financial development. The estimation allows for all major theories established in the literature as possible explanations for the disparity of financial development across the globe. Significance of state antiquity is robust to the use of alternative indicators of financial development, the consideration of different lengths and periods of statehood, and controlling for a range of variables or country characteristics. Our results highlight the important role of statehood in propelling financial system development, and thus provide some support to the view that historically determined differences in the early-start developmental advantage provide the basis for explaining the fundamental sources of variations in financial development between countries today.

Theory predicts that, because of portfolio rebalancing, a negative shock in one market transmits itself to the others, as investors adjust their portfolio allocations. The theory is supported by the experimental results. The price observed in the laboratory is close to that predicted by theory, and strong contagion effects are observed. The results are robust across different market structures.

Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) are considered to be the key RES-E policy tool to date. This article tackles the question on why some state legislators were front-running the trend of RPS implementation whereas others adopted policies just recently, and why others have not adopted them at all. We compile data on financial contributions of conventional energy interest groups (CEI) and renewable energy interest groups (REI) to state-level policy-makers between 1998 and 2010. By means of hazard and tobit regressions, we test the effect of these financial contributions on the probability of RPS adoption and on RPS stringency. The article provides evidence in favor of interest group theory. First, CEI have donated more to state-level legislators affiliated with the Republican Party than to Democrats while contributions from REI went largely to the latter. Second, there are statistically significant links between the likelihood of RPS adoption and private interest contributions. Contributions from CEI have a negative effect on the likelihood of RPS adoption whereas REI contributions have a positive effect.","[Jenner, Steffen] Univ Tubingen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Ovaere, Lotte] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium; [Schindele, Stephan] Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energy Syst, Aachen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; KU Leuven; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Jenner, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Melanchthonstr 36, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",Steffen.Jenner@uni-tuebingen.de,,"Schindele, Stephan/0000-0001-9863-739X",,,,,31,7,11,0,17,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

This awareness is observed in most countries all over the world, nevertheless certain differences can be noticed between the developed and developing states. Although the concept of sustainable consumption is being actively promoted among consumers in the developing countries (e. g. in Poland), they are still less aware of the necessity to conform to socio-ecological norms in the process of consumption. The main aim of the article is to analyse buyer behaviour in the context of sustainable development policy pursued in Poland. The first part will be devoted to theoretical issues relating to the subject of the analysis. In the second part of the paper the author will present the results of a survey examining the aforementioned behaviour.","Univ Szczecin, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Korpysa, J (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland.",jarek@korpysa.pl,"Korpysa, Jaroslaw/AAL-8369-2020","Korpysa, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-2400-3308",,,,,15,2,2,0,26,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2013,15.0,,,,7,,702,713,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,268IU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328164400011,0

Because failing to redevelop brownfields may negatively affect welfare and the environment, a number of states have created voluntary programs to reduce liability risks and encourage redevelopment of brownfields. For clean or remediated properties, the state certifies that owners of such sites are not subject to federal or state liability under certain conditions. Certification could increase nearby property values because of decreased contamination risk and amenities associated with redeveloping the brownfield. This paper focuses on the Site Remediation Program in Illinois, and estimates the effect of brownfields certification on nearby property values. Employing several strategies to account for unobserved and time-varying variables that may be correlated with certification, I find that the entry and certification of a brownfield 0.25 miles away raises the value of a property by about 1% compared to an otherwise identical property.

At a general level, most clients believe that acquiring the ecolabel should be seen in prices, but most of them are unwilling to pay extra for hotel services holding this certificate.

Agriculture pays a wage penalty, and manufacturing offers a statistically significant but small premium.

As Social Security benefits are a nonlinear function of covered lifetime earnings, the simple application of the standard benefit formula to covered earnings only would provide a higher replacement rate on those earnings than is appropriate given the individuals' total (covered plus uncovered) lifetime earnings. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), established in 1983, is intended to correct this situation by applying a modified benefit formula to earnings of individuals with non-covered employment. This paper analyzes the distributional implications of the WEP and finds that it reduces benefits disproportionately for individuals with lower lifetime covered earnings. It discusses an alternative method of calculating the WEP that comes closer to preserving the intended redistribution of the system. In recognition of historical data limitations that prevent the Social Security Administration (SSA) from being able to implement this alternative method at present, the paper also analyzes two alternative ways of calculating the WEP that use the same information as the current WEP, are budget neutral, and come closer to maintaining the individual-level, cross-sectional progressivity of Social Security than does the existing WEP formula.","[Brown, Jeffrey R.; Weisbenner, Scott J.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Brown, Jeffrey R.; Weisbenner, Scott J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Brown, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",brownjr@illinois.edu; weisbenn@illinois.edu,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

We tested whether the relative effectiveness of comparative and noncomparative ads varied as a function of their fit with the audience's regulatory mode concerns, either assessment concerns with making critical evaluations or locomotion concerns with maintaining movement, with these concerns being situationally induced (Studies la and 1b) or chronic predispositions (Study 2). As predicted, three studies found that for participants with assessment concerns comparative ads were more effective than noncomparative ads, whereas for participants with locomotion concerns noncomparative ads were more effective than comparative ads.

Four dimensions of commuting variability are evaluated: space, time, travel mode, and travel route. The results indicate that the commute trip is flexible and complex in a variety of ways. Through 3D geovisualizations we were able to identify seven distinctive commuting patterns based on different combinations of the four dimensions of commuting flexibility. The results call into question the common presupposition that the commute trip is stable and fixed in many respects. Among the four dimensions of commuting flexibility, we found that variation or flexibility in time is more common than variation in the other three dimensions of commuting flexibility. This means that temporal adjustment for coping with commute problems is likely to be the most feasible option for suburban residents in Beijing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The discrepancy between such orally recognized antecedents and the written word of law have been at the heart of the recent wave of dispossessions that has swept across the country. Contra the standard critique that corruption has set the tone, this paper argues that evictions in Cambodia are often literally underwritten by the articles of law. Whereas possession' is a well-understood and accepted concept in Cambodia, a cultural basis rooted in what James C. Scott refers to as orality', coupled with a long history of subsistence agriculture, semi-nomadic lifestyles, barter economies and - until recently - widespread land availability have all ensured that notions of property' are vague among the country's majority rural poor. In drawing a firm distinction between possessions and property, where the former is premised upon actual use and the latter is embedded in exploitation, this paper examines how proprietorship is inextricably bound to the violence of law.","Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada",University of Victoria,"Springer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, POB 3060 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada.",simonspringer@gmail.com,,,,,,,111,62,70,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Specifically, firms that increase investment or total assets subsequently earn lower risk-adjusted returns. This study finds substantial cross-country differences in the asset growth effect. In particular, the asset growth effect is stronger in countries with more developed financial markets, but it does not seem to be associated with corporate governance or the costs of trading. Overall, the evidence is consistent with a q-theory where financial market development captures either managers' willingness or ability to align investment expenditures to the cost of capital, but it is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the asset growth effect is due to bad governance and overinvestment.","[Titman, Sheridan] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Titman, Sheridan] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wei, K.

In addition to all individual transactions and loan terms, we have access to details of a randomized interest rate experiment conducted by the lender on existing (inframarginal) loans. For the whole sample, we estimate a statistically significant 3.4 pound reduction in monthly credit demand in response to a five percentage point increase in interest rates. This aggregate response is small, but it masks very interesting heterogeneity in the sample. We find that only low-risk borrowers who fully utilize their credit cards lower their credit demand significantly when faced with an increase in interest rates.

This paper examines the nexus of housing prices and credit in Norway within a structural vector equilibrium correction model (SVECM) over the period 1986q2-2008q4. The results establish a two way interaction in the long-run, so that higher housing prices lead to a credit expansion, which in turn puts an upward pressure on prices. Interest rates influence housing prices indirectly through the credit channel. Furthermore, households' expectations about the future development of their own income as well as in the Norwegian economy have a significant impact on housing price growth. Dynamic simulations show how shocks are propagated and amplified. When we augment the model to include the supply side of the housing market, these effects are dampened. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We present an overview of the life settlement market, exhibit its susceptibility to longevity risk, and discuss it as part of a new asset class of longevity-related securities. We discuss pricing where the investor has updated information concerning the expected life expectancy of the insured as well as perhaps other medical information obtained from a medical underwriter. We show how to incorporate this information into the investor's valuation in a rigorous and statistically justified manner. To incorporate medical information, we apply statistical information theory to adjust an appropriate prespecified standard mortality table so as to obtain a new mortality table that exactly reflects the known medical information. We illustrate using several mortality tables including a new extension of the Lee-Carter model that allows for jumps in mortality and longevity over time. The information theoretically adjusted mortality table has a distribution consistent with the underwriter's projected life expectancy or other medical underwriter information and is as indistinguishable as possible from the prespecified mortality model.

It suggests a quantitative definition of financial distress based on the distribution of net wealth, and tests whether the probability of experiencing financial difficulty is persistent over time, using (random and fixed effects) dynamic models for binary panel data. The analysis exploits the longitudinal component of the Bank of Italy Survey on Household Income and Wealth for the period 1998-2006. Its results show that, after accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, past values of the outcome variable play a large part in explaining the probability of experiencing financial distress. In addition, the probability of financial vulnerability decreases with income and greater sophistication of the household portfolio and, at least in one of the model specifications, increases in areas with higher unemployment rates.

We study the determinants of public-sector efficiency (PSE) and in particular the role of citizens' political values. Indeed, we argue that citizens' willingness to monitor public affairs is necessary if policymakers are to be held accountable for what they do and deterred from wasting public resources. Contrary to other papers, our empirical analysis exploits within-country variation, thereby reducing the risk of omitted-variable bias and implicitly controlling for differences in formal institutions. First, we compute PSE measures for several public services (education, civil justice, health care, child care, and waste disposal) for the 103 Italian provinces; then we show that a higher degree of political engagement increases PSE. This remains true even after controlling for the possible endogeneity of political values. In our analysis, values specifically related to the political sphere are kept distinct from generically prosocial values. Our results suggest that the latter have no independent effect on PSE.","[Giordano, Raffaele; Tommasino, Pietro] Bank Italy, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Giordano, R (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",raffaela.giordano@bancaditalia.it; pietro.tommasino@bancaditalia.it,"Giordano, Raffaele/B-7388-2015",,,,,,50,21,21,1,26,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2013,69.0,3,,,,,289,316,,10.1628/001522113X671137,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,230AA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325307800003,0

Existing literature finds that low-earning unemployed workers experience difficulty accessing UI benefits. The most prominent policy reform designed to increase rates of monetary eligibility, and thus UI receipt, among these unemployed workers is the Alternative Base Period (ABP). In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act sought to increase use of the ABP, making ABP adoption a necessary precondition for states to receive their share of the $7 billion targeted at UI programs. By January 2013, 40 states and the District of Columbia had adopted the ABP despite the absence of an evaluation of ABP efficacy using nationally representative data. This study analyzes Current Population Survey data from 1987 to 2011 to assess the efficacy of the ABP in increasing UI receipt among low-educated unemployed workers. We used a natural-experiment design to capture the combined behavioral and mechanical effects of the policy change. We found no association between state-level ABP adoption and individual UI receipt for all unemployed workers. However, among part-time unemployed workers with less than a high school degree, adoption of the ABP was associated with a 2.8 percentage point increase in the probability of UI receipt.","[Gould-Werth, Alix; Shaefer, H.

Some important findings are as follows. First, we find that the ability of MSM and GARCH volatilities to predict realized volatility is better than that of implied and historical volatilities for both the index and equity options. Second, equity option volatility is more difficult to be forecast than index option volatility. Third, both index and equity option volatilities can be better forecast during non-global financial crisis periods than during global financial crisis periods. Fourth, equity option volatility exhibits distinct patterns conditional on various equity and option characteristics and its predictability by MSM and implied volatilities depends on these characteristics. And finally, we find that MSM volatility outperforms implied volatility in predicting equity option volatility conditional on various equity and option characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In China, where the environmental policy is decentralized and where environmental conflicts between provinces have occurred several times, transboundary pollution is likely to exist. However, until now, nearly all the studies have focused on developed countries. In this paper we study whether transboundary pollution problems exist in China. To do so, we estimate whether, within Hebei province, polluting firms are more likely to set up in border counties than in interior ones. The estimations of a count-data model allow us to conclude that border counties are more attractive destinations for polluting firms than counties located within the province. Moreover, it appears that this effect has strengthened over time.","[Duvivier, Chloe; Xiong, Hang] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Xiong, Hang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Nanjing Agricultural University,"Duvivier, C (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",chloe.duvivier@udamail.fr; xionghang@njau.edu.cn,,"Duvivier, Chloe/0000-0001-9647-1285",,,,,32,65,75,5,76,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Unlike the finance literature which mainly focuses on abnormal returns, our performance measures include firm size, technology, productivity, and profitability. Generally, in domestic M&As, in cross-border M&As, in the pre-merger period and in the post-merger period, acquirers perform better than targets, whereas targets perform better than non-participants. Firms' performance is improved after the M&As. We also find that in the pre-merger period, US firms that acquire foreign firms in developing countries are significantly better than those that acquire foreign firms in developed countries.","[Qiu, Larry D.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; University of International Business & Economics,"Qiu, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",larryqiu@hku.hk,,,,,,,15,10,12,1,77,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Having a disabled parent reduces a child's probability of attending school by 16%, and lowers the expected number of grades completed. The negative impact on school outcomes is larger for boys, but is more pronounced when the mother is the disabled parent. The conclusion is that to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary school, the government should directly support the education of children with disabled parents and/or support disabled adults, thus lessening the incentive for their children to not attend school.

This overreaction is commonly interpreted as reputational damage. We revisit this issue by focusing on the timing of markets' reactions and highlight two variables: the start and the speed of stock markets' responses. It appears that when operational losses are caused by internal fraud the negative market reaction materializes earlier and faster. Industry sectors and prevailing market conditions influence the timing of market reactions as well. Our empirical findings reveal moreover that a higher initial grading of the company is associated with a later stock market reaction to the announcement. While the relative magnitude and the length of markets' overreactions is positively correlated to the concomitant downgrading our study shows that overreaction magnitudes are also strongly correlated to our estimate of the total duration of the reaction.

For each country, changing the legal system is a costly process. At the same time, the existence of different legal systems is also costly for all nation-states. We show that despite the non cooperative behavior of countries, a process of legal convergence is achieved in the long run through small step by step changes. This result depends neither on the number of players in the game, nor on the time horizon of policy makers. Complete legal convergence can be obtained in a finite time. Coordinated efforts to achieve legal convergence are then unnecessary.

Potential households may choose to delay entry into the housing market by remaining with one's parents during times of economic hardship or by combining with other persons to share housing costs. Using a variety of modeling approaches, we find that both the increase in the unemployment rate and the presence of recessions reduce the rate of household formation. Simulations suggest that these declines are substantively important. For example, in a recession, the likelihood that a young adult will form an independent household falls by 1-9% points depending on the age of the person. By way of comparison, if an individual is unemployed, the likelihood of leaving the parental home is up to 11% points lower. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

(2011) demonstrate that individual investors often repurchase a stock previously traded for a profit as a learning process. When evaluating a decision, people use the most available information that comes to mind. We posit that the most recently sold stocks are the most salient. Our analysis reveals that the presence of another more recently sold stock decreases a household's propensity to repurchase a different stock by 23%. This recency effect dominates the impact of prior profitability on the repurchasing decision. The repurchase activity of investors appears to be suboptimal, partially due to commission costs and under-diversification of portfolios, which is magnified for households repurchasing at higher frequencies. More sophisticated investors demonstrate less of this behavior. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We show that this effect is moderated by the issuance of a modified audit opinion report by the auditors.

There is a dual role for credit: it allows buyers to trade without fiat money and also permits them to borrow against future income. However, not all traders have access to credit. As a result, there is a social role for fiat money because it allows agents to self-insure against the risk of not being able to use credit in some transactions. We consider a (nonlinear) monetary mechanism that is designed to enhance the credit system. An active monetary policy is sufficient for relaxing credit constraints.

The paper also presents information on the costs and policy responses associated with banking crises. The database on banking crises episodes is further complemented with dates for sovereign debt and currency crises during the same period. The paper contrasts output losses across different crises and finds that sovereign debt crises tend to be more costly than banking crises, and these in turn tend to be more costly than currency crises.

The robust forecast is based on the median of the point VaR forecasts of a set of conditional volatility models. This risk management strategy is GFC-robust in the sense that maintaining the same risk management strategies before, during and after a financial crisis would lead to comparatively low daily capital charges and violation penalties. The new method is illustrated by using the S&P500 index before, during and after the 2008-09 global financial crisis. We investigate the performance of a variety of single and combined VaR forecasts in terms of daily capital requirements and violation penalties under the Basel II Accord, as well as other criteria. The median VaR risk management strategy is GFC-robust as it provides stable results across different periods relative to other VaR forecasting models. The new strategy based on combined forecasts of single models is straightforward to incorporate into existing computer software packages that are used by banks and other financial institutions.

This higher rejection rate, as well as the requirement that all subjects agree, leads to more costly delay.

We focus on the central bank's attitude towards the evolving trade-off in its preferences between inflation and output. These preferences may shift depending on the economic structure and the composition of the monetary policy committee, making the central bank reluctant to commit to a specific trade-off between inflation and output. The quality of the information disclosed to the public is higher the more the central bank knows about how its preferences may evolve. The public forms inflation expectations reacting to the information it receives about central bank preferences, but also taking into account the worst possible inflation outcome. Macroeconomic stability is at its highest when the central bank reveals all the information it possesses about its preferences, regardless of how much the central bank knows about them. The quality of the information revealed to the public may also enhance macroeconomic stability.","European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Sánchez, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",marcelo.sanchez@ecb.int,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We demonstrate that these externalities differ in high- and low-poverty submarkets. Numerous studies have estimated the externality of foreclosures. These papers theorize that the foreclosure impact works partially through creating vacant and neglected homes. To our knowledge, this is only the second attempt to estimate the impact of vacancy itself and the first to use tax-delinquency as a measure of property neglect. We link vacancy observations from Postal Service data with property-tax delinquency and sales data from Cuyahoga County, Ohio. We find that an additional property within 500 ft that is vacant or delinquent reduces a home's selling price by 1 to 2%. In low-poverty submarkets, the negative impact of a home that is both vacant and delinquent is -4.6%. Low-poverty submarkets penalize a sale near a tax-current recent foreclosure by 4 to 8%. In high-poverty submarkets, we observe positive correlations of sale prices with vacant foreclosures. This may reflect lenders selectively foreclosing only on relatively well-maintained properties.

However, for value-added investors such as PE funds, extreme regulation also reduces the quality of capital and fund involvement. The net effect on returns is therefore ambiguous and heretofore not studied. With a new unique dataset, this paper empirically examines the performance of PE investments in Italy when leveraged buyouts are strictly regulated. The data show that extreme regulation reduces not only the supply of capital, but also PE returns and firm performance, as well as the likelihood of an IPO exit. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a heterogeneous-firm model with imperfect labor markets that captures salient features of the Mexican economy such as the differences between maquila and non-maquila manufacturing plants and the existence of an informal sector. We calibrate the model's parameters to match key cross-sectional moments characterizing the Mexican economy.

Each matrix entry is estimated using three types of instrumented regressions: (a) levels regressions; (b) growth regressions; (c) growth regressions also containing the contemporary growth of independent variables. The instruments are the 19701980 values of the variables. It is found that from 1980 to 2005 income and human development reacted relatively quickly and positively to globalization. However, institutions changed slowly, and the fundamental long-term causes of divergence, namely demographic transition, urbanization, and technology, were weakly and even negatively affected by integration.

This paper rationalizes these cross-market differences in the risk-return relationship for housing, and in so doing, explains the puzzling negative relationship. The paper shows that when the current house provides a hedge against the risk associated with the future housing consumption, households are willing to accept a lower return to compensate for risk, thus weakening the positive risk-return relationship. Further, in markets with less elastic housing supply and a growing population, hedging incentives can be sufficiently strong to make the relationship negative. The empirical analysis confirms these predictions, suggesting that hedging incentives, housing supply, and urban growth are indeed central to understanding the risk-return relationship for housing.","Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",University of Toronto,"Han, L (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",lu.han@rotman.utoronto.ca,"Han, Lu/K-4614-2015",,,,,,61,40,46,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The main findings are as follows. First, public pension is the main income for the elderly in urban China. The majority of people aged 60 and over (72% in 1995 and 82% in 2002) receive a pension. Second, the social security system in urban China has increased the income of low-income and older age groups and reduced the relative poverty rate. However, the redistributive effect did not offset the expanding income inequality, which resulted in the Gini coefficient of redistributed income in 2002 being higher than that in 1995. Third, during 1995 and 2002, both low-income and high-income groups received a positive net benefit from the social security system, but the net benefit increased with income. The Chinese social security system lacks progressivity in contribution, and does not favor the poor in terms of benefits. Fourth, assuming that the reformed policy was applied to public sector employees, the long-term redistributive effect of the pension system for the working population, calculated using their lifetime income, is larger.

Ratings issued by credit rating agencies serve a dual role: they provide information to investors and are used to regulate institutional investors. We show that introducing rating-contingent regulation that favors highly rated securities may increase or decrease rating informativeness, but unambiguously increases the volume of highly rated securities. If the regulatory advantage of highly rated securities is sufficiently large, delegated information acquisition is unsustainable, since the rating agency prefers to facilitate regulatory arbitrage by inflating ratings. Our model relates rating informativeness to the quality distribution of issuers, the complexity of assets, and issuers' outside options.

Network analysis and graph theory-based network indices were used for determining road connectivity. Land cover information derived from Landsat images was classified into seven classes: forest, water, plantation, rice, upland crops, built-up areas, and clouds. Road network connectivity and landcover for each group were compared using statistical analysis including Kendall's Tau and Wilcoxon matched pair tests.

As a result, engineers seek to integrate weather-related data into traffic operations in order to improve the current state of practice. Travel times and speeds are two of the elements of a transportation system that may be greatly affected by the weather resulting in deterioration of roadway network performance. This study aims to investigate the impact of different intensities of rain, snow and temperature levels on macroscopic travel times in the Greater London area (UK) during the period 1 October-10 December 2009. The analysis was carried out for three 2-h periods on weekdays during the morning, afternoon and evening periods. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) data obtained from more than 380 travel links are used in the analysis. The main finding is that the impact of rain and snow is a function of their intensity. Specifically, the ranges of the total travel time increase due to light, moderate and heavy rain are: 0.1-2.1%, 1.5-3.8%, and 4.0-6.0% respectively. Light snow results in travel time increases of 5.5-7.6%, whilst heavy snow causes the highest percentage delays spanning from 7.4% to 11.4%. Temperature has nearly negligible effects on travel times. It was also found that the longer links within outer London generally yield greater travel time decreases than those in inner London, and even higher decreases than the shortest links in central London. This research provides planners with additional information that can be used in traffic management to modify planning decisions and improve the transportation system control on a network scale under different weather conditions. In order to determine whether the weather effects are region-specific, continued research is needed to replicate this study in other areas that exhibit different characteristics.

Rebate programs have become a common conservation policy tool for local municipalities seeking to retrofit residential properties with efficient appliances. This research evaluates whether such rebates can be cost-effective means for water utilities to promote water conservation. A unique database is developed that combines water-use data over a three-year period for all households that participated in a utility's high-efficiency toilet (HET) rebate program, water-use data for a matched sample of neighbors who did not receive a rebate, and a survey of rebate participants. Difference-in-differences models indicate that installation of an HET reduces household water consumption by approximately 7 percent. While installation of an HET appears to be an effective means for achieving household reductions in water consumption, our results also suggest that the rebate program is a much less effective means for achieving household reductions in water consumption. Specifically, the rebate program is found to provide limited additional water savings beyond what would have occurred naturally and is responsible for only 37 percent of the total water reduction attributable to the installation of HETs over the study period.

The results indicate that the reform altered saving behavior by reducing voluntary pension saving coverage among high income earners by 4 percentage points and increasing it among low income earners by 2 percentage points. The reform also reduced annual saving contributions among high income earners by over 20%.

In this term, the general situation of economy can be explained shortly as spiral of high real interest rates, entries of hot money, low value of national currency as a result of frequent and huge devaluations in the value of national currency. Since 2002, transition to the strong economy program has been put into practice as a result of crises with the effect of crises experienced at the end of 1990 and at the beginning of 2000. Short summary of this term points out that various structures are the case in Turkish economy. The aim of this paper is to present the regime structure of Turkey's economy in the period from the beginning of 1990 to 2007, in other words, determination of regime change periods. In this study, Markov switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) models are used in determining the regime structure. Analyses are done for the period 1992:01-2007:03 by using current account, GDP growth rate, ratio of import coverage by export and interest rate series which are important and continuously observed macroeconomic variables and findings of this analyze exhibit the existence of three different regimes in this time period. This study's findings, especially related to the particular characteristics of pre-crisis period, contribute to reduce uncertainty and guide for decision makers in money and financial markets.","[Koc, Selcuk] Kocaeli Univ, IIBF, Iktisat Bolumu, Kocaeli 41380, Turkey; [Akgul, Isil] Marmara Univ, Iktisat Fak, Ekonometri Bolumu, TR-34722 Kadikoy, Turkey",Kocaeli University; Marmara University,"Koç, S (通讯作者)，Kocaeli Univ, IIBF, Iktisat Bolumu, Umuttepe Kampusu, Kocaeli 41380, Turkey.",selcukkoc@kocaeli.edu.tr; iakgul@marmara.edu.tr,"KOÇ, Selçuk/W-3455-2017","KOÇ, Selçuk/0000-0001-7451-2699",,,,,103,1,1,1,12,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

For instance, in the context of corporate default prediction a typical approach is to estimate a hazard model by regressing the hazard rate on time-varying covariates like balance sheet or stock market variables. If the prediction horizon covers multiple periods, this leads to the problem that the future evolution of these covariates is unknown. Consequently, some authors have proposed a framework that augments the prediction problem by covariate forecasting models. In this paper, we present simple alternatives for multi-period prediction that avoid the burden to specify and estimate a model for the covariate processes. In an application to North American public firms, we show that the proposed models deliver high out-of-sample predictive accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Death and destruction alter the structure and dynamics of households, including their demographic profiles and traditional gender roles. To date, attention to the gender impacts of conflict has focused almost exclusively on sexual and gender-based violence. We show that a far wider set of gender issues must be considered to better document the human consequences of war and to design effective postconflict policies. The emerging empirical evidence is organized using a framework that identifies both the differential impacts of violent conflict on males and females (first-round impacts) and the role of gender inequality in framing adaptive responses to conflict (second-round impacts). Wars mortality burden is disproportionately borne by males, whereas women and children constitute a majority of refugees and the displaced. Indirect war impacts on health are more equally distributed between the genders. Conflicts create households headed by widows who can be especially vulnerable to intergenerational poverty. Second-round impacts can provide opportunities for women in work and politics triggered by the absence of men. Households adapt to conflict with changes in marriage and fertility, migration, investments in childrens health and schooling, and the distribution of labor between the genders. The impacts of conflict are heterogeneous and can either increase or decrease preexisting gender inequalities. Describing these gender differential effects is a first step toward developing evidence-based conflict prevention and postconflict policy.","[Gupta, Monica Das; Casabonne, Ursula] World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Verwimp, Philip] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Brussels, Belgium",The World Bank; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA,,mayra.buvinic@gmail.com,,,,,,,99,53,61,2,92,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Moreover, when disentangling different motives of the more pronounced unethical conduct under team incentives, we find that subjects tend to lie more under team incentives because they can diffuse their responsibility, i.e., their deceptive acts cannot unambiguously be attributed to them individually.

The lacunae and ambiguities of the African National Congress concerning land and agricultural policy during the political transition of 19904 and since then in government are also important here. The paper considers transformation(s) with respect to farm labour, regulating agribusiness, and land reform, black farming, and Black Economic Empowerment (BEE, specifically AgriBEE).

As with all forms of management of meaning, apologies and aggressive attitudes must be seen as parts of a wider political process where different parties seek to draw in neutrals by adopting a moral high ground, where alliances are formed and dissolved and where conflicts move from one terrain to another, assuming different forms as they do so.

The proposed speculative strategy works with the assumption of everyday increase of intra-day volatility at the specified time. The reason is opening of Tokyo Trading Session at 2:00 AM UTC+1. With regard to the time of holding the speculative positions this is a short-term strategy where at 11:59 PM UTC+1 all open positions are closed. For the reason of the short-term position holding the difference between the buy and the sell price reaches tenths of a dollar (for 1 USD investment). Effectiveness of the speculative strategy is increased by financial leverage which is able to increase effectiveness of the strategy 10 1000 times. The size of the financial leverage depends on the selection of the provider of access to the currency market and also on the selection of the trader. The purpose of this article is a detailed analysis of the controlled risk increase in relation to the achieved overall profit from the speculative strategy.

Results were subsequently validated in a quantitative survey of 250 respondents in the Klang Valley. Despite the increasing number of supermarkets and hypermarkets, not only are the traditional markets able to coexist with modern retail formats, but they remain the preferred place for respondents to purchase fresh meat.","[Chamhuri, Norshamliza] Natl Univ Malaysia UKM, Sch Econ & Management, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Batt, Peter J.] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Management, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Curtin University,"Chamhuri, N (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Malaysia UKM, Sch Econ & Management, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.",shamliza@ukm.my; p.batt@curtin.edu.au,,,,,,,76,28,32,0,7,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Traditional market segments, typically split into business and leisure travellers, can be developed further through the examination of the influence that life stage exerts upon air travel choices, particularly for leisure trips. Life stage can be defined as a specific, optional event. The two key life stages of having children and entering retirement are examined in this paper in relation to individual air travel behaviour, in order to determine the primary characteristics of the associated market segments. The paper is based on a series of household air travel surveys and focus groups. Findings show the distinct characteristics of family air travel, such as higher air fare sensitivity, as well as in-group variations due to factors such as the age of the child (or children). Retirement is also shown to impact upon air travel, affecting individuals in different ways. Some in retirement take advantage of greater time availability and fly more frequently; others will cut back, say due to health problems. Aviation industry implications, both in terms of surface access to airports and regional airport provision, are also presented. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Its mission is to accelerate progress, and its primary point of leverage is to build on the needs of food companies to demonstrate sustainable production of ingredients. To achieve this end, the Food Lab creates a pre-competitive space for member organizations to pilot innovations through business driven supply chain projects and provides opportunities for diverse stakeholders working on sustainability to meet, learn, and support each other in becoming better leaders for change in their organizations and in the larger system.

Nevertheless, questions regarding price negotiation and the determinants of importing firms' profitability remain unanswered. Using firm-level data, we attempt to address these issues in the context of the Chinese steel industry. Despite being the largest producer of steel in the world, the Chinese steel industry has maintained a very low level of profitability. This paper suggests that the low profitability of Chinese steel producers results from the abnormally high degree of market segmentation in China. Using a recently developed econometric method in panel data spatial analysis, we explain the level of geographic fragmentation in the Chinese steel industry. Our results reveal that local steel production depends only on local demand rather than on cross-regional demand. Production is responsive, as a 10% increase in local GDP induces more than 8% increase in local steel production, while the cross-province spill-over demand is insignificant under several reasonable model specifications. Less efficient firms survive because of the segmented market. As a result, Chinese steel producers realize lower profit in the face of high input prices.","[Ju, Jiandong] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Int Econ Res, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ju, Jiandong] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Su, Li] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Su, L (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",suli0917@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,3,3,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

This paper analyzes the scientific literature on the topic of theoretical concepts of trust; influencing factors in the formation of the consumer confidence in commercial banks are discussed; the model of consumers` confidence in commercial banking is provided. The model puts the influencing factors into three categories, representing trust formation stages. The first stage in the formation of confidence is attributed to the factors determining the initial choice of the bank. In other words, this is the information that a potential commercial banking services consumer can access without starting the co-operation with the certain bank. The formation of a second phase encapsulates confidence factors affecting further cooperation with a commercial bank, i.e. the information that the user receives in collaboration with a financial institution and the opinion that he (the user) of the financial institution, forms in the initial phase of cooperation. The third phase consists of the factor, determining the emergence of trust in commercial banks.","[Jureviciene, Daiva; Skvarciany, Viktorija] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,,daiva.jureviciene@mruni.eu; viktorija.skvarciany@gmail.com,"Skvarciany, Viktorija/P-7584-2016; Skvarciany, Viktorija/K-7419-2019","Skvarciany, Viktorija/0000-0001-8022-4124; Skvarciany, Viktorija/0000-0001-8022-4124",,,,,14,2,2,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,532,540,,,,,,9,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100054,0

Finance is one of the oldest branches existing at the UEP established at the same time as the University, in September 1953. At that time the soviet economic model was applied on the Czechoslovak economy including the field of finance. So the translations of soviet textbooks were used in addition to the Czech ones. In the sixties the problems in development of the Czechoslovak economy intensified and the necessity to strengthen the role of money in the economy was emphasized. This tendency reflected in the contents of teaching process. The period of normalization broke these efforts, but the teaching had never been completely restored to the position it had in the sixties. After 1989 the teaching concentrated on the role of finance in the conditions of market economy. Study program provides knowledge of the issues of financial markets, banking, insurance, national and local budgets and public finance.","Univ Econ, Dept Monetary Theory & Policy, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Koderová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Monetary Theory & Policy, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",koderova@vse.cz,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,5,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

It is therefore important to ensure that the success rate of postgraduates is monitored on a continuous basis. However, a number of higher education institutions are currently unable to deliver a sufficient number of students to meet the national targets set by the Department of Education. This is especially the case at open and distance learning (ODL) institutions. The current paper focuses on the low number of postgraduate students that specialise in Information Technology (IT) a matter of great concern as IT skills and competencies are crucial to ensure that South Africa remains internationally competitive in the economic sector. A framework for postgraduate supervision for IT is proposed, based on data related to headcount, throughput rate, completion time and dropout rate of postgraduate students in the School of Computing at an ODL institution (South Africa). The aim of the framework is to propose how postgraduate students in ODL should be assisted by supervisors to increase postgraduate success. The main focus will be on the different supervisory roles and the responsibility of these roles in the attempt to increase postgraduate success within an ODL environment.","[Kritzinger, Elmarie; Loock, Marianne] Univ S Africa, Sch Comp, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,,kritze@unisa.ac.za; loockm@unisa.ac.za,"Kritzinger, Elmarie/A-9982-2013; Kritzinger, Elmarie/AAE-1009-2020; Loock, Marianne/B-1195-2015","Kritzinger, Elmarie/0000-0002-5141-4348; Kritzinger, Elmarie/0000-0002-5141-4348; Loock, Marianne/0000-0001-8005-716X",,,,,32,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1236,1248,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500122,0

The aim of this article is to assess how the rural areas differ from the urban areas in certain features important for rural development. The basis for analysis is the current definition of rural areas according to the European Union on NUTS 3 level (analogy of kraj in the Czech Republic). The dataset from 2003 until 2011 includes 16 indicators from the area of population, economics, labour market, constructions, health and social security. The differences among values of particular indicator in predominantly rural (PR), intermediate (IN) and predominantly urban (PU) areas are tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. When there are significant dissimilarities found, the particular means which differ from each other are tested using Tuckey's test. According to our findings, we came to the conclusion that there are not statistically significant differences among PR, IN and PU shires in mortality, average living floor area per completed dwelling, healthcare indicators and average old-age person. On the other hand, there are statistically significant differences in other demographic features, economic characteristics and in labour market indicators. Therefore, the different situation of the PR areas might be a good argument justifying special attention and potential financial support.","[Pechrova, Marie] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Demog, FIS, CZ-13067 Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pechrová, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",pechrova@pef.czu.cz; ondrej.simpach@vse.cz,"Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018",,Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Manageme of the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [20121054:11110/1312/3112],Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Manageme of the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague,The paper is supported by the internal grant: Vyuziti financnich prostredku fondu EU pro rozvoj venkova No. 20121054:11110/1312/3112 of the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Manageme of the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague.,,29,2,2,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,322,334,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300029,0

While the support from individuals and from businesses has been largely unaffected by the crisis, or has only been affected very briefly, the funding from the state has decreased, even though not very dramatically.

But how are the different economic world regions performing regarding globalization of trade flows? Why are they performing differently? Globalization is not only the increase of international trade between certain preferential geographic areas of economy, but also the resulting increase of interweavement of trade flows between different geographical areas, independent of the amount of trade. This paper analyzes the world trade flows between 2003 and 2011 and performs a cross-section analysis of the year 2011. The economic interweavement will be measured by an inequality risk metric applied to the supply-demand matrix. This risk indicator is based on the concept of statistical entropy resulting in an inequality risk measure, giving an indication for the degree of economic globalization and the evolution of globalization in different geographical regions. The result of this research shows that economic trade flows are globalizing but with clear different regional patterns. Indeed, the emerging economies such as China or the Middle East are globalizing whereas mature economies such as North America and Europe are de-globalizing, confirming for globalization the inverse Kuznets evolution. The different patterns between the different economic world regions can be explained by using the globalization type's model. (C) 2013 The Authors.

This has been attributed to the failure of NWPG to enlist IT as a risk management tool in their strategic objectives. The study used questionnaires that were distributed to employees and a return rate of 72% was achieved. Using quantitative research approach, and descriptive and exploratory statistics techniques, it was noted that the department has feasible resources to manage its risk. The challenge however is that there is neither no measures in place to reduce the IT risk nor that employees have not been made aware about such risk. Nonetheless, the department has other security controls available. Factor analysis results revealed 15 items being explained by two factors. It is recommended that employees should be made aware of the risk control measures, reporting procedures and risks in their department.

In order to achieve the main objective of the paper three tasks were carried out: (i) presenting the system of fiscal (including so called agricultural tax and income tax from the special agricultural sectors) and parafiscal (mainly, social security contribution for the Agricultural Social Insurance Fund - KRUS) in Polish agriculture; (ii) analysis of the level of fiscal and parafiscal burden, given the type of farms; (iii) analysis of dependencies between the level of fiscal and parafiscal levies, farm net income, as well as cash flow.

A further issue, we address, is the relative importance of the quality of the realized measure as an input in a given forecasting model vs. the model's dynamic specification. The main finding is that the largest gains result from switching from daily to high-frequency data. Further gains are achieved if a simple sparse sampling covariance measure is replaced with a more efficient and noise-robust estimator. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The major problem with THIS is the system performance and capabilities which influence the level of acceptance and satisfaction among the users of THIS. Therefore, the primary concern of this study is to examine the mediating role of nurses' satisfaction in the relationship between perceived usefulness, ease of use and system capability with performance of clinical tasks. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Selayang Hospital. Data were collected from participants who were nurses working in various disciplines in the hospital. Four hypotheses were formulated to guide this study. The findings suggest that perceived usefulness is related with nurses' satisfaction, ease of use is related with nursers' satisfaction, system capability is related to nurses' satisfaction and nurses'satisfaction related to performance of clinical tasks and therefore all four hypotheses are supported. However, it is recommended that caution be taken in crediting the level of acceptance solely from predicting the capabilities and successfulness of a system.

With bivariate regression, vulnerability function of crop caused by flood among variables of crops' disaster affected area, rainfall process volume and terrain was built. Using vulnerability function, warning line of rainfall volume was calculated for each county when its disaster affected area of crop exceeds warning area. Finally, early warning conditional probability model of crops in flooding that total rainfall can exceed warning rainfall volume line provided one-day and multi-days forecast rainfall volume as conditions was constructed, and risk early-warning zonation can be done according to warning probability.

In a comment, Bornhoff and Lee (this issue) question this finding on model-specification grounds. By undertaking three changes, they purport to show that our main result does not hold. In this article, we demonstrate that one of these changes is inconsequential (replacing GDP per capita by its logarithm in controlling for conditional convergence) and argue that two of them are questionable. First, the removal of certain central control variable risks introducing omitted variable bias and inconsistent estimates. Second, regional dummy variables are added on arbitrary grounds. For example, by using regional dummy variables that are just as reasonable as the Baltic dummy used by Bornhoff and Lee, we find that significance for tolerance toward homosexuals reappears in our empirical model. In all, this implies that there are good grounds for considering the negative relationship between tolerance towards homosexuals and growth valid, Bornhoff and Lee's claims notwithstanding.","[Berggren, Niclas; Elinder, Mikael] Res Inst Ind Econ, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Berggren, Niclas] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Dept Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Elinder, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Prague University of Economics & Business; Uppsala University,"Berggren, N (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ, POB 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",niclas.berggren@ifn.se; mikael.elinder@nek.uu.se,"Berggren, Niclas/N-3578-2019","Berggren, Niclas/0000-0003-0673-5123",,,,,9,7,8,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2012,153.0,3-4,,,,,495,502,,10.1007/s11127-012-0034-x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,055SR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312438200015,0

However; despite his views on freedoms, Hayek did not hesitate to support dictators. According to a doubting Paul Samuelson a mixed economy may provide more individual freedoms than does a pure price economy and the type of efficient free markets championed by Hayek can only be maintained by use of power. In this work we focus on Hayek and analyze his views on free markets and freedoms by adopting the concepts of unknowability and liberal authoritarianism. We argue that some views of Hayek justify the use of force for achieving certain economic goals and that this use is necessary for the maintenance of the type of free market notion Hayek adopted.","[Madenci, Can] Marmara Univ, Iktisat Fak, Istanbul, Turkey",Marmara University,"Madenci, C (通讯作者)，Istanbul Evleri,Roza 19,Daire 23, Bahcelievler Istanbul, Turkey.",can_madenci@yahoo.com,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,10,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Using cross-country data on financial structures and crises, we find that there is a significant short-term reversal in development of the banking sector and the stock market during both bank crises and market crashes, with the corporate bond market moving in the same direction as bank credit. However, the results are significant for countries with market-based financial systems but not for countries with bank-based financial systems. Emerging markets have mainly bank-based financial systems, which may explain why these markets require more time to recover from economic downturns after a financial crisis. Therefore, we argue that governments should emphasize a balanced financial system structure as it helps countries to recover from financial crises more quickly compared with countries that lack such balanced structures.

While there is generally a positive correlation between a return prediction model's out-of-sample statistical performance and its ability to add economic value, the relation tends to be weak and only explains a small part of the cross-sectional variation in different models' economic value.

Our review reveals a number of methods issues that are largely particular to this type of research. We conclude that amidst exemplary contributions, much of the reviewed research has not adequately managed these methods challenges, nor has it made use of the full potential of this new research approach. Specifically, we identify and suggest remedies for context-specific and interrelated methods challenges relating to sample definition, choice of level of analysis, operationalization and conceptualization, use of longitudinal data and dealing with various types of problematic heterogeneity. In addition, we note that future research can make further strides towards full utilization of the advantages of the research approach through better matching (from either direction) between theories and the phenomena captured in the data, and by addressing some under-explored research questions for which the approach may be particularly fruitful.","[Davidsson, Per; Gordon, Scott R.] Queensland Univ Technol, Australian Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Davidsson, Per] Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Jonkoping University,"Davidsson, P (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Australian Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",per.davidsson@qut.edu.au; sr.gordon@qut.edu.au,"Davidsson, Per E L/I-9989-2012; Gordon, Scott/J-1093-2012","Gordon, Scott/0000-0003-2757-551X; Davidsson, Per/0000-0002-6363-1382",,,,,129,139,161,4,103,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using bond-specific and firm-specific data for China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand during 1995-2009 we find that firms with better financial health face lower external finance premia in all countries. When we introduce firm-level heterogeneity, we show that financial variables appear to be both statistically and quantitatively more important for financially constrained firms. Finally, when we examine the effects of the 1997-1998 Asian crisis and the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, we find that the sensitivity of the premium is greater for constrained firms during the Asian crisis compared to other times.

We first document an asymmetric effect of trade payables and receivables on cash holdings, in that firms hold an additional $0.71 of cash for every $1 of credit payable but use $1 of receivables as a substitute for only $0.15 of cash. We then find that firms in regions with higher levels of financial deepening hold less cash for payables while substituting more receivables for cash. A more highly developed financial sector helps firms to better use trade credit as a short-term financing instrument. Finally, we find that the ratio at which receivables are substituted for cash increased following the implementation of the new receivables pledge policy in 2007, which allowed firms to use receivables as security for loans. This policy event represents an exogenous shock that mitigates the endogeneity concern. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, violence can occur either when queues are very long or when large numbers of citizens are not provided goods being allocated with queuing mechanisms. Hence, we use the theory of discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) to construct and analyze models in which we explicitly account for queue length and the number of citizens who are not provided a good that is allocated with a queuing mechanism. Specifically, we first delineate a version of our DTMC model in which there is no capacity constraint. Second, we state two key properties of this model and then we derive our first metric of the likelihood of violence.

It addresses two questions: (1) is disengagement a negative outcome? and (2) are all cases of disengagement homogeneous? The literature identifies two types of disengagements based on the degree of learning by nascent entrepreneurs. Intelligent exit refers to proactive or strategic disengagement precipitated by entrepreneurs' learning that concluded the business opportunity would not be successful. From this perspective, entrepreneurs could adopt discovering or enacting modes and their related causal or effectual approaches to learning. Reactive or uninformed exit results from lack of planning and an inability to solve problems. Results suggest two different disengagement clusters-the intelligent and reactive exit clusters-but the distinction between discovering and enacting approaches to learning is not supported. Cases of intelligent exit are found to be more similar to cases of operating businesses than they are to cases of reactive exit.","Old Dominion Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Yusuf, JE (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, 2096 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",wieyusuf@gmail.com,"Yusuf, Wie/ABD-5321-2020","Yusuf, Wie/0000-0003-3599-1417",,,,,38,21,27,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper assesses the possible consequences of relaxing these restrictions for China's internal economic geography. We base our analysis on a new economic geography (NEG) model. First, we estimate the important model parameters using data on 264 of China's prefecture cities. Second, we use these estimates as inputs in a simulation of the full NEG model under different labor mobility regimes. We find that increased labor mobility leads to more pronounced core-periphery outcomes. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing in particular will further strengthen their dominant place in China's urban hierarchy. In addition, two other groups of cities can be distinguished: those in China's populous heartland offering preferential access to China's enormous internal market, and more peripheral cities that are better shielded from competition with China's economic heartland by virtue of their relative remoteness.

A core question underlies the analysis: can HST effects spread from the core city to surrounding sub-regions, or could they widen the gap between core and peripheral places? A comparative case study of two regions - Manchester and its sub-regions in North West England (UK) and Lille and its sub-regions in Nord-Pas-de-Calais (France) - with similar industrial trajectories and opportunities allied to two different HST approaches was conducted to offer crucial insights. The findings showed that for both regions, the arrival of HSTs did assist the development towards the knowledge economy, but the specific aspects vary. Also, the differential effects existed: the connection with the national capital by faster train services did economically strengthen the regional capital, but not some sub-regions around it, especially former industrial sub-regions. The comparison between the two regions shows that the transformation of post-industrial regions and sub-regions towards the knowledge economy brought by HSTs proves a complex and difficult process. Both post-industrial regions are still in the course of transition. In Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the wider economic transformation is just beginning to happen, while the laboriously-upgraded West Coast Main Line seems to demonstrate limits to its transformative power. This process involves much more than being connected with highspeed trains, significant as this may be. A full investigation of causality deserves another paper, but the findings suggested three critical factors: the economic trajectory and its infrastructure needs, a HST hub strategy and the simultaneous improvement of the intra-regional transport network, and path dependency.

Indeed, when both the intercity and intra-urban distributions of activities are given, a higher population density makes cities more environmentally friendly because the average commuting length is reduced. However, when we account for the possible relocation of activities within and between cities in response to a higher population density, the latter may cease to hold. Indeed, an increasing-density policy affects prices, wages and land rents, which in turn incentivizes firms and households to change place. This reshapes the urban system in a way that may generate a higher level of pollution. Thus, although an increase in compactness is environmentally desirable when locations are given, compactness may not be environmentally-friendly when one accounts for the general equilibrium effects generated by such a policy.

We model transit shares by means of a logistic regression that takes into account over-dispersion and spatial autocorrelation. The results of the final model indicate that accessibility by transit is a significant predictor of modal share in our case study. Technically, our analysis clearly illustrates that ignoring over-dispersion and autocorrelation can result in misleading inference and erroneous policy prescriptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Building primarily on the philosophies of Felix Ravaisson and John Dewey, we outline an approach to travel habits that is more affirmative than prevailing psychological perspectives. Rather than as the automatically cued, repetitive behaviour of individuals, habit is understood here as a generative and propulsive capacity brought about through repetition and belonging to body-mind-world assemblages that exceed the human individual as conventionally understood. The implications of the proposed conceptualisation of habits for behaviour change are also explored. We argue that widespread, durable behaviour change is unlikely to result from the displacement of automaticity by reasoned action alone but instead demands changes in collective customs. Additionally, a narrow focus on breaking carbon-intensive travel habits should be avoided. Not only should the formation of low-carbon habits and associated forms of embodied intelligence be stimulated; it is also important to capitalise on the potential for subtle change inherent to carbon-intensive travel habits in situations where individualised vehicular travel is the only realistic transport option.

Using various proxies for product market competition, and reductions of import tariff rates to capture exogenous changes to a firm's competitive environment, I find that competition has a significantly positive effect on the cost of bank debt. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the effect of competition is greater in industries in which small firms face financially strong rivals, in industries with intense strategic interactions between firms, and in illiquid industries. Overall, these findings suggest that banks price financial contracts by taking into account the risk that arises from product market competition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The tension between inheritance and search for novelty is the subject of the article. Building on an in-depth case study of Acorn Computers and ARM semiconductors, we present a model of intergenerational learning and spin-off performance. Early parental influence is followed by intense learning, improvisation and response to feedback from the market. This we term reimprinting, to emphasize the enduring competitive and organizational identity established early on by the spin-off, which in this case provided the basis for disruptive innovation.

Despite significant advances in environmental assessment, geographic information systems and data analysis, this requirement would impose technical, informational and administrative expenses that most regulators - notably in developing countries - seem unable to afford. This paper shows that it can actually be less demanding than it seems. If polluters are price-takers, for instance, in a context where the affected population concentrates at a given location, then the optimal emission tax will disregard a source's location. Otherwise, the adjustment of the optimal tax to location will depend on the extent of a polluter's market power.","[Marrouch, Walid] Lebanese Amer Univ, Sch Business, Lebanon, NH USA; [Sinclair-Desgagne, Bernard] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; Ecole Polytechn Paris, Paris, France",Lebanese American University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Marrouch, W (通讯作者)，Lebanese Amer Univ, Sch Business, Lebanon, NH USA.",walid.marrouch@lau.edu.lb; bsd@hec.ca,"Marrouch, Walid/D-5597-2019","Marrouch, Walid/0000-0001-8488-6555",,,,,20,10,10,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We test these relationships by combining country-level institutional indicators for 47 countries with working-age population survey data taken from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. Our results indicate that entrepreneurial entry is inversely related to the size of the government, and more weakly to the extent of corruption. A cluster of institutional indicators representing market freedom is only significant in some specifications. Freedom from corruption is significantly related to entrepreneurial entry, especially when the richest countries are removed from the sample, but unlike the size of government, the results on corruption are not confirmed by country-level fixed-effects models.","[Aidis, Ruta; Estrin, Saul; Mickiewicz, Tomasz Marek] UCL, London WC1H 0BW, England",University of London; University College London,"Mickiewicz, TM (通讯作者)，UCL, 16 Taviton St, London WC1H 0BW, England.",t.mickiewicz@ucl.ac.uk,"Mickiewicz, Tomasz/AAC-8016-2019; estrin, saul/AAC-7000-2020","Mickiewicz, Tomasz/0000-0001-5261-5662; estrin, saul/0000-0002-3447-8593",,,,,93,241,264,7,103,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using comprehensive data on both prime and subprime securitized and bank-held loans, we provide evidence that securitization affected lenders' screening decisions in the subprime market for low-documentation loans through two channels: the securitization rate and the time it takes to securitize a loan. The change in decision-making by subprime lenders occurs on dimensions that are unreported to investors. Examining the time-series evolution of the securitization market further reinforces these findings. We exploit heterogeneity across subprime and prime markets to illustrate that the potential for moral hazard may be reduced with greater collection of hard information and increased monitoring of lenders. Our results suggest that the policy debate regarding securitization and lenders' underwriting standards should separately evaluate the agency and non-agency markets, with special attention toward the extent of soft information in assets being securitized.","[Seru, Amit] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Keys, Benjamin J.] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Vig, Vikrant] London Business Sch, London, England",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of London; London Business School,"Seru, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",amit.seru@chicagobooth.edu,"Vig, Vikrant/G-6932-2014",,,,,,29,105,135,2,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

It does so by examining the variability in person-based accessibility to urban opportunities over a 1-week period. Accessibility is specified on the basis of persons rather than places and measured for each day of the week rather than for a single day. An empirical case of government offices in the city of Ghent (Belgium) is used to demonstrate how space-time accessibility may fluctuate between persons and per person from day to day. The case study provides evidence that, even for fulltime workers on weekdays, considerable day-today variability in the accessibility level of a single person can exist as a consequence of differences in space-time constraints.

Several products are responsible for health as well as environmental damages. Many consumers do not possess the required information to optimally substitute away from these products. However, as the stock of information regarding the negative effects of these products builds up, an increasing fraction of consumers behaves optimally. The government uses two policy instruments, environmental taxation and information provision. We show that as the accumulated stock of information increases, the optimal tax rate declines over time. Information provision can shift market demand towards environmentally friendly goods over time, and thus reduce the required level of the tax rate. Our results provide strong evidence in support of information campaigns as a policy instrument to supplement traditional environmental policies.","[Sartzetakis, Eftichios S.] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece; [Xepapadeas, Anastasios] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Petrakis, Emmanuel] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon, Crete, Greece",University of Macedonia; Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Crete,"Sartzetakis, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",esartz@uom.gr; xepapad@aueb.gr; petrakis@econ.soc.uoc.gr,"Xepapadeas, Anastasios/ABH-3240-2020; Sartzetakis, Eftichios Sofokles/J-1938-2016; petrakis, emmanuel/M-9330-2015","Sartzetakis, Eftichios Sofokles/0000-0001-7997-7575; petrakis, emmanuel/0000-0003-1273-8099",,,,,29,22,23,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Analysis of panel data on 44 developing countries between 1960 and 2000 suggests that the difference in growth rates between the period an economy is open and the period it is closed depends inversely on the degree of wealth inequality prior to opening.

We find a non-monotonic relationship between inequality and redistribution and explore under which conditions an unequal society relies more heavily on indirect taxes to finance redistribution.

The effect of liquidity shortage is not well measured, nor is the effect of strategic default well identified. We use the maximum likelihood (ML) approach to estimate the default barrier model and the Merton-KMV model using market values of equities in a sample of 762 public industrial firms. The estimated barrier is below leverage in our sample. The default probability from the two structural models provides similar in-sample fits, but the default barrier framework achieves better out-of-sample forecasts. Our analysis also focuses on the factors that influence the level of the implied default barrier when leverage is endogenous, and shows that endogenous leverage is not the only determinant of the default barrier as predicted by the standard structural credit model. The implied default threshold is positively related to financing costs, and negatively related to liquidity, asset volatility, and firm size. Three strategic default variables (liquidation costs, renegotiation frictions and equity holders' bargaining power) increase the implied default barrier level. This evidence supports strategic default models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First, we derive an upper bound for the mean approximation error, given stationarity of the log dividend-price ratio. Next, we simulate various rational bubbles that have explosive conditional expectation, and we investigate the magnitude of the approximation error in those cases. We find that, surprisingly, the Campbell-Shiller approximation is very accurate even in the presence of large explosive bubbles. Only in very large samples do we find evidence that bubbles generate large approximation errors. Finally, we show that a bubble model in which expected returns are constant can explain the predictability of stock returns from the dividend-price ratio that many previous studies have documented.","[Engsted, Tom; Pedersen, Thomas Q.; Tanggaard, Carsten] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University; CREATES,"Engsted, T (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, CREATES, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",tengsted@creates.au.dk; tqpedersen@creates.au.dk; ctang-gaard@creates.au.dk,,,,,,,34,25,28,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

By polarizing the electorate, the incumbent politician weakens the ability of independent voters to make him accountable for his policies in the common interest. Moreover, the interests of the incumbent and the opposition are aligned: the opposition also benefits from divisive politics because, in equilibrium, its election probability increases.

Since trade liberalization increases unemployment in the import competing sector and reduces it in the export sector, the impact on economy wide unemployment is ambiguous. While job destruction increases upon impact in the import competing sector, there is no immediate decrease in job destruction in the export sector leading to short term spikes in the net job destruction and unemployment rates in response to trade liberalization. Trade liberalization increases intersectoral wage inequality, however, intra-sectoral wage inequality increases in the export sector but decreases in the import competing sector. Finally, a more generous unemployment benefit increases the responsiveness of job destruction to trade liberalization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These reports are issued before the IPO shares start trading on the stock market and detail how underwriters determined fair value. We document that underwriters often employ multiples valuation, dividend discount models and discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to determine fair value but that all of these valuation methods suffer from a positive bias with respect to equilibrium market value. We also analyze how this fair value estimate is subsequently used as a basis for IPO pricing. We report that underwriters deliberately discount the fair value estimate when setting the preliminary offer price. Part of the intentional price discount can be recovered by higher price updates. We find that, controlling for other factors such as investor demand, part of underpricing stems from this intentional price discount. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Various explanations exist for this effect, varying in their dependence on the strategic content of the communication. Previous studies have found similar communication effects regardless of whether strategic communication is available. These results were so far taken to support a social-preferences based explanation of the communication effects. The current experiment provides a replication and extension of previous results to show that different processes come into play, depending on the communication protocol. Specifically, pre-play communication in an ultimatum game was either restricted to non-game-related content or unrestricted. The results show that strategic, but not social, communication affects responders' strategies. Thus, the existing results are cast in a new light.

These differences are explained by other firm-specific factors such as geographical location, whether it is a family firm, and prices paid for quotas. Consequently, investment strategies are not necessarily driven by efficiency considerations, and quota trade may not increase allocative efficiency.","Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Nostbakken, L (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",,,/0000-0002-4339-5095,,,,,43,19,19,1,19,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0023-7639,1543-8325,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,MAY,2012,88.0,2,,,,,400,424,,10.3368/le.88.2.400,0.0,,,25,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245QJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326478600011,0

Such incidental disgust strongly countered status quo bias. Disgusted people exchanged their present possession 51% of the time compared to 32% for people in a neutral state. Thus, disgust promotes disposal. A second experiment tested whether a warning about this tendency would diminish it. It did not. These results indicate a robust disgust-promotes-disposal effect.

Recent advances in strategic voting theory demonstrate that voter uncertainty about competitors' true support levels in the constituency may lead to limited strategic voting, and hence incomplete desertion of trailing parties. This is the first attempt to estimate empirically the impact of uncertainty on incentives to vote strategically. Calibrating a model of strategic voting to voting results from simple plurality elections in German constituencies, it is found that strategic voters operate under high levels of uncertainty.

Classical models of globalization and trade, based upon the international exchange of finished goods, fail to capture the fragmentation of much commodity production and the geographical separation of individual production tasks. This fragmentation, captured in the growing volume of intra-industry trade, prompts investigation of the effects of trade within, rather than between, sectors of the economy. In this paper we examine the relationship between international trade and the task structure of US employment. We link disaggregate US trade data from 1972 to 2006, the NBER manufacturing database, the Decennial Census, and occupational and task data from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Within-industry shifts in task characteristics are linked to import competition and technological change. Our results suggest that trade has played a major role in the growth in relative demand for nonroutine tasks, particularly those requiring high levels of interpersonal interaction.","[Kemeny, Thomas] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Rigby, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Kemeny, T (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",tkemeny@email.unc.edu,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041022] Funding Source: Medline; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0961735] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,54,29,34,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The Kyoto-Copenhagen agenda was intended to do this with a system of international cap and trade. We view these negotiations as a game in which countries choose their quantity targets based on self interest. Like the analogous public-goods game, in which countries choose their abatement levels, we find this game leads to uncooperative behavior and suggest that this is why the Kyoto approach inevitably failed. By contrast, a game in which all countries vote for a global quantity target or a global price target can lead to a highly cooperative choice of target. However the assignment of responsibilities for a global quantity target stymies implementation of a global cap. The global-price-target game largely overcomes this barrier; because a uniform global price provides a focal point for cooperation. However low-emission countries apparently prefer a much lower global-price than more prosperous countries unless a Green Fund is implemented. A game that couples such a fund to the global price target can largely overcome this barrier to cooperation. We describe such a game along with its equilibrium outcome, which promises to be inexpensive and cooperative.","[Cramton, Peter] Univ Maryland, Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Stoft, Steven] Global Energy Policy Ctr, New York, NY USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Cramton, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Cramton, Peter/ABG-7651-2021","Cramton, Peter/0000-0001-8621-1092",,,,,12,12,13,1,17,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

The existing literature on climate policy pays insufficient attention to small countries, which account for a substantial proportion of global emission. In this study, we investigate how climate policy and learning about climate damage affect investment in abatement technology in small countries. We consider three alternative climate policy instruments: emission standards, harmonized taxes and auctioned permits. We say that learning is feasible if an international environmental agreement (IEA) is formed after the resolution of uncertainty about climate damage. We find that, either with learning and quadratic abatement costs or without learning, harmonized taxes outperform emission standards and auctioned permits in terms of investment efficiency. Without learning, a large cost of nonparticipation (that a country incurs) in the IEA can be beneficial to the country. Whether learning improves investment efficiency depends on the size of this nonparticipation cost.","[Hong, Fuhai] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wang, Susheng] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Clear Water Bay, NT, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Hong, FH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",hong.fuhai@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,"Hong, Fuhai/0000-0001-8681-4926",,,,,26,2,4,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In the context of equity mutual funds, fee dispersion stems primarily from the heterogeneity of products, clienteles and production functions. However, the relevant theory predicts that search costs can also generate fee dispersion. By controlling for observable sources of heterogeneity, we find that fee dispersion decreases with fund size and age, as well as with the amount of assets under management of the investment company. In addition, we find lower levels of fee dispersion for funds that charge marketing and distribution fees.

This article analyzes the differences between RRGs and standard insurers specializing in commercial liability insurance to determine the cost of duplicative regulation. The costs associated with multi-state regulation are significantly higher than those for single-entity regulation.

An important gap in the theoretical literature is filled, by being the first paper to provide a model of twin crises in the presence of imperfect competition in banking, and the changes in market structure that occur in the aftermath of crises. Doing so, the analysis is able to reveal that currency devaluations generate more severe twin crises in economies with less competitive banking sectors.

Because stocks are backed not only by projects in place, but also by the options to modify current projects and undertake new ones, the expected returns on stocks need not satisfy the CAPM even when expected returns of projects do. We provide empirical support for our arguments by developing a method for estimating firms' project CAPM betas and project returns.

Monte Carlo simulation of a springbuck-based meat production enterprise was used to quantify the risks that would be faced by springbuck ranchers. Springbuck ranching has been proven a viable alternative in the production of highly nutritious and healthy meat (venison) that is in high demand in European markets and more recently, with a promising and increasing local demand as well. The results indicate that in the Eastern Cape Karoo, springbuck ranching for meat production is a viable business. As the call for more environmentally friendly rangelands utilisation economic systems intensifies, rangelands owners in the Eastern Cape Karoo have a practicable option. At the very least, an alternative to broaden their incomes with springbuck-based meat production exists.","[Dlamini, T. S.; Fraser, G. C.

The relationship of defect - occupants' satisfaction - loyalty behavior in the Build-then-sell houses however is yet to be explored. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the relationship between the three mentioned variables. Data were collected from the occupants who have stayed in the Build-Then-Sell houses for three years; a period whereby housing defect (patent defect) would normally occur. Housing defect was measured using three severity levels; low, medium and high and was cross-tabulated with the dichotomous question of satisfied and dissatisfied occupants. Subsequently, occupants' satisfaction was cross-tabulated with their loyalty behavior. The Pearson chi-square result shows a significant correlation between housing defects and occupants' satisfaction. Meanwhile, for the occupants' satisfaction and loyalty behavior, there is no significant correlation between the variables. The cross-tabulation for occupants' satisfaction loyalty behavior reveals that the large portions of satisfied as well as dissatisfied occupants tend to project loyal behavior towards Build-Then-Sell houses. The result implies that defect is a factor which relates to occupants' satisfaction but the occupants' satisfaction is not a factor that relates to occupants' loyalty behavior.

For our sample and time frame, we find that stronger intellectual property protection is not important in determining overseas research and development by these multinationals.

The authors have developed a robust framework, which food-sector entrepreneurs can use to increase profitability of an existing business or to create new profitable opportunities. The value chain approach provides win-win opportunities for players within the value chain. To test the robustness of the framework, the authors use food waste as an example of a critical inefficiency and apply it to two different food sector business cases, each operating in diverse conditions. Because the suggested framework addresses the core elements and parameters for the existence and competitiveness of a business, the model can be adapted to other sectors.","[Kouwenhoven, Gerry; von Losoncz, Ton Lossonczy] Inholland Univ Appl Sci, Unit Agr, NL-2628 AL Delft, Zuid Holland, Netherlands; [Nalla, Vijayender Reddy] RVJ Eurasia Food & Agro BV, NL-3621 KA Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Kouwenhoven, G (通讯作者)，Inholland Univ Appl Sci, Unit Agr, Rotterdamseweg 141, NL-2628 AL Delft, Zuid Holland, Netherlands.",gerry.kouwenhoven@inholland.nl; vijayender@rvjservices.nl; ton.lossonczy@inholland.nl,,,,,,,31,13,13,0,26,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The contribution of livelihood activities to household income, level of livelihood diversity and the relationship between livelihood diversification and adaptation to flood variability was determined. Data from a survey of 623 households in five villages, focus group discussions and key informant interviews confirmed livelihood diversification as an important strategy for household adaptation to flood variability in the Delta. However, the household income portfolio was dominated by public transfers, underscoring the weak socio-economic status of the households and the effects of multiple shocks over and above flood variability. The study concludes that livelihood diversification and other household adaptive strategies may be sufficient for current flood variations, but may be inadequate for dealing with global climate variability and change in future.","[Motsholapheko, M.

Among others, we can mention the significant difference between the market value and the net book value of the intangible assets. In the best case scenario, the intangible like the human skills or the customers' value are usually improperly recognized or accounted for. We talk about further implication when the auditors certify that the balance sheet shows the fair view of the financial position of business in spite of the fact that it is not showing all the values involved. There have been only few researches in this field have and there is no model available, which could be considered to be free from major limitations. The major limitation of the existing models is that there is a clear difficulty to correctly identify all types of intangible assets and their influence inside a business.

The review of the literature illustrates ideological debates around the meaning and significance of contract farming and whether it is good or bad for small-scale farmers. The paper then divides the review of the literature into three key themes. First, it addresses the quantitative significance of contract farming in Africa, which may not be as important as it is often portrayed. Second, the paper highlights the substantial diversity of contract farming in Africa and problems with excessive generalizations. Third, it discusses the various drivers fuelling the spread of contract farming, which reflect new production conditions and existing constraints, tendencies and counter-tendencies, and both economic and political responses to changes in production and market conditions in the era of liberalization and globalization. The variety of drivers is substantial and defies generalizations about the emergence of contract farming. Finally, it briefly suggests research questions that tend to be absent in most of the literature on contract farming, and which are important in order to understand the current dynamics of agrarian change and transitions to capitalism in African countries.","Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Oya, C (通讯作者)，Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England.",co2@soas.ac.uk,,"Oya, Carlos/0000-0003-0379-6377",,,,,144,200,222,4,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We have than evaluated our indices by the effectiveness to identify periods of increased financial stress based on the deviation by one standard deviation of the value of the index from the median value. Comparing periods identified with this method with historical periods of increased financial stress, we came to the conclusion that my financial stress index for each country successfully identifies the development and level of stress in financial system.","Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Simácek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",milan.simacek@seznam.cz,,,,,,,28,1,1,2,17,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

When addressed by economists, demographic questions are most frequently related to the pension reform or to the costs of healthcare. However, the effects of demographic change on productivity have to be examined, too. Will the economies be able to maintain the necessary amount of immigrants, so that the number of people in productive age does not decrease? Though the world population will keep increasing for some time, it will be happening at a much slower pace. The age structure issue will become apparent only with a minor delay in the developed economies, yet it may have a strong impact on the future migration potential. Another crucial question is the potential economic consequence of the changing proportion between the original population with its cultural and work habits and the immigrants. As can be observed and demonstrated, the issue of ageing will first become apparent in countries with a high share of industry and construction in GDP. Economies with a high share of services, on the other hand, will be less affected. The Czech Republic is a classic example of an economy based on industry and construction. Therefore, in ten or twenty years the country will face a rather insoluble problem, as the nature of its economy will clash with its demographic structure.","[Smrcka, Lubos; Arltova, Marketa] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Smrcka, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",smrckal@vse.cz; arltova@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018","Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171",,,,,25,13,14,0,19,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The aim of the paper is to find if the information asymmetry prevents the consumer to find optimal product and if yes then to model what price rational consumer will choose. For this purpose we reworked Stigler's model into the model more suitable for the small market needs. We used this model on the retail core banking services to individuals in the Czech Republic. On this market the information asymmetry was found within the European Union research as well as within our own research. We find that information asymmetry prevents even low search cost user the optimal price choice, we are abstracting from the influence of scattered knowledge, advertisement etc. However for more than half of the products on this market it is rational to search for the better price and so to generate positive savings. Also we state that information asymmetry is mostly caused by variable costs on search that express the task of a final price determination. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a simple method to construct a contingent liability index (CLI) for a banking sector that takes into account the size and concentration of the banking system, market expectations of bank defaults, and perceptions of government support to each bank. This method allows us to track potential government liabilities related to bank failures for 32 advanced and emerging economies on a monthly basis from 2006 to 2013. Furthermore, we find that the CLI is a significant determinant of sovereign CDS spreads. Our results suggest that a 1 percentage point increase in the CLI is associated with an increase in sovereign CDS spreads by 24 basis points for advanced economies and 75 basis points for emerging markets on average.

In an attempt to answer this question, we use a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with a housing sector to explore the economic impacts of a central bank reacting to house price inflation. We examine this in the context of two different shocks that are associated with two factors cited as possible underlying sources of the recent bubble in the housing market and the ensuing financial crisis. First, we allow for a positive shock to the household borrowing constraint. Second, we analyze the effects of a preference shock to housing. Our results indicate that these two shocks lead to a more pronounced increase in house prices and an expansion of the housing sector if the central bank does not react to house prices. If the central bank reacts to house price increases, it must accept lower output growth rates over the business cycle. We also show that welfare decreases if a central bank reacts to house price inflation. Because of these effects, a central bank may be reluctant to react to house price inflation.

In less than a decade, PBSPs have grown from a small number of European cities to include five continents and in excess of 200 schemes. Despite the rapid rise of this new transport opportunity, there has been limited research on the underlying dynamics of these schemes, arguably reflecting a lack of detailed data available to researchers. The current paper redresses the observed deficit using trip level data from Brisbane's 'CityCycle', the largest PBSP in Australia. These data provide an opportunity to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of a large PBSP system, specifically the effects of weather and calendar events on the geographic and temporal patterning of public bicycle use. Employing novel spatial analytical techniques we explore the impact of site specific weather conditions and calendar events on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the case study PBSP. We conclude by highlighting how the results from such analyses may form part of an evidence base for policy makers, providing insights into 'best practice' and potentially informing future PBSP expansions to further enhance uptake of this non-motorised urban transport mode.

Employing the difference-indifference approach, we show that the program did not have a significant impact on capital investments of subsidy recipients, contrary to its intentions. We also find that a matched group of non-recipients on average exhibited a higher degree of cash hoarding behavior than subsidy-recipients in the post-program period, which suggests that the program eased external financial constraints of recipient-firms. Consistent with the theory on precautionary cash savings by firms, we further find that firms non-recipients based in cities with low banking development accumulated more cash holdings than recipients based in cities with a high banking development. Overall, our findings indicate that greater cash holdings are positively associated with the level of financial constraints of firms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article presents the estimation of tail risk at very high quantiles using a semiparametric estimator which is particularly suitable for portfolios with a large number of assets. The estimator captures simultaneously the information contained in each individual asset return that composes the portfolio, and the interrelation between assets. Noticeably, the accuracy of the estimates does not deteriorate when the number of assets in the portfolio increases. The implementation is as easy for a large number of assets as it is for a small number. We estimate the probability distribution of large losses for the American stock market considering portfolios with ten, fifty and one hundred assets of stocks with different market capitalization. In either case, the approximation for the portfolio tail risk is very accurate. We compare our results with well known benchmark models. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Less is known, however, about how these emerge in developing countries, and what they can tell us about citizens' role in innovation to achieve more sustainable transport systems. This case study examines a social movement that emerged in opposition to the country's first major highway concession, in Santiago, Chile (1997), challenging and changing urban planning paradigms. In 2000, the anti-highway campaign founded a citizen institution, Living City (Ciudad Viva). Twelve years later, it has become a prize-winning, citizen-led planning institution. Although the role of citizen participation in improving transport systems has become increasingly recognized in recent years, it still tends to be rather ritualistic. This experience offers insight into how strategic approaches to participation can reinforce the role of self-organizing civil society organizations in introducing innovation into existing systems. Findings suggest that traditional large movements, which are mainly useful for one-way communication of information, require support from small groups able to deliberate in a transformative sense, with more attention paid to how new consensuses can be transmitted through the relational networks of those involved. Moreover, this experience suggests that thinking about citizens as planners in their own right, rather than as mere participants at specific points in a planning process, opens the way to more effective strategies for innovating in transport, to address the social, environmental, and other challenges humanity faces today.

Our results reveal that R&D investments positively affect the probability of becoming a HGF. However, differences appear between manufacturing and service firms.

This unintended consequence of LOLR facilities manifests itself as excess illiquid leverage in the financial sector, can make future liquidity shortfalls more likely, and can lead to an increase in default risks. Furthermore, this increase in default risk can occur despite the fact that the combination of LOLR facilities and reduced asset sales raises the prices of illiquid assets. The behavior of U.S. broker-dealers during the crisis of 2007-09 is consistent with this unintended consequence. In particular, given the Federal Reserve's LOLR facilities, broker-dealers could afford to try to wait out the crisis. Although they did reduce traditional measures of leverage to varying degrees, they failed to reduce sufficiently their illiquid leverage, which contributed to their failures or near failures. Several mechanisms to address this unintended consequence of LOLR facilities are proposed.","[Acharya, Viral V.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Finance, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Acharya, Viral V.] CEPR, London, England; [Acharya, Viral V.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tuckman, Bruce] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Tuckman, Bruce] Ctr Financial Stabil, London, England",New York University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University,"Acharya, VV (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Finance, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"Acharya, Viral V./HCH-4349-2022",,,,,,20,5,5,0,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The paper also finds that a larger share of girls among household members is positively associated with a larger budget share on transportation, suggesting that parents pay more for girls' transportation, possibly because of safety concerns. The results also suggest that, despite some earlier results in the literature, the adult goods method is capable of detecting gender bias, although alcohol and tobacco may not be suitable for detecting gender bias.","[Fuwa, Nobuhiko] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1690051, Japan; [Fuwa, Nobuhiko] Int Rice Res Inst, Los Banos, Philippines",Waseda University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Fuwa, N (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Shinjuku Ku, 1-21-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1690051, Japan.",nfuwa@waseda.jp,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

But a CCS facility consumes vast amounts of energy and capital. With this in mind we analyze macroeconomic consequences of a large scale introduction of CCS in China. We modify and extend the DRC-CGE, a macroeconomic CGE model of the country that is used for long-term planning and policy analyses. We analyze an internal finance scenario of domestic funding, and an external finance scenario of international funding. In the external finance scenario CCS is installed on 70 % of all power plants by 2050. This increases demand for coal in 2050 by one fifth and import of coal by one fourth. The strain on coal resources may be an important political concern for China. In the internal finance scenario coal resources are not strained since this scenario introduces a price on carbon that lifts prices of energy. Moreover, the price on carbon cuts across the board and the internal finance scenario is much more effective at reducing . On the other hand, in this scenario GDP goes down about 4 %, which also raises political concern.","[Vennemo, Haakon] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Oslo, Norway; [He, Jianwu; Li, Shantong] Dev Res Ctr State Council, Beijing, Peoples R China",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Vennemo, H (通讯作者)，Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Oslo, Norway.",haakon.vennemo@vista-analyse.no; jianwu@drc.gov.cn; shantung@drc.gov.cn,,,,,,,36,6,6,8,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In the first one, we face individuals with a dynamic environment in which their decisions, together with chance, determine their future options. We find that previously faced opportunities influence subsequent choices in predictable ways. Having faced worse options in the past significantly increases individuals' risk aversion and having faced better options reduces it. These patterns are at odds with most existing decision theories, including Expected Utility Theory and standard implementations of Prospect Theory, the dominant models of economic decision making. In our second experiment, we present participants with a similar decision environment, but in which the opportunities they face do not depend on their past choices. The effect of previously faced options on decision behavior in this environment is considerably reduced. This shows that being responsible for forgoing opportunities is an important factor in their influence on behavior, which underscores the relevance of emotions linked to counterfactual thinking, like regret or satisfaction. These results highlight that theories formulated in cognitive terms are not enough to provide an adequate account of the role of forgone opportunities in decision making under risk and uncertainty.","[Barreda-Tarrazona, Ivan; Jaramillo-Gutierrez, Ainhoa; Sabater-Grande, Gerardo] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain; [Barreda-Tarrazona, Ivan; Jaramillo-Gutierrez, Ainhoa; Sabater-Grande, Gerardo] Univ Jaume 1, LEE, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain; [Navarro-Martinez, Daniel] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Navarro-Martinez, Daniel] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I; Pompeu Fabra University,"Navarro-Martinez, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",daniel.navarro@upf.edu,"Navarro-Martinez, Daniel/D-6848-2013; Barreda-Tarrazona, Iván/N-3606-2014; Jaramillo-Gutiérrez, Ainhoa/JNE-6120-2023; Sabater-Grande, Gerardo/AAG-8433-2021","Barreda-Tarrazona, Iván/0000-0002-1247-0582; Jaramillo-Gutiérrez, Ainhoa/0000-0002-1359-4333; Sabater-Grande, Gerardo/0000-0001-5990-4512; Navarro-Martinez, Daniel/0000-0003-4126-1680",,,,,49,4,5,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

This paper employs individual credit record data, and Census data on payday lender store locations, to assess these concerns. Taking advantage of several state law changes since 2006 and, following previous work, within-state-year differences in access arising from proximity to states that allow payday loans, I find little to no effect of payday loans on credit scores, new delinquencies, or the likelihood of overdrawing credit lines. The analysis also indicates that neighborhood racial composition has little influence on payday lender store locations conditional on income, wealth and demographic characteristics.

These channels include the transmission of shocks operating through changes in the higher order comoments of asset returns, including changes in coskewness arising from changes in the interaction between volatility and average returns across asset markets. These additional contagion channels have nontrivial implications for the pricing of options through changes in the payoff probability structure and more generally, in the management of financial risks. The effects of incorrectly pricing risk has proved to be significant during many financial crises, including the subprime crisis from mid 2007 to mid 2008, the Great Recession beginning 2008 and the European debt crisis from 2010. Using an exchange options model, the effects of changes in the comoments of asset returns across asset markets are investigated with special emphasis given to understanding the effects on hedging risk during financial crises. The results reveal that by not correctly pricing the risks arising from higher order moments during financial crises, there is significant mispricing of options, while hedged portfolios during noncrisis periods become exposed to price movements in times of crises.

In Norway, local governments with persistent deficits are placed in the Register for State Review and Approval of Financial Obligations (Robek). In addition to increased central government monitoring, placement in Robek triggers a great deal of attention in the local media. It is thus expected to raise voter awareness of the fiscal stance of the local government. The results indicate that voters value the information embedded in this signal, and take it into account when casting their votes. Both the share of votes for the incumbent's party and the probability that the incumbent party stays in office is significantly reduced as a consequence of the local government being included in the register. The vote share for the incumbent is reduced by about three percentage points, while the reelection probability is reduced by about 0.12.","[Hopland, Arnt O.] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, NoCeT, Bergen, Norway; [Hopland, Arnt O.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Hopland, Arnt O.] NHH, Dept Business & Management Sci, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Hopland, AO (通讯作者)，NHH, Dept Business & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",arnt.hopland@nhh.no,,,,,,,24,14,14,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2014,161.0,1-2,,,,,233,255,,10.1007/s11127-014-0151-9,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AN4BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340532400013,0

We mainly refer to the efficiency of the financial markets in transmitting information through the prices and, more specifically, to the predictabilty of asset returns. We first recall the concept of market efficiency formulated by Fama in 1970 and we give an overview of the numerous empirical studies about this concept during the ten years after this contribution and more precisely on the predictability in short run returns. Typically these methods find very modest predictability. Then we recall how Shiller questioned the efficiency property in 1981, by pointing out the excess volatility of prices compared to the one of the fundamentals and how this finding inspired many empirical studies on the predictability in long run returns. Both Fama and Shiller and many others discovered that such predictability becomes an important and even the dominant influence on longer-run movements in asset prices. Two main strands of research have thus followed. Broadly speaking, Fama believes that asset price movements can be understood using economic models with rational investors, whereas Shiller does not. Indeed the first strand advocated by Fama consists in improving the models explaining the pricing of financial assets while maintaining the rational expectation hypothesis; using the econometric method of GMM introduced by Hansen [1982] is thus decisive to test the non linear constraints implied by these models. On the other side, Shiller helped to launch the strand of resarch related to behavioral finance, and investigated, as well as Hansen and others, deviations from rational expectations.","Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75647 Paris 13, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Bruneau, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",cbruneau475@gmail.com,,,,,,,89,1,1,0,20,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

A tragedy of the commons arises where officials set bribe payments too high and so drive firms out of the industry. Other models predict the opposite as numerous officials in a decentralized bureaucracy bid down bribe payments. Using the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey from the World Bank, a firm level survey covering 24 former communist countries and Turkey, we examine whether reported bribe payments by firms are higher when firms face potentially numerous demands for bribes. We find that bribe payments are higher under a more decentralized bureaucratic structure.

Families should fully insure if purchasing insurance does not increase the probability of kidnapping, and partially insure otherwise. Kidnapping insurance allows families to redeem hostages from kidnappers with a greater willingness to kill, which may reduce the number of kidnapping fatalities as long as the insurance does not increase the risk of kidnapping too much.","[Fink, Alexander] Univ Leipzig, Inst Wirtschaftspolit, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Pingle, Mark] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Leipzig University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Fink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Wirtschaftspolit, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",alexander.fink@uni-leipzig.de; pingle@unr.edu,,,,,,,42,12,16,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,481,499,,10.1007/s11127-013-0108-4,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600011,0

However, we also find strong support for non-constant, declining discount rates for longer time horizons, with an extrapolated implied annual discount rate approaching 0.5 % in 100 years. There is heterogeneity in discount rates and risk preferences in that people with more optimistic beliefs about technological progress have higher discount rates. These findings contribute to the debate over the appropriate discount rate to use in comparing the long-term benefits of climate change mitigation to the more immediate costs.","[Grijalva, Therese C.] Weber State Univ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Shaw, W.

The paper tests if conditions found in informality interfere with transition pathways in production clusters. 102 semi-structured interviews were conducted with industry participants, including 69 production firms. Findings confirm the existence of important agglomeration economies, but those benefits are curtailed due to constraints of informality on firms, especially location constraints in urban space. At the same time, informality also introduces particular diseconomies of agglomeration that undermine the value of proximity of firms to each other, particularly within clusters.

Whether corruption produces the same effects everywhere or whether its effects are conditional on some country characteristics are important questions. We investigate the association between corruption and growth, where the marginal impact of corruption is allowed to differ across democratic and nondemocratic regimes. Using cross-country, annual data from 1984 to 2007, we regress growth on corruption, democracy and their interaction. We find that decreases in corruption raise growth but more so in authoritarian regimes. Possible reasons are that in autocracies corruption causes more uncertainty, is of a more pernicious nature, or is less substitutable with other forms of rent seeking.","[Assiotis, Andreas] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Sylwester, Kevin] So Illinois Univ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",University of Cyprus; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Assiotis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",assiotis.andreas@ucy.ac.cy,,,,,,,32,10,13,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We exploit the exceptional characteristics of the Italian data (the fine geographical disaggregation, the very high number of countries of origin of immigrants, the high heterogeneity of social and economic characteristics of Italian provinces, and the absence of cultural or historical ties with the countries where immigrants come from) coupled with the use of a wide set of fixed effects and an 'instrument' based on immigrants' enclaves. We find that immigrants have a significant positive effect on both exports and imports, but much larger for the latter. The pro-trade effects of immigrants tend to decline in space, and even turn negative when large ethnic communities are located too far away from a specific province (via a trade-diversion effect). Moreover, while our data show inter-ethnic spillovers for exports, we find no evidence that networks between different ethnicities affect provinces' imports. Finally, we provide evidence of a substantial heterogeneity in the effects of immigrants: the impact on trade tends to be larger for immigrants coming from low-income countries, for earlier waves of immigrants, and for least advanced provinces (Southern Italy).","[Bratti, Massimiliano] Univ Milan, DEMM, I-20122 Milan, MI, Italy; [De Benedictis, Luca] Univ Macerata, DED, I-62100 Macerata, MC, Italy; [Santoni, Gianluca] Scuola Super Sant Anna, IE, I-56127 Pisa, PI, Italy",University of Milan; University of Macerata; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"De Benedictis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, DED, Via Crescimbeni 20, I-62100 Macerata, MC, Italy.",massimiliano.bratti@unimi.it; luca.debenedictis@unimc.it; g.santoni@sssup.it,"santoni, gianluca/AAJ-3958-2020; De Benedictis, Luca/K-7678-2019; De Benedictis, Luca/C-9114-2011; Bratti, Massimiliano/J-6811-2012","santoni, gianluca/0000-0002-8853-0051; De Benedictis, Luca/0000-0001-8245-3940; De Benedictis, Luca/0000-0001-8245-3940; Bratti, Massimiliano/0000-0002-4565-6260",,,,,57,38,44,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We develop an enforcement model of a quota-regulated resource and focus on a situation with significant non-compliance and exogenous constraints on fines and enforcement budget. We propose a new enforcement system based on self-reporting of excess extraction and explicit differentiation of inspection rates depending on compliance history. We use differentiated inspections to induce firms to self-report excess extraction. This system increases the effectiveness of the quota by allowing the regulator to implement a wider range of aggregate extraction targets than under traditional enforcement, while ensuring an efficient allocation of extraction.

We focus the study on the transition period after the policy has raised input prices for production but before establishment of new equilibrium in agricultural commodity markets. We construct a policy simulation model based on production economics that explicitly considers producer behavior in the focal period. We apply the model to a production region in the US to quantify the impact of different levels of carbon price on production cost, production value, and farm income. Our case study shows that: (1) producers have ability to alleviate the cost impact, (2) producers may benefit by selling carbon credits in the carbon market but the revenue is likely to be limited, (3) the economic return of farm production is critical to the impact assessment, (4) the impact may vary across producers, and (5) regulation on the fertilizer industry is an important policy element that can influence the assessment of the impact.

To do that, we construct a database containing the structure of ownership as well as the CEO compensation for 104 French firms listed in the SBF120 index on a period spanning from 2005 to 2012. Ownership is categorized according to two main criteria: the degree of involvement and the investment horizon of shareholders. The results show that the less involved the shareholders are into the control of the company, the higher the CEO salary will be. The salary appears eventually as a measure of the degree of delegation to the CEO. Secondly, we find that bonuses are related to the time horizon of shareholders: the more short-term oriented shareholders are, the higher the weight of bonuses and the more sensitive to annual accounting and financial performance of the company they will be. Thirdly, equity-based compensation is used evenly by almost all types of shareholders, but the annual sensitivity to accounting and financial performance is higher for less involved and short-term investors. Eventually, our results show that agency theory prescriptions about CEO compensation are mostly applied by short-term and less involved shareholders.","Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, EconomiX CNRS, F-92001 Nanterre, France",Universite Paris Nanterre; Universite Paris Saclay,"Almeida, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",lionel.almeida@u-paris10.fr,,"Almeida, Lionel/0000-0002-2228-4089",,,,,13,1,1,1,18,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The GHG Emissions Impacts of Consuming Imported versus Domestically Produced Food,ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,CGE model; Emissions intensity; Food miles debate; Livestock emissions; Transport emissions,MILES; TRADE,"With the increased interest in the 'carbon footprint' of global economic activities, civil society, governments and the private sector are calling into question the wisdom of transporting food products across continents instead of consuming locally produced food. While the proposition that local consumption will reduce one's carbon footprint may seem obvious at first glance, this conclusion is not at all clear when one considers that the economic emissions intensity of food production varies widely across regions. In this paper we concentrate on the tradeoff between production and transport emissions reductions by testing the following hypothesis: Substitution of domestic for imported food will reduce the direct and indirect Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with consumption. We focus on ruminant livestock since it has the highest emissions intensity across food sectors, but we also consider other food products as well, and alternately perturb the mix of domestic and imported food products by a marginal (equal) amount. We then compare the emissions associated with each of these consumption changes in order to compute a marginal emissions intensity of local food consumption, by country and product. The variations in regional ruminant emissions intensities have profound implications for the food miles debate. While shifting consumption patterns in wealthy countries from imported to domestic livestock products reduces GHG emissions associated with international trade and transport activity, we find that these transport emissions reductions are swamped by changes in global emissions due to differences in GHG emissions intensities of production. Therefore, diverting consumption to local goods only reduces global emissions when undertaken in regions with relatively low emissions intensities. For non-ruminant products, the story is more nuanced. Transport costs are more important in the case of dairy products and vegetable oils. Overall, domestic emissions intensities are the dominant part of the food miles story in about 90 % of the country/commodity cases examined here.","[Avetisyan, Misak] Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Hertel, Thomas] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sampson, Gregory] Int Trade Ctr, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland",University of Southern California; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Avetisyan, M (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 3710 McClintock Ave,RTH 322, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",mgavetis@price.usc.edu,,,,,,,39,63,69,6,140,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Returns on subsidized debt are significantly above its market cost, with no subsequent surge in default risk.

We show that decentralization improved enrollment rates in public schools and access of the poor to public health services. In both sectors, improving access was driven by the financial contributions of local governments. Small increases in own-shares of spending led to surprisingly large increases in the access of the poor in both sectors. Our theoretical model implies that where local information dominates productive efficiency, elected local governments will provide services better tailored to local needs. Decentralizing such services should increase their use by the public. Together, theory and empirics imply that decentralization made the Colombian state more accountable.

We examine the returns of put writing and other option strategies by comparing historical option returns with returns generated using option pricing models. We find it is generally possible to reject the hypothesis that put returns are consistent with option pricing models. An implication is that the average cost of buying out-of-the-money put options to provide tail-risk protection to a portfolio may include a significant premium.

We also study the gender wage gap after dividing the labor market into core and peripheral sectors considering structural labor market characteristics, such as firm size, employment type, and education level. According to empirical analysis, we find that the glass ceiling effect for irregular female workers with lower levels of education working in small and medium-sized companies is much stronger compared with those in other sectors under the multi-layered Korean labor market structure. This result implies that the glass ceiling effect is weak in the core sector, while in a peripheral sector, invisible gender discrimination increases as the wage quantile moves from lower to higher levels. Based upon these empirical results, we discuss a policy direction that deals simultaneously with the dual structure of the labor market and gender discrimination. J. Japanese Int.

Given that the household may default, risk-neutral lenders efficiently charge a default premium to hedge against expected losses. This has two major consequences. First, the higher the house price volatility, the higher the down payment the household provides to decrease the volatility of the equity share in the house. Second, in the presence of borrowing constraints, higher risk of unemployment persistence and/or a substantial drop in labor income decreases the leveraged position the household takes on.","European Cent Bank, Financial Res Div, DG Res, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Corradin, S (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Financial Res Div, DG Res, Frankfurt, Germany.",stefano.corradin@ecb.int,,,,,,,49,9,10,3,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Main ingredients of the model are frictions in the form of participation costs in the interbank market, a refinancing operation with unlimited liquidity supply and two standing facilities offered by the central bank. The model can explain several stylized facts observed during the financial crisis as the decline in interbank borrowing and the interbank rate, the increased borrowing from the Eurosystem and the strong recourse to its deposit facility. Furthermore, we discuss some policy implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We generally find that investors react rationally to these fund listings based on the predictability of performance.

Although instructional time is considered an important input for the education production function, there is limited consensus on its causal effect on later outcomes. This is because of the difficulty of estimation without relying on cross-country variation or on before-and-after comparison. By using a feature of the centralised Japanese public educational system, this paper estimates the effect of the revision in junior high schools as a difference-in-differences estimator. The revision is unique because it reduces the total school teaching hours by 445, which corresponds to about 13% of the previous standards, leaving the length of school weeks or the educational system unchanged. The main results show that the revision decreases schooling by about 0.5 years and the probability to enrol in high school by about 3-4% for women. These results are statistically significant and robust to controlling for the birth cohort or regional effects. J. Japanese Int. Economies xxx (xx) (2014) xxx-xxx.

The results in this paper suggest that home and US economic policy uncertainty directly increase exchange rate volatility for some of the currencies examined. For the more integrated industrial economies, there is strong evidence that both home-country and US economic policy uncertainty increase currency volatility during bad economic times. For the less integrated emerging economies, only home-country economic policy uncertainty increases exchange rate volatility during bad economic times. General economic uncertainty also increases exchange rate volatility, but its impact is generally smaller than that of economic policy uncertainty. Given that previous research has found a negative relationship between exchange rate volatility and economic activity, these results suggest that economic policy uncertainty can negatively affect economic performance.","Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Econ, Northridge, CA 91330 USA",California State University System; California State University Northridge,"Krol, R (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Econ, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",robert.krol@csun.edu,,,,,,,33,99,102,7,92,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Amongst these units, traffic analysis zones (TAZs) have been broadly employed in many macroscopic safety studies. Nevertheless, no studies questioned the validity of TAZs for crash analysis at the macro-level crash modeling. In this study, we point out several possible problems of TAZs as spatial units for macroscopic safety studies. Current TAZs with homogenous crash rates were combined into new single zones. Then we created ten new zonal systems by different zone aggregation levels. The optimal zonal scale for traffic safety analysis zones (TSAZ) was determined using the Brown-Forsythe test. It was found that the zone system with about 1:2 aggregation was the optimal zone system for macroscopic safety modeling. Thus we develop what we call traffic safety analysis zones (TSAZs) that has the potential of reducing several possible problems of TAZs. Also it was shown that TSAZ based models had better fit compared to TAZ based models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a sample of 14,380 investments by 1,852 LPs in 1,250 buyout and venture capital funds started between 1991 and 2006, we find that the superior performance of endowment investors in the 1991-1998 period, documented by prior literature, is mostly due to their greater access to the top-performing venture capital partnerships. In the subsequent 19992006 period, endowments no longer outperform, no longer have greater access to funds that are likely to restrict access, and do not make better investment selections than other types of institutional investors. Nevertheless, all investor types' private equity investments continue to outperform public markets on average.

We assess individual differences on the basis of a self-reported Effortful Control (Adult Temperament Questionnaire) and actual behavior during the task, while controlling for age. Using event-related fMRI, in a population of 41 healthy 18-24-year-old males, choosing for the delayed option activated a network including the inferior frontal gyrus, lateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Decisions of individuals who delay more often during the task are associated with more activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. They furthermore show correlated activity between the inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal regions during decision making compared with individuals who behave more impulsively. Choosing for the earlier reward was not associated with any increases in brain activation compared to choosing for the delayed reward. However, individuals who behave more impulsively show more activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate cortex, medial frontal gyrus), and no correlated activity with the inferior frontal gyrus. These findings could not be replicated when groups were based on self-report data. We conclude that individual differences in self-control during time discounting may partly result from differential activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.","[Waegeman, Anja; Declerck, Carolyn H.; Boone, Christophe] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Hecke, Wim] Univ Antwerp, Vis Lab, Dept Phys, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Parizel, Paul M.] Univ Antwerp Hosp, Dept Radiol, Antwerp, Belgium; [Parizel, Paul M.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"Waegeman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Management, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",anja.waegeman@uantwerp.be,"Boone, Christophe/K-4945-2015; Declerck, Carolyn H/A-1508-2016","Boone, Christophe/0000-0001-7311-0217; Parizel, Paul M./0000-0002-0221-2854",,,,,42,18,20,0,32,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

If the proportion of low-utilization types is small, there is a separating equilibrium at which tenure choice acts as a screening device: consistent with empirical evidence, low-utilization households buy a house, while high-utilization types rent. Otherwise, there is a pooling equilibrium. The reason why, contrary to standard screening models, a pooling equilibrium possibly exists is indivisibility of home ownership, which makes it a very costly screening device. Introducing partial ownership restores the standard results: non-existence of a pooling equilibrium and possible nonexistence of equilibrium. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using static cointegration analysis, we find that the SEE markets are cointegrated with the German and the UK markets over the period 2000-2013, but not with the USA market. Furthermore, the dynamic cointegration analysis reveals the existence of time-varying cointegration among the SEE markets and their developed counterparts, particularly during sub-periods that reflect the effects of common shocks such as a financial crisis. Therefore, one general conclusion we report is that both static and dynamic cointegration tests are necessary to analyse the extent to which international stock markets are cointegrated. The second question we address is whether any diversification benefits existed during the period that encompasses the recent financial crisis. We report that diversification benefits did exist from September 2007 to June 2013 despite evidence of dynamic cointegration during most of the crisis period from September 2008 to May 2010. Therefore, we suggest that any evidence of dynamic cointegration must be supplemented with evidence from a portfolio analysis before conclusions are made about the absence or existence of diversification benefits.

More competitors was expected to mean more competition, which was supposed to improve the efficiency of the sector. This choice was questioned by Deffains [20121 who showed that the introduction of Free would entail the destruction of 50.000 jobs. Conversely Thesmar and Landier 120121 expected from that measure the net creation of 16.000 to 30.000 jobs. These studies were focussed on the effect on employment. Here, we conduct a cost-benefit study that takes into account all the consequences of this measure to consumers, businesses and public finance. The arrival of Free has resulted in an annual increase of the consumer surplus of approximately 1.2 billion. This gain is offset by a loss of a slightly higher amount for producers. But it is accompanied by a loss of about (sic) 0.4 billion for public finance. In the end, the welfare impact of this decision is regrettable.

Institutional barriers may be one factor behind this gap, and recent research suggests that institutions are a greater obstacle to trade than tariffs. Using detailed firm-level data, we analyze how institutional quality in recipient countries affects exports by Swedish firms. Our results suggest that weak institutions in recipient countries make exports to these countries less likely and that exports to countries with weak institutions are characterized by relatively short duration and small volume. Analyzing long-term trade flows, we identified a learning process where exporters become less dependent on institutional quality in the target economy over time. More specifically, in addition to previous research that emphasize learning related to knowledge about the contracting partner and rule of law, we extend this notion and show that there is also a learning process where firms acquire knowledge about the general business climate. When learning about the contractual partner and business institutions in recipients countries takes place, exports increase relatively quickly during the first 2 years of exports and thereafter levels out. Hence, firms that are initially sensitive to weak institutions, start small, and learn how to handle foreign institutions are likely to be most successful in maintaining long-term relationships with foreign markets.","[Soderlund, Bengt; Tingvall, Patrik Gustavsson] Ratio Inst, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Soderlund, Bengt] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Soderlund, Bengt] Confederat Swedish Enterprise, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Tingvall, PG (通讯作者)，Ratio Inst, Sveavagen 59,Box 3203, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden.",bengt.soderlund@ratio.se; patrik.tingvall@ratio.se,,,,,,,47,20,21,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The rival option thus acts as a natural hedge. Within the industry, we obtain endogenous differences in expected returns.

Using a detailed dataset of monetary policy interventions between June 2007 and June 2012 in the most advanced monetary areas (the Euro area, Japan, the U.S., the UK and Switzerland), we analyze their effects at three different levels, including (1) the interbank credit market, considering the 3-month LIBOR-OIS spread as a measure of financial distress (e.g., Taylor and Williams, 2009); (2) the stock market, represented by wide equity indices; and (3) the banking sector, focusing on global systematically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs). We demonstrate that different monetary policy interventions from single central banks have produced a diverse market reaction. Standard measures have been more effective than non-conventional ones in restoring the interbank market, which is fundamental for maintaining a fully operational traditional interest rate channel and for guaranteeing the normal functioning of financial intermediation. Non-traditional measures have registered a stronger stock market reaction with respect to standard interest rate decisions, both in terms of broad equity indices and single prices of large banks.

Corridors are the essential link between these ports and continental hinterlands. Capacity expansions of seaport and corridor networks (resources), in conjunction with efficient transport services/operations (capabilities) are important to guarantee the attractiveness of a port corridor combination. This paper focuses on the attractiveness of three Southern African container gateway port corridors (Southcor, Natcor, and Trans-Kalahari Corridors), all contesting the same continental hinterland, namely, Gauteng. By means of a corridor stakeholder survey, this study merges the corporate strategy concept of resource and capability appraisal, with various theoretical principles of corridor attractiveness. The resultant adapted resource and capability corridor appraisal model is then applied to the three corridor cases in question. Consequently, this study presents an empirical framework which identifies each corridor's key strengths, key weaknesses and the extent to which each corridor is deemed 'attractive' by its stakeholders. Furthermore, this study reconciles theoretical assumptions of corridor attractiveness against actual perceptions of corridor attractiveness from surveyed stakeholders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that there is a significant short-term change in index returns following an increase in attention. Conversely, a shock to returns leads to a long-term change in attention. Given this evidence, we hypothesize that a change in index return or the sign of its return in the past can indicate the nature of the information that investors are paying attention to. Therefore, past returns should determine the impact of attention on the future returns and volatility. Indeed, we find significant interaction effects between lagged returns and attention. This result suggests that attention can alter predictability of index returns. Specifically, we demonstrate that increased investor attention diminishes return predictability and, therefore, improves market efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

PRs are a robust phenomenon that lead to suboptimal real-world decision making. Despite this, it remains unclear why PRs occur. This study investigated whether biological procedural invariance (i.e., different procedures are associated with different underlying mechanisms) could elucidate why PRs occur. Seventeen participants were scanned via functional MRI (fMRI) while (a) expressing preferences between 2 probabilistic wins or 2 probabilistic losses (1 high and 1 low magnitude) and, (b) reporting a monetary amount (valuation) according to how much they wanted to sell a potential winning gamble for or how much they would pay to forgo a potential loss. Participants' valuations closely followed expected value. Choice behavior, however, was more prone to bias because of unequal weighting of either magnitude or probability. Preference formation during both valuation and choice was associated with fronto-parietal neural activity. Within this system, valuation was associated with greater activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudal anterior cingulate cortex, while choice was associated with greater activity in the insula, horizontal inferior parietal sulcus, posterior cingulate cortex, and somatosensory cortex. The combination of behavioral and neuroimaging data may suggest that participants used a mathematical approach to formation of valuations but choices were subject to emotional influence. These findings may provide support for a biological procedural invariance view of gambling preference reversal. These findings are difficult to accommodate within explanations that rely on modifications to expected utility and prospect theory.","[Hinvest, Neal S.; Brosnan, Mark J.] Univ Bath, Dept Psychol, Bath BA2 7AY, North Somerset, England; [Rogers, Robert D.] Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hodgson, Timothy L.] Lincoln Univ, Lincoln, England",University of Bath; Bangor University; University of Lincoln,"Hinvest, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Psychol, Bath BA2 7AY, North Somerset, England.",n.hinvest@bath.ac.uk,"Rogers, Robert/AAF-7621-2019","Rogers, Robert/0000-0001-5010-069X; Hodgson, Timothy/0000-0002-0860-8892; Hinvest, Neal/0000-0001-7662-1039; Brosnan, Mark/0000-0002-0683-1492",,,,,84,6,8,0,9,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

According to the literature, this variability is mainly explained by credit and liquidity risk premia. I provide evidence that part of the variability might also be explained by ambiguity in the phrasing of the Euribor survey. The participants in the survey are asked at what rate they believe interbank funds are exchanged between prime banks; given the lack of a clear definition of a prime bank, this question might leave room for subjective judgment. In particular, I find evidence that some of the variability of the Euribor rates might be explained by changes in the survey participants' perception of what a prime bank is. This evidence adds to the difficulties already encountered by previous studies in identifying and measuring exactly the determinants of the Euribor rates. I argue that these difficulties are at odds with the clarity, simplicity and replicability that should be required of a widely used financial benchmark.","Bank Italy, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Taboga, M (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",taboga001@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,4,5,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

While this trend could make valuable contributions to an ailing agricultural sector, the alienation of rural land for commercial ends could conversely have far-reaching implications for customary land rights. Through an analysis of the legislation protecting customary land rights and governing such the alienation of those rights and by contrasting this with practice, this article highlights some of the fundamental challenges in translating legal rights into tenure security in contemporary Ghana. It shows that despite the legal recognition of customary land rights, in practice customary land users are ultimately responsible for contesting infringements upon these rights. With traditional authorities able to capture substantial rents from the alienation process and government institutions offering scant oversight as a result of fragmented responsibilities, capacity constraints, and political disincentive, the protection of customary land rights is becoming increasingly contingent on community 'capacity to claim'. Since poor access to information, unrealistic expectations and deference to traditional authority tends to quell disputes over alienation, the limited mechanisms for protecting citizen access to resources gives reason to reconsider the importance of direct state involvement in the customary land domain.","[Schoneveld, George Christoffel] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [German, Laura] Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Schoneveld, GC (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Forestry Res, Eastern & Southern Africa Reg Off ESARO, POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",G.Schoneveld@cgiar.org,"German, Laura/AAM-9934-2020","German, Laura/0000-0003-4943-4515; Schoneveld, George/0000-0003-1157-8222",,,,,51,33,36,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Therefore, disaster management is considered an important and common subject that requires great efforts. So continuous research is one of the important ways to establish the best methods to evaluate and develop the management of disasters and crises. Such methods are appropriate to deal with the suffering that many countries experience from natural and environmental disasters from time to time. This research aims to show the significance of disaster and crisis management in general. It also explores the current situation related to disaster response management in Iraq. This exploration focuses on the achievement of the basic functions of the management operation (planning, organizing, directing, controlling). In addition, it identifies the weaknesses and the strengths of the current administrative system in all its elements and analyses all the problems and the defects in every element, in order to treat and solve these problems and defects by making recommendations to improve the immediate response system to serve Iraqi disaster management in the future. In order to satisfy this aim, data collection included information obtained from literatures relating to disaster and crisis management. In addition, other information was obtained from a field survey of the directories of the civil defence in Iraq. Furthermore, collective and personal interviews with specialists related to disasters and crisis resulting from the war operations and terrorism were conducted. Analysis of the data results revealed many weak points in the current system and this was confirmed by the field survey. It showed us more clearly the areas where the weak points appear in the management function, especially in the planning and organization functions. One of the most important weak points is the absence of heavy equipment, as well as the shortage of specialist engineering staff and a dependence on assistance from other service departments. This is because of the local roles and the departmental management in the government. Finally, the study reached a set of conclusions and recommendations, including providing the directories of the civil defence with the heavy rescue equipment and providing specialist trained engineering staff to deal with the disasters and crises. Moreover, it sets in place an incentive scheme for the related members of the directories of the civil defence. Such schemes encourage them to continue working to face the unnatural circumstances that Iraq is experiencing and to create an environment similar to that of developed countries in the world. This contributes to overcoming the disasters of all shapes and reduces the damage to lives and property. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Today, in the context of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, there are initiatives for funding crop and livestock farms and entrepreneurship. Presently, there are bureaus offering consulting services and reliable information to the Greek farmers regarding Information Technologies adoption and innovative e-tools. marketing and processing of agricultural products, certificated agro-products (ISO), modernization of agricultural holdings, etc. Farmers have the opportunity to participate in EU funded measures that support the development of new activities, such as innovative actions, marketing services, new information technologies software and web tools and promote production innovations through specific investments. This paper aims to study and evaluate the adoption of consulting from livestock farms and discuss future opportunities. The study is based on primary data collected Tom the prefecture of Rodopi, in Thrace/Northeastern Greece, through a thrill management survey which was carried out during September and December 2011. At sample of 120 livestock farmers between the ages of 20 and 70 was surveyed for the empirical application of this study using a well-structured questionnaire. The survey took place in private consulting bureaus mid locally at farms. The collected data were coded and statistically analyzed using SPSS. Data was classified with cluster analysis in order to identify and describe groups with common attitudes among fanners. Findings show that 54% of the farmers in the sample are interested in consulting and adopt information technology solutions, marketing and entrepreneurship issues, aiming to sustainability in the context of EU goals. The results also indicate that 63% of the farmers have already participated in a program, while 37% have participated M the schemes promoting the establishment of young fanners. Moreover, 55% of them would prefer to be consulted by private consulting bureaus rather titan government consulting divisions. Private consulting bureaus satisfy forums who consider thern as a significant support in their attempt to achieve the contemporary ELF goals for sustainable development through the adoption of information technologies tools and innovative trade and marketing techniques. Farmers can be further classified in two groups that share similar either innovative or traditional aspects about Greek agriculture trends, in relation to theire social characteristics.

The article will analyse economic competitiveness of Slovenia, Greece, Malta, Cyprus, Estonia and Slovakia, since the adhesion to the euro zone implies giving up the exchange rate policy independence, with an impact on the possibility of further support for price competitiveness. The analysis of competitiveness before adopting the euro (in the framework of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II) will be made based on the market share within the European Union and on the effective real exchange rate. It is important to find out whether adhesion to the euro zone automatically brings an increase of exports competitiveness and an increasing market share within the euro zone for the member states. Competitiveness through the real effective exchange rate will be analysed through consumer prices indexes, the unit cost of work and export prices. The analysis underlines important aspects to be taken into account by every country that could adhere to the euro zone. The choice of the moment for the entry into ERM II is crucial for future candidates to the euro zone, as forcing an early entry could negatively influence their long term economic evolution.","[Anghel, Lucian Claudiu; Pinzaru, Florina; Dinu, Mihaela] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Coll Management, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,,lucian.anghel@facultateademanagement.ro; florina.pinzaru@facultateademanagement.ro; mihaela.dinu@facultateademanagement.ro,"Pinzaru, Florina/ABC-5633-2021; Anghel, Lucian Claudiu/AAP-9604-2021","Pinzaru, Florina/0000-0002-8371-5284;",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,39,48,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000004,0

The efficacy of prearranged Business Continuity Plans (BCP) in private enterprises becomes insufficient when disruption of common resources such as energy, water, transportation and communications occurs. Considering the recent increasing economic damages by disasters and recognizing the private sector as actor and partner of disaster management, the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (2013) highlighted agendas including private sector's progressively aligning risk reduction efforts and developing business practices, fostering new opportunities for public-private partnerships. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) started a project of disaster risk assessment and formulation of Area BCP, as a new concept of disaster risk management in industrial agglomerated areas based on recent lessons. The Area BCP is a framework and direction of coordinated damage mitigation measures and recovery actions of stakeholders including individual enterprises, industrial area managers, local authorities and administrator of the infrastructures in order for business continuation of a certain area as a whole. The Area Business Continuity Management (Area BCM) then generates the cyclic process of sharing risk information, formulating the Area BCP and implementing preparedness measures and effective recovery actions in case, in coordination among stakeholders, to improve the capability of effective business continuity in the area. The first Area BCM experiments were introduced in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam where are highly agglomerated by various industries and, at the same time, exposed to increasing risk of disasters. After the multi-hazard risk assessment and business impact analysis, the project identified dominant disaster types and possible scenarios of impacts on the area business continuity. Based on the scenario, the stakeholders, from private and public sides, are now formulating the Area BCP. We will report the progress of the project and current lessons from the practical management.

The proposed model determines facility locations and material flows between stages in each period. Numerical experiments showed the applicability and efficiency of the model. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Countries with more corruption tend to have worse infrastructure. At the regional level, the key result is unchanged. The magnitude and significance of this result is shown to vary by global region. Two stage least squares results, using distance from the equator as an instrument at the macro level support the simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

Particularly, Allah SWT destined Prophet Muhammad SAW to be a successful businessman before his prophetic life. Since Islam is a way of life, the code of conduct of marketing should be guided by Quran and Hadith, the two main references that Muslims adhere to in order to be successful in life and the hereafter. To date, the term Islamic marketing and its existence and acceptance remains an issue that are widely debated amongst academics, students, practitioners and consumers especially in the non-Islamic countries. Since there are arguments from scholars that Islamic marketing is significant in contemporary commercial activities, the concept of 7P's in marketing should be incorporated with Islamic principles. The concept of 7P's are selected due to its' wide acceptance as the core pillars of marketing. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop the understanding of 7P's based on both Islamic and contemporary perspectives of marketing. Thorough discussion pertaining to the mentioned issues will provide an in-depth understanding on each elements of the 7Ps. Furthermore, the integration of Islamic marketing and contemporary marketing can be seen as a new perspective to address the upsurge of interest towards Islamic marketing. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Decisions to alter products, menus, assortments and marketing strategies are drivers of supply, which interact with consumer demand to impact the nutritional quality of food available, purchased and eventually consumed. The sequence of managerial decisions leading to product-level marketing mixes is explored.

Consequently, the aim of this paper is the investigation of export performance and competitiveness in fisheries sector among Balkan and Eastern European countries. Using Eurostat data, the export trade is described for each country, regarding exports of fisheries products in the market of EU - 27. In specific, Greece presents a significant export trade in fresh or chilled Gilt-head sea bream, while Bulgaria in frozen sprats and snails (live, fresh, chilled, frozen, salted dried with or no shell). Czech Republic exports mainly live carp, while Hungary portrays a significant export trade in live freshwater fish. Finally, Poland shows a significant export trade in smoked fillets of pacific salmon, while Slovenia in fresh or chilled fillets of freshwater fish. The estimated Revealed Competitive Advantage (RCA) indices reveal a wide range of competitiveness among the countries examined. Therefore, the results of this study could help policy makers to probably reallocate the natural resources, reinforcing the national production activities in those species and potentially to develop a national strategic plan for the export marketing of the fisheries products involved.

As the financial crisis hits and resilience management financing cools down it reminds a sick person whose body temperature is too low. The degree indicated by the Recommender Thermometer for Measuring the Preparedness for Flood Resilience Management with a scale between T-min-34,0 degrees and T-max= 42,0 degrees shows either cool or overheated preparedness for flood resilience management. The formalized presentation of this research shows how changes in the micro, meso and macro environment of resilience management and the extent to which the goals pursued by various interested parties are met cause corresponding changes in the temperature of the preparedness for resilience management. Global innovative aspects of the Recommender Thermometer developed by the authors of this paper are, primarily, its capacity to measure the temperature of the preparedness for flood resilience management automatically, to compile multiple alternative recommendations (preparedness for floods, including preparing your home for floods, taking precautions against a threat of floods, retrofitting for flood-prone areas, checking your house insurance; preparedness for bushfires, preparedness for cyclones, preparedness for severe storms, preparedness for heat waves, etc.) customised for a specific user, to perform multiple criteria analysis of the recommendations, and to select the ten most rational ones for that user. Across the world, no other system offers these functions yet.

This is manifested in statistics on mode and distance of travel, which vary depending on a range of factors that operate at different scales. This heterogeneity is problematic for decision makers tasked with encouraging more sustainable commuter patterns. Numerical models, based on real commuting data, have great potential to aid the decision making process. However, we contend that new approaches are needed to advance knowledge about the social and geographical factors that relate to the diversity of commuter patterns, if policies targeted to specific individuals or places are to be effective. To this end, the paper presents a spatial microsimulation approach, which combines individual-level survey data with geographically aggregated census results to tackle the problem. This method overcomes the limitations imposed by the lack of available geocoded micro-data. Further, it allows a range of scales of analysis to be pursued in parallel and provides insights into both the types of area and individual that would benefit most from specific interventions.

Legal decentralization was not accompanied by fiscal decentralization, which involves financial aspects of transfer of public affairs to regional and local government. The degree of fiscal decentralization of certain government is estimated by the proportion of local government involvement in total revenues and expenditures of the general government and the local government share in GDP.

The major findings are: [1] renewable energy performs an important role for an increasingly significant share of Indonesia's energy mix for power generation in 2025 vision and [2] geothermal and hydropower are the main renewable-energy sources. Nevertheless, rather complex institutional and stakeholder arrangements in the energy sector have impeded the promotion of renewable energy. This study contributes on building the existing knowledge base on Indonesia renewable energy.","[Mappangara, Darman] Padjajaran Univ, Doctoral Program Business Management, Jatinangor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Warokka, Ari] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Int Carlos 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Universitas Padjadjaran; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Mappangara, D (通讯作者)，Padjajaran Univ, Doctoral Program Business Management, Jatinangor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.",darman68@gmail.com; ari.warokka@gmail.com,"Warokka, Ari/M-1314-2019; Warokka, Ari Ari/P-5066-2016","Warokka, Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780; Warokka, Ari Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780",,,,,20,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1906,1918,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300193,0

However, this trend brings the risk and the need for improving the orientation of people in the financial world. Due to the fact governments emphasise the importance of financial literacy as a tool for orientation in financial markets. The aim of this article is to analyse the behaviour of households in relation to their financial assets in European countries. In addition, this paper is based on a case study. This study describes the use of personal finance tools in the Czech Republic and analyses the existing products in this area. The method of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used for the evaluation of the types of personal finance software according to the chosen criterion. The AHP method helps to compare and evaluate personal finance applications according to the selected criteria. The results indicate whether households realise the importance of targeted management of their finances, and which tools are used for this purpose.","[Maresova, Petra; Polivkova, Lenka] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Maresová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",petra.maresova@uhk.cz; lenka.polivkova@uhk.cz,"Maresova, Petra/L-1743-2017","Maresova, Petra/0000-0002-1218-501X",,,,,17,0,0,1,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,241,250,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300022,0

Along with the benefits and opportunities associated with worldwide collaboration networks comes 'pathways along which dangerous and damaging events can spread rapidly and globally'. With our hyper-connected world underpinned by hyper or hybrid-risks, the impact of unexpected events such as floods, earthquakes, financial crisis, and cyber-attacks has revealed the fragility and vulnerabilities that lie within the social/technological/economic/political/ecological interdependent systems. In particular, events that affect critical infrastructure such as damage to electric power, telecommunications, transportation, health care systems, financial markets and water-supply systems can have local, regional and global impact. Taleb (2007) calls these extreme events 'Black swans' to describe their inherent quality of surprise. Many of the systemic risks that characterize Natural Hazard triggered Technological disasters (NATECH) often arise from unanticipated consequences of interactions within and between different types of systems. Johnson and Tivnan (2012: 65) argue that, '...understanding, controlling and predicting extreme behavior [of NATECH] is an important strategic goal to support resilience planning'. In this light, a new paradigm is required to support disaster risk reduction (DRR) embedded in hyper-risks; one that will develop not only anticipatory measures for risk management but also prepare for the unpredictable and the 'unknown' by building organisational resilience for hyper-risks in general and NATECH disasters in particular. In this paper we explore the emergency management domain associated with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident to show the hyper-connectivity and hyper-risks that permeated the problem space and thereby show how 'reflective responses' underpinned by 'critical reflective practices' can be used to support resilience in such a complex disaster.

We estimate that the adoption of subsidies for biotech employers by a state raises the number of star biotech scientists in that state by about 15% over a three year period. A 10% decline in the user cost of capital induced by an increase in R&D tax incentives raises the number of stars by 22%. Most of the gains are due to the relocation of star scientist to adopting states, with limited effect on the productivity of incumbent scientists already in the state. The gains are concentrated among private sector inventors. We uncover little effect of subsidies on academic researchers, consistent with the fact that their incentives are unaffected. Our estimates indicate that the effect on overall employment in the biotech sector is of comparable magnitude to that on star scientists. Consistent with a model where workers are fairly mobile across states, we find limited effects on salaries in the industry. We uncover large effects on employment in the non-traded sector due to a sizable multiplier effect, with the largest impact on employment in construction and retail. Finally, we find mixed evidence of a displacement effect on states that are geographically close, or states that economically close as measured by migration flows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We show that this argument is restrictive, since it does not allow for other ways of reducing production inefficiency, which creates the motivation for privatisation. If the profit maximising private firm is technologically superior to that of the welfare maximising public firm, the society and the private firm benefit from technology licensing. Under technology licensing, both the equilibrium output of the private firm and the equilibrium degree of privatisation are zero. However, if cost asymmetry cannot be bridged by technology licensing due to costly and/or imperfect technology transfer, the argument in favour of privatisation remains. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The concept of intellectual capital presents a comprehensive insight into different areas that are essential for the organization and its performance management. Over the past years, several methods have been developed to measure the intellectual capital of an organization. Through so called scorecard methods, various components of intangible assets or intellectual capital are identified and indicators and indices are generated and reported in scorecards or as graphs. They might be very useful at a company level as a basis for internal management information, especially in the connection with business strategy management. Although scorecard intellectual capital measurement methods are operating with indicators and calculations at business level what results in worse inter-company comparability, it is possible to watch and generalize some common trends. In our research, we investigate the level of management of different areas of intellectual capital by analyzing three different dimensions: perceived importance of individual parts of intangible resources in terms of achieving the objectives of the company, implemented knowledge management initiatives that contribute to build these resources and the management style of Slovak top managers (their focus on activities reducing company costs vs. activities building the future sustainable competitive advantage through investing into intangible resources). The research has been conducted within Slovak companies using face-to-face interviews with company owners, company directors or members of top management.

According to Epstein (2002) financialization refers to the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions and financial elites in the operations of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international levels. Its origin dates back to the reforms carried out in several countries during the last years of the 1970 decade, beginning a process of profound structural change. Lapavitsas (2009), states that the expansion of the financial instruments, more sophisticated means of communication and the progress in global economic integration provided the opportunity to agents engaged in the financial sector to get high returns made in the process of circulation of capital, to the detriment of other sectors. Thus, financialization represents a structural shift in the global economy in which the financial sector gains a greater influence on the overall economy. In addition, it is argued that this process of financialization of the CEE should be analyzed in the context of global-historical trends and that external agents played a key role in the determination of the direction and policies applied.","Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires,"Pataccini, L (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",lpataccini@gmail.com,"Pataccini, Leonardo/AAF-6501-2021; Pataccini, Leonardo/JCD-8268-2023","Pataccini, Leonardo/0000-0002-8436-1596",,,,,33,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,295,306,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500028,0

The Globalization Types Model is a proposal to bridge this deficiency. Having modeled the globalization of physical trade flows, the so-called type 1 globalization with its different logics of subtypes 1a, 1b, and 1c, the aim now is to describe the globalization of finance, i.e. type 2b, and to integrate it into the Globalization Types Model. This paper analyses the repercussion of financial transactions on the evolution of economic cycles. Due to the mutual interactions of different systems, the modeling is not based on state equations but on principles of system dynamics with its positive and negative feedback loops. It puts the emphasis not on equilibrium but on transition modeling, i.e. on the triggering of state change. The result is a cognitive model showing the influence and systemic effects of financial transactions performed on commodity exchanges causing increased volatility of commodity prices and the repercussion on the industry value-chain. The model links the speculative part of financial type 2b globalization to physical demand and trade flows of globalization type 1, capital investments of globalization type 2a, as well as human migration of globalization type 3a and unemployment.

Since the intellectual capital consists of human capital, structural capital and relational capital, and that human capital embodies the knowledge, the talent and the experience of employees, the structural capital represents encoded knowledge bases that do not exist in the minds of employees, and the relational capital represents the knowledge embedded in the organizational value chain. And for that we aims to determine whether relational Capital is presented and valuated in a company working in the logistics sector, and if it has an impact on the financial performance. Considering this, we have developed a Case Study that utilises a pragmatic and unique, holistic and exploratory approach. Data collection was carried out mainly through interviews and observation centred on Relational Capital and on the financial performance, conducted on two elements from different levels of authority and responsibility within the company, a director and an operation employee. A Likert scale of 5 points was used, and the study concluded that both participants interviewed, shared a similar point of view about Relational Capital and the financial performance. It was also concluded that the company evaluated is relational Capital, in particular, the follow elements: the culture and the organizational characteristics had impact in the financial performance of a firm, and the company had a positive result over the years, although yields have stagnated recently, and expenses have increased due to the current international crisis. Consequently, it was concluded that in those companies, Relational Capital was valuated and the case study suggests that there is a relationship with financial performance.","[Santos-Rodrigues, Helena; Pereira-Rodrigues, Guiomar] Polytech Inst Viana do Castelo, Dept Econ & Business Sci, Sch Technol & Management, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Santos-Rodrigues, Helena; Pereira-Rodrigues, Guiomar] Univ Algarve, CIEO Ctr Spatial Res & Org, Algarve, Portugal; [Cranfield, Desiree] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo; Universidade do Algarve; University of Southampton,"Santos-Rodrigues, H (通讯作者)，Polytech Inst Viana do Castelo, Dept Econ & Business Sci, Sch Technol & Management, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal.",hsantos@estg.ipvc.pt; guiomar@estg.ipvc.pt; djcranfield@gmail.com,"Cranfield, Desiree Joy/AGT-4346-2022; Santos-Rodrigues, Helena/A-8147-2012; santos-rodrigues, helena/M-7073-2019","Cranfield, Desiree Joy/0000-0002-3082-687X; Santos-Rodrigues, Helena/0000-0002-0442-4447; santos-rodrigues, helena/0000-0002-0442-4447",,,,,24,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,184,189,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000023,0

The attention is focused on single worker taxation with the average wage in 21 selected European countries, OECD as well as the European Union members. Importance of personal income taxes is not only in their financial contribution to the public budgets (in average, personal income taxes are the second most important source of tax revenues in line with Eurostat tax classification), but also in their impact on other government policies and goals (e. g. an economic growth, a redistribution, country's competitiveness, a functioning of labour markets or fiscal federalism) at the same time. Finally, paper explores relation between PIT share on total taxation and average PIT rate for a single worker with the average wage. Results indicate that increasing PIT share on total taxation by 1 percentage point increases the PIT rate by 0.57 percentage point. It confirms the importance of PIT rates for total tax revenues. Paper uses standard scientific method, e. g. description, comparison, analysis, synthesis. The OECD wage database, Taxes in Europe database and national statistical offices are the main data sources.

There has been scant research, so far, with regards to ethical behaviour in the tourism sector. In addition there are considerable voids with reference to the factors that are able to affect this type of behaviour. However, in Greece there is already a considerable number of hotels, which have obtained the Green Key certificate. Their managers do need and seek for the most optimum marketing channels to promote their competitive advantages. The present study aimed to offer a somewhat better understanding of future travellers' intentions to adopt ethical consumption when travelling. Intentions of future travellers to search, plan and actually visit a green hotel was examined. The examination included also consumers' willingness to participate in a boycotting against an unethical hotel and further spread their word against unethical hotel practices through discursive activities, such as petitions gathering, taking part in protest events etc. In addition, it was aimed to investigate the impact of attitudes and demographics on customers' intentions to adopt and perform the above mentioned ethical behaviours. With reference to intentions to stay at a green hotel, it was found that potential travellers seem more agreeable to express their willingness to stay at a green hotel than to plan or make an actual effort to do so. The usual in consumer behaviour gap between intentions and actual behaviour was established here once more. It was also found that travellers are very much willing to participate in a hotel boycotting in cases that the hotel under boycotting has been demonstrably reported for safety and hygiene scandals, child labour, cruelty towards animals and particularly barbaric exploitation of their employees. On the contrary, consumers were not found equally willing to participate in discursive activities against unethical hotels. In fact, all they were found to do is to discuss with their friends the possibility of getting engaged in a hotel boycotting. The results also indicated that better educated consumers expressed higher level of intentions to stay at a green hotel, to boycott and discursively act against an unethical hotel, than their counterparts did. Women were found more likely to participate in a hotel's boycotting and consumers of 35-44 years of age were found more likely to enhance discursive activities. Attitudes that concern green hotels seem to be able to influence moderately travellers' intentions to stay at a green hotel. Intentions are mostly effected by those attitudes that concern consumers' feelings that staying at a green hotel is favourable and desirable. Attitudes in overall were found to be more able to influence consumers' willingness to stay at a green hotel than their actual plans or efforts to do so. Attitudes seem to be able, to a lesser extent, to influence consumers' intentions to get involved in boycotting and discursive activities. These findings, if studied carefully, might very well be found useful to marketing management strategies in cases of green hotels or hotels, which would decide to go green in the future. The Green Key certification should become one of criteria used in searching and locating hotels either through internet or the agencies. In addition, enthusiastic testimonials of past customers might very well be incorporated in the communication campaigns of the green hotels. (C) 2014 The Authors.

By means of new technological achievements, the Easy Leasing product allows a more efficient and faster processing of the application for financing through leasing, and by means of intensive promotion allows better sales. The differentiation strategy used by VB Leasing relies on the process optimization through new technological achievements, and in this way achieves the differentiation. Easy Leasing allows improvement of business efficiency in the B2B segment and thus leads to the company's greater profitability. This service requires a more intensive Internet use for e-sales, and allows a reduction of the time necessary for selling the product. Due to market development and globalization, supply is becoming greater than demand; consequently, the role of marketing is increasing, with sales acquiring a vital role. The crisis impact on the leasing market is obvious, and its consequences will inevitably be reflected on the economic environment where leasing companies do business in the forthcoming period as well. If a leasing company wants to maintain its market share, all the company functions should be directed toward achieving the set goals. Sales has a central role in leasing companies, both from the aspect of implementing the business marketing concept and from the aspect of ensuring revenues for covering all the business costs and the remainder for business profit. The paper will also provide a review of the role of sales force, which is the link between the Easy Leasing product and final service users. The paper will use primary research among car dealers by means of survey questionnaire. Scientific analysis will determine their satisfaction with Easy Leasing, whether the innovative product singles the company out of the competition; it will also assess the new product's recognizability, all from the aspect of increasing the leasing company's business efficiency and an increase in its market share.","[Vujic, Slobodan; Vujic, Sasa; Abduzaimovic, Aida] Univ Vitez Travnik, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Vujic, Slobodan] VB Leasing BH Ltd, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",,,slobodan.vujic@unvi.edu.ba; sasa.vujic@unvi.edu.ba; aida.abduzaimovic@unvi.edu.ba,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,475,487,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000034,0

We argue that the insensitivity of food consumption to health shocks does not imply insurability but indicates that it is not a viable response to such a shock.","[Yilma, Zelalem; Mebratie, Anagaw; Bedi, Arjun S.] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; [Sparrow, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Abebaw, Degnet] Ethiopian Econ Assoc, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Dekker, Marleen] Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Alemu, Getnet] Univ Addis Ababa, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bedi, Arjun S.] Georgetown Univ, Doha, Qatar",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Australian National University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Addis Ababa University; Qatar Foundation (QF); Georgetown University in Qatar,"Yilma, Z (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.",debebe@iss.nl,,"Sparrow, Robert/0000-0001-8613-0495; , Anagaw/0000-0002-6489-335X",,,,,21,51,59,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In particular, a context that is rich in knowledge generates entrepreneurial opportunities from those ideas. By commercializing ideas that evolved from an incumbent organization via the creation of a new firm, the entrepreneur (human capital) not only serves as a conduit for the spillover of knowledge, but also for the ensuing innovative activity and enhanced economic performance through resource allocation. The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship brings together contemporary theories and thoughts of entrepreneurship with prevailing theories of economic growth, geography, and strategy and therefore explains not just why some people choose to become an entrepreneur, but also why this matters significantly for the economy and society.","[Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Lehmann, Erik E.] Univ Augsburg, Fac Business Adm & Econ, GBM & CCSE, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",George Mason University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Augsburg,"Lehmann, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Fac Business Adm & Econ, GBM & CCSE, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",erik.lehmann@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,"Lehmann, Erik E./AAB-4787-2022; DEL RÍO, MIGUEL ÁNGEL MONTAÑÉS/F-2359-2013; acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013","Lehmann, Erik E./0000-0002-4108-7523; Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762; braunerhjelm, pontus/0000-0003-0218-7924",,,,,100,1105,1254,72,609,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Duration between transactions exerts a positive influence on price changes, while increases in order flow and trade volume exert positive and negative influences, respectively. The liquidity component dominates the information measure, suggesting that liquidity considerations dictate trade timing. These findings are rationalized with reference to MexDer's organizational structure, specifically the affirmative obligations placed upon marketmakers to trade a minimum volume.

This paper studies the factors driving home equity withdrawal (HEW) at the household level using Dutch survey data. In the Netherlands, house prices were growing fast and mortgage expenses are to a large extent tax deductible. Expectations and perceptions do seem to play an important role in HEW. Withdrawers tend to be more positive about house price developments and - although having lower income - less concerned about their future economic situation. HEW can have a significant impact on both households and the economy, with most of the equity released being reinvested in the housing sector and only a small share used to finance consumption expenditure.

We find that this is unlikely. Equity bubbles are loud: price and volume go together as investors speculate on capital gains from reselling to more optimistic investors. But this resale option is limited for debt since its upside payoff is bounded. Debt bubbles then require an optimism bias among investors. But greater optimism leads to less speculative trading as investors view the debt as safe and having limited upside. Debt bubbles are hence quiet high price comes with low volume.

Taking advantage of the rich VHLSS dataset in Vietnam, in particular its three wave panel data (2002, 2004, 2006), we assess the magnitude of various formal-informal earnings gaps while addressing heterogeneity at three different levels: the worker, the job (wage employment vs. self-employment) and the earnings distribution. We estimate fixed effects and quantile regressions to control for unobserved individual characteristics. Our results suggest that the informal sector earnings gap highly depends on the workers' job status and on their relative position in the earnings distribution. Penalties may in some cases turn into premiums.

Using the G10 currencies and S&P 500 index futures, the empirical results present a high magnitude of spillover effects of currency carry trade markets. The empirical findings also show a significantly positive relationship between spillovers of currency carry trade returns and subsequent market returns. Furthermore, the results indicate that this relationship is stronger in bear markets than in bull markets.

Along the price dimension, our analysis reveals that interest rates increase with bank-borrower distance and decrease with the distance between borrower and other competing banks. Along the quantity dimension, we observe that more distant borrowers are more likely to experience binding credit limits. We also show that the quantity effects of bank-borrower distance are concentrated among less transparent firms. Our findings are consistent with pricing based on marginal costs that reflect information-based factors, and are in contrast to the established paradigm, where banks adopt spatial discriminatory pricing rules when lending to small-sized enterprises.

Using cross-country panel data on manufacturing industries, we find that labor market imperfections arising from labor regulation have a greater influence on capital intensity than do credit market imperfections. Less restrictive labor regulations are associated with lower capital intensity in manufacturing, especially in middle-income and developing economies and in sectors that either require more frequent labor adjustment or are more unskilled labor intensive. This suggests that stringent labor regulations can impose costs on labor use, thereby curtailing gains from trade based on factor-abundance driven comparative advantage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent evidence has highlighted that the first-order coefficients of quantile auto-regression of firm size decline across quantiles. Our theoretical results show that negative variance-size scaling is sufficient to yield a decline in quantile auto-regression coefficients if firm log-size is Laplace-distributed, conditional on size one period ahead. However, it is sufficient only for declining auto-regression coefficients for fast-growing firms under Asymmetric Laplace conditional log-size if skewness is decreasing with size. In other words, if the growth of large firms is less dispersed and more left-skewed, size is a disadvantage for the growth of fast-growers, but not necessarily an advantage for fast-decliners. Thus, size-related determinants of negative growth skewness, such as diseconomies of growth, market power, and managerial attention issues, impact on how the LPE is violated. Using data on Dutch manufacturing companies from the Business Register of Enterprises observed between 1994 and 2004, our empirical estimates of quantile regression models confirm the evidence of declining quantile regression coefficients for small-medium firms (20-199 employees) mainly in the right-most quantiles, and for the same subsample, we find that growth rates variance and skewness are decreasing with size. The theoretical propositions of the paper are thus corroborated.","[Capasso, Marco] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Capasso, Marco] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Cefis, Elena] Univ Bergamo, Dept Econ, Bergamo, Italy; [Cefis, Elena] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Sapio, Alessandro] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dept Econ Studies, Naples, Italy; [Sapio, Alessandro] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, LEM, Pisa, Italy",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; University of Bergamo; Utrecht University; Parthenope University Naples; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Cefis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dept Econ, Bergamo, Italy.",marco.capasso@gmail.com; elena.cefis@unibg.it; alessandro.sapio@uniparthenope.it,"Cefis, Elena/AAJ-3162-2020","Cefis, Elena/0000-0001-9960-4354; Capasso, Marco/0000-0003-2057-299X",,,,,55,9,9,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We estimate augmented Gibrat law-type dynamic panel data models using different techniques aimed at controlling for the potentially endogenous nature of public financing, namely the Generalized Method of Moments System, Fixed Effect Instrumental Variable, and Inverse Probability Treatment Weights estimators. The results of the estimates show that selective support schemes had a larger impact on employment growth than automatic ones, but only if they were awarded in the very early period of the recipient firms' lives. However, selective subsidies awarded to young NTBFs are rare in Italy, calling into question the capability of the Italian industrial policy to sustain the growth of the high-tech entrepreneurial sector.","[Colombo, Massimo G.; Grilli, Luca] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Giannangeli, Silvia] UniCredit, I-20121 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; UniCredit Group,"Grilli, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",massimo.colombo@polimi.it; silvia.giannangeli@unicredit.eu; luca.grilli@polimi.it,"范, 京/H-3271-2016; Grilli, Luca/K-6348-2017","Grilli, Luca/0000-0003-4550-9276; Colombo, Massimo G./0000-0003-0373-1565",,,,,72,32,33,0,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The most stable periods of the two crises for all currencies are the early phases of the GFC, while the first phase of ESDC exhibit the most cases of decreasing correlations. Finally, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc show evidence of safe heaven currencies across several phases of the two crises.

We show that large acquisitions are associated with significantly higher numbers of subsequent board seats for the acquiring CEO, target CEO, and the directors. We also find that, in the case of acquisitions, experience is more important than ability. Both value-destroying and value-increasing acquisitions have significant and positive effects on a CEO's future prospects in the director labor market. In addition to increasing our understanding of the director labor market, these results suggest that the ex post settling-up incentives thought to exist in the director labor market are weak for acquisitions.

The data are from a panel of 22 OECD countries over the time period 1985-2005. We find little support for intergenerational conflict in general; however, those who are close to statutory retirement age dislike public expenditure on families and education because, once they retire, they will have less income compared to their work income.

VATs are used by over 140 countries of the world, including every member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development except the United States. An investigation of the implications of border-adjustable taxes on the U.S. trade balance suggests that VATs positively affect trade competitiveness but with differing impacts by sector. These results do not necessarily extend to the conclusion that a U.S. VAT would increase U.S. exports; such a prediction requires economic forecasting and appropriate simulations. The present results do imply that the adoption of VATs by other countries appears to have benefited U.S. trade.

The objective is to evaluate whether a too-big-to-fail behavior has been present in the region. Surprisingly, we do not find evidence to support a higher fragility of large Latin American banks. Our results show that systemically important financial institutions appear to outperform others in terms of both cost and profit without the need of taking more risks. This result holds even in concentrated markets, i.e., where there are few dominant banks and many others with small size in relation to the market. A highly unequal banking market in terms of assets, however, is detrimental for the performance of smaller banks and it also decreases stability of the whole system. We conclude that regulators should deal with market concentration by reducing the size gap between large and small banks, instead of dealing specifically with systemically important banks.

Integrating insights from research on the social functions of emotions and the bio-psychosocial model as proposed by Blascovich and colleagues, we assessed threat and challenge responses to anger communication in a three-player coalition setting. Depending on condition, participants were confronted with an angry message from either their initially-preferred coalition partner or from both their preferred and not-preferred coalition partner. Results showed that this manipulation had an impact on the cardiovascular (CV) response of participants and their subsequent behavior. In the preferred player angry condition participants displayed a CV-pattern indicative of challenge while in the all player angry condition participants displayed a CV-pattern indicative of threat. Moreover, compared to threatened participants, challenged participants were more likely to switch coalition partner.

Both upturns and downturns display duration dependence: they are more likely to end as their duration increases. Downturns display also lagged duration dependence: they are less likely to end if the previous upturn was particularly long. These patterns are consistent with a boom-bust view of housing price dynamics, where booms represent departures from fundamentals that are increasingly difficult to sustain and busts serve as readjustment periods. Findings are robust to the inclusion of macroeconomic variables, which allow for the estimation of additional determinants of house price expansions and contractions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Characterizing monetary policy regime switches in India,EMERGING MARKETS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Monetary policy; Taylor rule; Markov regime switching; Inflation targeting; RBI's discretionary policy,EXCHANGE-RATE,"The past two decades have witnessed a worldwide move by emerging markets to adopt explicit or implicit inflation targeting regimes. A notable and often discussed exception to this trend, of course, is China which follows a pegged exchange rate regime supported by capital controls. Another major exception is India. It is not clear how to characterize the monetary regime or identify the nominal monetary anchor in India. Is central bank policy in India following a predictable rule that is heavily influenced by a quasi inflation target? And how has the monetary regime been affected by the gradual process of financial liberalization in India? To address these points, we investigate monetary policy regime change in India using a Markov switching model to estimate a time-varying Taylor-type rule for the Reserve Bank of India. We find that the conduct of monetary policy over the last two decades can be characterized by two regimes, which we term 'Hawk' and 'Dove.' In the first of these two regimes, the central bank reveals a greater relative (though not absolute) weight on controlling inflation vis-a-vis narrowing the output gap. The central bank however was found to be in the Dove regime about half of our sample period, focusing more on the output gap and exchange rate targets to stimulate exports, rather than moderating inflation. India thus seems to be following its own direction in the conduct of monetary policy, seemingly not overly influenced by the emphasis on quasi-inflation targeting seen in many emerging markets.

Using a unique dataset and program evaluation methodologies, this paper investigated the performance of share prices in response to the newly introduced outside director system in Korea, where family businesses have been dominant. First, we find that the positive impact of the appointment of outside directors on returns is observed only when the proportion of outsiders on a board increases significantly and their appointment is accompanied by the lead-and-lag effect of regulatory reforms. Second, the buy-and-hold abnormal return is more evident for independent firms than for chaebol affiliates, due partly to the high monitoring costs for cross-shareholdings among affiliates. J.

While the distribution of income has become more concentrated at the top, measures of multidimensional well-being at the top have decreased slightly over time.

Our empirical analysis shows that, assuming a benevolent government, a higher degree of central bank operational (economic) independence is associated with a lower probability of supervisory powers being entrusted to the monetary authority. We interpret this result as deriving from governments' fear of the risk of excessively discretionary monetary policy. However, there is evidence that - conditional on operational independence - central banks are more involved in supervision when they pursue tighter monetary policy goals (a specific aspect of political independence). Our interpretation is that the latter may represent a commitment to mitigate central banks' discretion in the monetization of financial distress. Our study suggests that CBI can be relevant, not only for its alleged effects on macroeconomic variables, but also in influencing policymakers' decisions on the allocation of banking supervisory powers.

We examine these claims in the context of tariff liberalization and the transmission of volatile international dairy prices into the Canadian market. The paper examines the implications for dairy farmer welfare, quota values, and the welfare of other agents in the economy. Given that the US dairy industry has interests of its own to protect, significant dairy tariff liberalization is not expected. With modest tariff reductions, the impact on quota values will be minimal. Likewise, the overall decline in producer welfare will also be small. Therefore, supply management, as a marketing institution, is likely to survive the TPP, but marketing boards may have to change their pricing policies in response to tariff reductions.","[Rude, James; An, Henry] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Rude, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",,,,,,,,32,10,11,0,10,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

On average, copycat funds are able to generate performance that is comparable to their target mutual funds, taking into account transaction costs and expenses. However, their relative success increased significantly after 2004 when the SEC imposed quarterly disclosure regulations on all mutual funds. We also find substantial cross-sectional dispersion in the relative performance of copycat funds. Free-riding on the portfolios disclosed by past winning funds and funds that disclose representative holdings generates significantly better performance net of trading costs and expenses than the vast majority of mutual funds. The results indicate that free-riding on disclosed fund holdings is an attractive strategy and suggest that mutual funds can suffer from the information disclosure requirements.

Not taking into account such characteristics can compromise calculation of loss probabilities, pricing of credit derivatives, and profitability of trading strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics of higher moments of changes in credit spreads of European corporate bond indexes using extensions of GARCH type models that allow for time-varying volatility, skewness and kurtosis of changes in credit spreads as well as a regime-switching GARCH model which allows for regime shifts in the volatility of changes in credit spreads. Performance evaluation methods are used to assess which model captures the dynamics of observed distribution of the changes in credit spreads, produces superior volatility forecasts and Value-at-Risk estimates, and yields profitable trading strategies. The results presented can have significant implications for risk management, trading activities, and pricing of credit derivatives. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we take the point of view of an-equity investor who wants to hedge the equity risk by taking positions either on the VIX index or on CDS indices. In deriving the hedge ratios, we consider the joint dynamic of variables taking into account mean relations, variance spillovers, and asymmetry, as well as correlation changes over time.

When the acquirer's CEO has previous experience in the target industry, the acquirer's abnormal announcement returns are between 1.2 and 2.0 percentage points larger than those generated by a CEO who is new to the target industry. This outcome is driven by the industryexpert CEO's ability to capture a larger fraction of the merger surplus. Industryexpert CEOs typically negotiate better deals and pay a lower premium for the target. This effect is stronger when information asymmetry is high and in bilateral negotiations compared to auctions. We also find that industryexpert CEOs on average select lower surplus deals.

Private firms represent an ideal testing ground because they are smaller, more informationally opaque, riskier, and more dependent on trade credit and bank loans than public firms. Based on a representative panel dataset that comprises private firms from all major industries, we find that business credit information sharing substantially improves the quality of default predictions. The improvement is stronger for older firms and those with limited liability, and depends on the sharing of firms' payment history and the number of firms covered by the local credit bureau office. The value of soft business credit information is higher the smaller the firms and the lower their distance from the local credit bureau office. Furthermore, in spatial and industry analyses we show that the higher the value of business credit information the lower the realized default rates.

This paper analyzes the presence of seasonal daily patterns in the VIX and S&P 500 returns series using a trigonometric specification. First, we show that, given the isomorphism between the trigonometrical and alternative seasonality representations (i.e., daily dummies), it is possible to test daily seasonal patterns by employing a trigonometrical representation based on a finite sum of weighted sines and cosines. We find a potential evolutive seasonal pattern in the daily VIX that is not in the daily S&P 500 log-returns series. In particular, we find an inverted Monday effect in the VIX level and changes in the VIX, and a U-shaped seasonal pattern in the changes in the VIX when we control for outliers. The trigonometrical representation is more robust to outliers than the one commonly used by literature, but it is not immune to them. Finally, we do not find a day-of-the-week effect in S&P 500 returns series, which suggests the presence of a deterministic seasonal pattern in the relation between VIX and S&P 500 returns.

Recent research suggests that preferences for copycat brands relative to more differentiated brands are generally lower. That is, consumers tend to dislike such imitation brands, because of psychological reactance. Three experiments provide evidence in support of the counter hypothesis that preferences for copycats, rather than being generally negative, critically depend on consumers' uncertainty. When uncertainty about product quality is low, people dislike copycat brands, but this preference reverses when uncertainty is high - despite awareness of the imitation tactics being used. We speculate that this preference reversal occurs because the familiar feel of the copycat is interpreted positively when being uncertain, but negatively when being certain. This double-edged effect of brand similarity has implications for preference theory, consumer decision-making, and managerial practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Recent microeconomic empirical evidence may lead to a more nuanced view: Especially the top-performing business owners are responsible for the value creation of business owners. Other labor market participants would contribute more to economic value creation as an employee than as a business owner. The implied existence of an optimal business ownership rate would thus replace the dictum of the more business owners, the merrier. We attempt to establish whether there is such an optimal level, i.e., a quadratic relation between the business ownership rate and economic output rather than a linear or higher-order relationship, while investigating the role of tertiary education. Two findings stand out. First, by estimating extended versions of traditional Cobb-Douglas production functions on a sample of 19 OECD countries over the period 1981-2006, we indeed find robust evidence of an optimal business ownership rate. Second, the relation between business ownership and macroeconomic productivity is steeper for countries with higher participation rates in tertiary education. Thus, the optimal business ownership rate tends to decrease with tertiary education levels. This is consistent with microeconomic theory and evidence showing that business owners with higher levels of human capital run larger firms.","[van Praag, Mirjam] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Ctr Entrepreneurship ACE, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Stel, Andre] Panteia EIM, Zoetermeer, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"van Praag, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Ctr Entrepreneurship ACE, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.m.vanpraag@uva.nl; ast@eim.nl,,"Van Stel, Andre/0000-0003-4512-654X",,,,,86,33,41,0,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper compares the predictive performance of the conditional country risk and the conditional residual risk in forecasting the direction of change in the return on the UK stock market index. The conditional country risk and the conditional residual risk are estimated using the bivariate BEKK-GARCH technique and the direction of change in the UK stock market index is modelled using the binary logit approach. Both the in-sample and the out-of-sample predictions suggest that, as a predictor, the conditional residual risk is superior to the conditional country risk. Our findings support the residual risk model while contradicting the traditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Moreover, our tactical asset allocation simulations show that when the conditional residual risk is used in conjunction with multiple-threshold trading strategies to guide the investment decisions, the actively managed portfolio achieves greater returns than the return on a buy and hold portfolio.

We show that there is a unique equilibrium in which both firms preannounce and overstate their future actions when uncertainty of demand is low. We find that firms choose higher real actions than the ones they would choose in the absence of preannouncements. Moreover, the real actions of both firms are single-peaked functions of their credibility. In a Cournot market, firms face a prisoners dilemma in which preannouncing lowers firms profits. If firms could commit not to preannounce, they would remain silent. In a Bertrand market, firms overstate their future actions to foster collusion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesize that privatization has an effect on FDI/FPI as the process of fostering private sector participation is often accompanied by liberalization reforms, and by allocations of substantial shares of newly privatized firms to foreign investors. Similarly, we expect FDI/FPI to foster privatization efforts as new capital inflows, technology and managerial skills that accompany FDI/FPI make the environment more prone to competition, providing governments with incentives to privatize inefficient firms that need to be turned around.

It examines several mitigating policies, such as improving the business environment, reducing tax rates and cost of starting business, and subsidizing entrepreneurial search and skilled employment. To be effective, policies need to target the most binding constraints to productive entrepreneurship. When the constraints are on the side of firms, search subsidies would be more effective in encouraging productive start ups than subsidies to skilled employment, although fewer entrepreneurs may choose to operate in the formal sector than under the latter. Both types of subsidies should be phased out with reforms of the business environment and improved labor markets.","United Nations Dev Programme, Mbabane, Swaziland",,"Brixiova, Z (通讯作者)，United Nations Dev Programme, Lilunga House,5th Floor,Somhlolo Rd,POB 261, Mbabane, Swaziland.",zuzana.brixiova@undp.org,"Brixiova, Zuzana/AAZ-4816-2021; Schwidrowski, Zuzana Brixiova/JXN-7692-2024",,,,,,24,18,23,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper utilizes the estimation of hedged portfolio value-at-risk (HPVaR) to illustrate the potential model risk due to inappropriate use of the correlation coefficient and normal joint distribution between index spot and futures returns. The results show that HPVaR estimation can be improved by using the conditional copulas and their mixture models to form joint distributions to calculate the optimal hedge ratio. Backtesting diagnostics indicate that the copula-based HPVaR outperforms the conventional HPVaR estimator at both the 99% and the 95% coverage rates. The conventional models obviously underestimate the HPVaR, especially under a 99% coverage rate. We then employ a bootstrap resampling technique to quantify and compare the magnitude of model risk by constructing confidence intervals around HPVaR point estimates. The results suggest that the risk management models should apply a smaller nominal coverage rate (95% instead of 99%) to avoid the model risk mentioned above. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The integration is valuable because farmers' choice of inputs depends on both the status of the soil and socioeconomic conditions. The study uses a stochastic production frontier in which the individual farm's distance to the frontier depends systematically on individual factors. We show the importance of including key soil properties and find that phosphorus has a negative output elasticity, suggesting that farms may be using the wrong fertilizer mix. Hence, the central policy implication is that while fertilizers are generally beneficial, their application needs to be based on better soil information. This highlights the importance of strengthening agricultural extension, increased access to markets and more diversified supply of production inputs.","[Ekbom, Anders; Alem, Yonas; Sterner, Thomas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Ekbom, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Vasag 1,POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",anders.ekbom@economics.gu.se; yonas.alem@economics.gu.se; thomas.sterner@economics.gu.se,"Sterner, Thomas/AGZ-2537-2022",,,,,,53,4,4,1,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Second, CreditWatch (CW) and Outlook (OL) announcements, after controlling for prior credit rating events, lead to significant CARs at the time positive CW and OL credit rating events are announced. Third, we extend prior results by showing that changes in CDS spreads for non-investment-grade credits contain information useful for estimating the probability of negative credit rating events. Fourth, we find that the CDS spread impact of upgrades but not downgrades is magnified during recessions and that upgrades and downgrades also differ as to the impact of simultaneous CW/OL announcements, investment-grade/speculative-grade crossovers, current credit rating, market volatility, and industry effects.

Other findings are: (i) while the long-run effect of inward and outward FDI on income inequality is clearly negative, their short-run effect appears to be positive. (ii) Long-run causality runs in both directions, suggesting that an increase in inward and outward FDI reduces income inequality in the long run, and that, in turn, a reduction in inequality leads to an increase in inward and outward FDI.

I show that a continuum of competitive transitional equilibrium paths exists, in conjunction with a globally unique balanced growth path, when a household's preferences are characterized by habit persistence in a growing competitive economy with exogenous fiscal policies, namely, income taxes and productive public spending. Indeterminacy also emerges in the socially efficient second-best allocation even when the government intends to internalize habit externalities, including jealousy and admiration, by introducing optimal time-variant income taxes and public capital services. Therefore, in the presence of multiple competitive equilibria and socially efficient allocations and in the absence of continuous exogenous stochastic shocks, self-fulfilling beliefs drive endogenous business cycles in these growing economies.

The high standard of evidence that is usually required in criminal procedure reflects this principle. Conversely, the established model of optimal deterrence that follows the seminal work of Becker (1968) shows that the two types of error are equally detrimental in terms of deterrence and thus it prescribes the minimization of the sum of errors with no primacy given to type-I errors over type-II errors. This paper explains that when the costs of punishment are positive, and guilty individuals are, on average, more likely to be found guilty than innocent ones, wrongful convictions are more socially costly than wrongful acquittals. This justifies the bias against wrongful convictions without resorting to any ad hoc assumption about the relative weight of the two errors.","[Rizzolli, Matteo] Univ Bozen, Fac Econ, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy; [Saraceno, Margherita] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Rizzolli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bozen, Fac Econ, Univ Pl 1, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy.",matteo.rizzolli@unibz.it; margherita.saraceno@unimib.it,,"SARACENO, MARGHERITA/0000-0003-3461-4863",,,,,56,30,34,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2013,155.0,3-4,,,,,395,411,,10.1007/s11127-011-9867-y,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,138NQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318515700011,0

But the evidence to date has been based on surveys (observational studies) and on subjective measures of expectations and performance, which are likely endogenous. Thus, the present study aimed to test the expectancy-disconfirmation theory of citizen satisfaction with public services using an experimental method. Participants in an Internet panel (N = 964) were randomly assigned to receive either low- or high-expectations statements from a hypothetical government official and to view either low- or high-performance street cleanliness photographs, in an online survey experiment. The findings are in line with previous research and generally confirm the core relationships in the theory, although the effect of expectations varied by age and political ideology. Because this study is a true randomized experiment, it provides better evidence than previous studies regarding the true causal nature of these relationships.

The research takes a comparative historical approach, specifically investigating the origins of the divergence of the rule of law between Jamaica and Barbados by focusing on the late colonial period (1937-1966). Using new data collected from archival research, state legitimacy is identified as the key factor that helps explain the divergent trajectories of the rule of law in Jamaica and Barbados post-independence. Going beyond state-based explanations of the rule of law, the analysis suggests that the rule of law not only depends on characteristics of the state, but also on characteristics of society.

A dictator can take money from a receiver's endowment. The money vulnerable to theft is constant across groups, and there is no threat of punishment. Any differential in the amount taken is due to considerations of the racial identity of the potential victim or to variation in receiver endowments. The results provide weak evidence that theft is impacted by inequality. However, racial identity significantly influences theft decisions.

This study investigates this claim by comparing effects of majority PE backed and other buy-outs at different levels of financial leverage on post buy-out increases in entrepreneurial management. We propose that PE can be used as an organizational refocusing device that simultaneously increases entrepreneurial and administrative management. We find that majority PE-backed buy-outs significantly increase entrepreneurial management practices. Furthermore, the increased financial leverage positively affects administrative management in management buy-outs. However, the effect of high financial leverage is larger for majority PE-backed buy-outs. These results support the notion that PE firms help buy-out companies develop ambidextrous organizational change: i.e. simultaneously develop entrepreneurial and administrative management practices.

Applying our methodology to a panel of 54-86 of the world's major commercial banks for a 13-year time span with monthly frequency not only allows us to closely match the list of G-SIBs; we can also use individual risk contributions to compute bank-specific surcharges: systemic capital charges as well as countercyclical buffers. We therefore address both dimensions of systemic risk - cross-sectional and time-series - in a single integrated approach. As the analysis of risk drivers confirms, the main focus of macroprudential supervision should be on a solid capital base throughout the financial cycle and de-correlation of banks' asset values.

In total, 30 exploratory semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify and describe the underlying thoughts and feelings that affect the individual investment decision-making behavior. Decision-making rationales are analyzed by means of open coding of verbal data. The findings of the in-depth interviews indicated that individual investors have numerous beliefs and preferences that bias their financial investment decisions. These biases reveal the design of the investor's mind rather than flaws of the investor's mind. This study suggests that an understanding of an individual investor's psychology would help in better comprehending the way the individual investment decisions are made. The value of this research lies in its methodology and analysis. Perceptions and beliefs of the financial consumer with regard to their financial investment biases have not been explored earlier, so this article contributes to new knowledge in terms of financial product buying behavior.","[Sahi, Shalini Kalra] FORE Sch Management, New Delhi 110016, India",FORE School of Management,"Sahi, SK (通讯作者)，FORE Sch Management, B-18 Qutab Inst Area, New Delhi 110016, India.",skalrasahi@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,48,58,4,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

In the latter case, large institutional distance discourages FDI inflows, but this deterring effect is diminished for destination countries with substantial resources.

The dataset includes 179 VC funds that invested in 2482 companies. We find that the level of public ownership shows a weak negative correlation with the likelihood of observing a write-off and that a higher public share is associated with a longer duration for the investment.

We find that TARP under-achievers have some, but not consistent, weaknesses in income production. These banks also are experiencing liquidity issues as customers, shut out of public debt markets, get bank loans through drawdowns of loan commitments. Unlike TARP under-achievers, TARP over-achievers' loans are performing well. Yet, liquidity issues (from low levels of liquid assets and core deposits and drawdowns of loan commitments) hurt the abilities of these banks to continue their lending.

In such instances, policy-makers may wish to offset the impact of the extreme event with monetary or fiscal actions. To measure the appropriate policy response, however, one must be able to gauge the severity of the extreme event in real time. The usual quarterly data supplied by central statistical agencies are of little use to policy-makers for monitoring effects of transitory events, as the data are available only with a substantial lag and the impacts of events lasting a few days or weeks may be obscured in time-aggregated data. However, technological advances of the past several years have resulted in new high-frequency data sources that could potentially provide more accurate and timely information on economic activity. Here we show that daily Canadian debit transaction volume data, and business-day debit and cheque transaction volume and value data can be used to investigate the impact on consumer expenditure of several extreme events: the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the SARS epidemic in the spring of 2003, and the August 2003 electrical blackout.

We examine the effects of not only the level of these risks but also their changes over time. One of the major findings is that among the political and financial risks, only the political risk is adversely associated with FDI inflows. Specifically, not only the initially low level of political risk, but also a decrease in the level of political risk helps to bring a greater amount of FDI inflows. On the other hand, lower financial risk does not attract FDI inflows, especially to developing countries. Among the various components of political risk, in the sample of developing countries only, it is found that internal conflict, corruption, military in politics, and bureaucracy quality are inversely related to inward FDI flows.","[Hayakawa, Kazunobu] Japan External Trade Org, Bangkok Res Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kimura, Fukunari] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Kimura, Fukunari] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Chunchon, South Korea",Keio University; Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia; Kangwon National University,"Hayakawa, K (通讯作者)，Japan External Trade Org, Bangkok Res Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand.",,"Hayakawa, Kazunobu/HZM-4324-2023; Hayakawa, Kazunobu/T-9427-2019; Kimura, Fukunari/AAX-8044-2021","Hayakawa, Kazunobu/0000-0003-0032-9060;","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330087, 22243023] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,19,77,87,1,70,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

J,"Hick, R",,,,"Hick, Rod",,,"Poverty, Preference or Pensioners? Measuring Material Deprivation in the UK",FISCAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,poverty; material deprivation; preferences; older people,,"Indicators of material deprivation are typically based on a two-part question, asking, first, whether respondents possess a series of deprivation items and, second if they do not whether this is because of a lack of resources or is by choice. This second subquestion, or enforced lack' criterion, is ubiquitous but its efficacy has been questioned by a number of authors. In an important critique published in Fiscal Studies, McKay (2004) claimed that older people were more likely than younger respondents to report that they did not want the items they lacked, despite their lower incomes, and also that the enforced lack criterion introduced a subjectivity which, in effect, required respondents to feel poor in order to be classified as such. This critique has potentially profound implications for poverty measurement. In this paper, we seek to address the question of whether, if we are to employ indicators of material deprivation for poverty measurement, we should include the enforced lack criterion or not. In seeking to answer this question, we draw on data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and present tests of reliability and validity on indices of material deprivation, with and without the enforced lack criterion. Using odds ratio and analysis of variance methods, we find that the inclusion of the enforced lack criterion provides a measure of material deprivation which is both more reliable, and more valid based on a subjective measure of deprivation as well as on a majority of more objective forms of deprivation. Amongst the remaining minority (ill health for both methods and income quintile for the analysis of variance method), the divergent results can be explained, at least in part, by the older age profile of respondents in poor health and on low incomes. Thus, while there are legitimate concerns about the performance of such deprivation indicators amongst certain subgroups in particular, amongst older people on aggregate the enforced lack criterion helps to distinguish between poverty and preference.","Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Hick, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.",hickr@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Hick, Rod/0000-0002-1218-0809",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,27,21,21,0,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We explored the relation between sustained attention, processing speed, and working memory and the participants' involvement in cognitively effortful energy saving behaviors. Results showed that the efficiency of the aforementioned cognitive mechanisms was positively related to the frequency of saving behaviors that required monitoring, integration, and inhibition to be implemented in daily behaviors and routines. The efficiency of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie our ability to implement energy saving actions might explain part of the gap between energy saving intention and energy wasting behavior. Ergonomic design of domestic appliances - reducing the cognitive demands of energy saving behaviors' - and compensatory training of the cognitive functions moderating the execution of energy saving behaviors can contribute to reduce energy consumptions.

Policymakers increasingly view entrepreneurial traits as a non-cognitive outcome important for economic growth. We use international PISA-2006 student-level data to estimate the effect of private-school competition on students' entrepreneurial intentions, measured by their occupational desire to manage a small enterprise. We exploit Catholic-Church resistance to state schooling in the 19th century as a natural experiment to obtain exogenous variation in current private-school shares. Our instrumental-variable results suggest that a 10%-point higher private-school share raises students' entrepreneurial intentions by 0.3-0.5% points (11-18% of the international mean) even after controlling for current Catholic shares, students' academic skills, and parents' entrepreneurial occupation.","[Falck, Oliver; Woessmann, Ludger] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Woessmann, Ludger] IZA, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Falck, O (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",falck@ifo.de; woessmann@ifo.de,,,,,,,57,23,26,1,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The following paper deals with the issue of using keywords which correspond to trademarks registered by a third party for advertising purposes through internet search portals such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Seznam, Centrum etc. (in principle web search portals). The objective of this article is to analyze decided cases dealing with the AdWords service issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union and compare them also with the attitude in similar disputes in the U.S. Within this knowledge it is necessary to determine the impact of these decisions on further national courts decisions of European Union member states. Moreover there is also legal impact on copyright law and responsibility of internet search engines deduced. The method of the analysis of courts decisions is used and the method of legal comparison is applied to different attitudes in similar cases. Where a third party uses a sign which is identical with the trademark in relation to goods or services identical with those for which the mark is registered, the trademark proprietor is allowed to prohibit such use if it is liable to affect one of the functions of the mark (particularly the function of indicating origin). Regarding to the liability of the Internet search engine itself, decisions of the courts in matters of Internet search engines in the European Union vary from state to state. Whereas the German courts tend to currently access the responsibility for the outcome of the search engines more freely, the French courts are often more stringent. Differently, we can say much more liberal, is the access of the U.S. courts to this issue.

In this framework, the welfare dominance of deposit contracts emerges under corner preferences. It is shown that aggregate uncertainty creates high price volatility of ex-dividend equity claims traded in a secondary market and the resulting consumption allocations offer less risk-sharing opportunities to risk-averse consumers than tailor-made deposit contracts. The contingency of early payoffs on depositors' withdrawal order reinforces the welfare performance of deposit contracts, whereas costly liquidation of productive long-term investments deteriorates their welfare performance relative to equity contracts.

While positive and negative reciprocity are observed in investment and ultimatum games, respectively, prior laboratory studies often neglect the effect of time delays that are common in real-world interactions. This research investigates the effect of time delays on reciprocity in the investment and ultimatum games. We manipulate the time delay after second movers have been informed about the first movers' decisions. We find that a delay is correlated with fewer rejections in the ultimatum game, but we find no effect of delays in the investment game. A follow-up study explores some of the processes that occur during time delay in the ultimatum game. We find delays correlated to increased reported feelings of satisfaction and decreased reported feelings of disappointment. Increased satisfaction is correlated to an increased probability of rejection, while disappointment has a more complex relationship to the probability of rejection. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The link may really be the result of a two-way causality: the effect may run from productive efficiency to the type of vertical organization (i.e. vertical integration or outsourcing), as a self-selection mechanism, or an effect from the organizational mode to the firm's performance may (also) be at work. This relationship is empirically investigated in a novel panel dataset comprising about 500 Italian MT builders, implementing two equations and instrumental variables for the two directions of causality. The evidence clearly indicates the self-selection mechanism of the most efficient firms in vertically integrated structures, while an effect from the organizational mode to the firm's efficiency is not supported.","[Pieri, Fabio] Univ Valencia, Dpto Econ Aplicada Estruct Econ 2, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Zaninotto, Enrico] Univ Trent, Dept Comp & Management Sci, I-38100 Trento, TN, Italy",University of Valencia; University of Trento,"Pieri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dpto Econ Aplicada Estruct Econ 2, Avda Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",fabio.pieri@uv.es; enrico.zaninotto@unitn.it,"Pieri, Fabio/AAB-8384-2020; Zaninotto, Enrico/HME-0987-2023",,,,,,47,22,23,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Despite widespread attention to sovereign ratings and bank ratings, no previous study has investigated the link in this manner. We find that sovereign rating upgrades (downgrades) have strong effects on bank rating upgrades (downgrades). The impact of sovereign watch status on bank rating actions is much weaker and often insignificant. The sensitivity of banks' ratings to sovereign rating actions is affected by the countries' economic and financial freedom and by macroeconomic conditions. Ratings of banks with different ownership structures are all influenced strongly by the sovereign rating, with some variation depending on the countries' characteristics. Emerging market bank ratings are less likely to follow sovereign rating downgrades during the recent financial crisis period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Econometric models of international trade can be applied for determination of significant variables affecting foreign trade. This information can be used to make decisions about distribution. In this article, major variable affecting the export of barley from Central European countries are analyzed. Also, their quantification is provided using the gravity model. Goal of this article is to describe the main variables influencing the export of barley and answer given research questions. For the analysis, which covers the period 1995-2012 were selected the following countries : the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Germany and Austria. Gravity model of barley export was estimated using panel data in two fixed effects specifications. The estimation method used was Least Squared Dummy Variable (LSDV) method. The gravity model estimates that the market size of the importing country affects exports to a greater extent than the size of the domestic economy. The second most important group of variables were the size of the export crop areas and yields of barley. Furthermore, transport costs as well as cultural and historical ties are statistically significant. The estimates that were found to have negative effect are the financial and economic crisis and barley price shock in 2008 and 2009. The models shows that there is no reduction of exports to non-EU countries for members of the EU. In contrast, the possibility to export to the EU countries was significantly reduced for countries that were member of CEFTA. Membership in the EU for the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary led to an increase of exports to Germany and Austria. The paper was prepared within the research project IGA 20121050 Spatial integration of regional markets for agricultural commodities.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bubáková, P (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",bubakova@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,8,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,20,34,,,,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300002,0

In assessing this broad spectrum of proclaimed policy goals with the outcome of biofuel mandates, subsidies, import barriers, binary sustainability standards, and indirect land use measures, we identify many perverse and contradictory effects. Most importantly, we show how biofuel policies established the crop-energy price link and hence the food-fuel trade-off, the contradictory effects of combining mandates with different subsidies, the various surprising welfare economic effects, and the various inconsistencies associated with binary sustainability standards and carbon leakages.

MSEs across private, public and non-profit sectors have been considered the collaborative paradigm of the 21st century to move beyond market and state failures (Austin 2000). Moreover, the agricultural and food arena provides a unique context to analyze managerial and policy decisions to undertake (or not undertake) MSEs. This is because agricultural and food chains face the highest number of urgent, interlinked wicked-problem issues that are scientifically uncertain, change over time and determine value conflict among stakeholders (Dentoni et al. 2012). Such issues include food security, climate change, deforestation, obesity, the use of technology in food production, violation of human rights and animal welfare.","[Dentoni, Domenico] Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ross, R.

At the regional level, foreclosure rates of the South and the West have a significant impact on workers' remittances in the same negative direction. However, foreclosure rates from the North Central and East Central regions do not appear to have this statistically significant impact.

The main results indicate that peripherally located entrepreneurship experts perceive their regions as in a worse position than centrally located experts in terms of finance access and physical infrastructure.

Based on secondary data and the results of the survey and semi-structured interviews, the authors realized that the cause-effect relationship between crisis and toxicity of management and employees exists in the Russian organizations and that looks like circulation with the links of crisis - toxicity crisis. Their interrelation can be very dangerous for the performance of the enterprise.","[Fedorova, Alena; Parsukevich, Anton] Ural State Univ Econ, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia",Ural State University of Economics,,dekan_2002@mail.ru; maria.menshikova@uniroma1.it; zdvorak@vse.cz; a030363@yandex.ru,"Fedorova, Alena E./E-5944-2013",,,,,,11,7,7,0,13,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,388,397,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100040,0

Further, using sub-samples of overinvestment and underinvestment, we find that overinvestment is more severe for large amounts of new debt, while the increasing of existing debt will significantly relieve this overinvestment problem.

Results show that, at whole farm level, the average financial gains in margin above variable costs from improving technical and cost efficiency amount to R21 335 and R21 581, respectively. Importantly, the gains represent potential increases of 246% and 249%, respectively, in margins above variable costs. Improving the levels of efficiency with which the farmers use their inputs thus may contribute substantially to increase the contribution of raisin production to the livelihoods of raisin farmers from Eksteenskuil. The close comparison of the potential gains suggests that the current emphasis of extension services on maximising output levels should be extended to also promote the use of inputs in cost minimising combinations. Farmer-to-farmer skills transfer has a major role to play in supporting the farmers to use their inputs in a technically efficient manner. Extension officers and other support services should pay more attention to developing the skills of the farmers to be able to select the least cost combination of inputs.","[Jordaan, Henry; Grove, Bennie; Matthews, Nicolette] Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Jordaan, H (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",,"Matthews, Nicolette/E-3678-2013; Jordaan, Henry/AAF-8722-2019; Grove, Bennie/E-5395-2015","Matthews, Nicolette/0000-0002-8975-9026; Jordaan, Henry/0000-0003-4845-1727; Grove, Bennie/0000-0002-5325-2637",WRC,WRC,"The research in this paper is based on research that was done for a solicited research project, Assessment of the contribution of water use to value chains in agriculture (Report No. K5/1779/1/12), which was initiated, managed and funded by the WRC.

The study used the descriptive survey design to collect the views and opinions of respondents working in KENGEN (Okaria) in Naivasha. The target population was 600 in which 235 respondents was the sample for the study. Presentation of data used descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages and inferential statistics used were using spearman's rank correlation coefficient and linear regression technique. Particularly, the correlation analysis was undertaken to test the hypotheses of the study. The findings established that there was a strong positive correlation between performance target setting and employee performance. The null hypothesis that there is no correlation between performance target setting and employee performance was rejected. The study concluded that performance contracting had a strong positive effect on employee performance in public enterprises in Kenya and thus need to ensure performance target setting is well organized and planned. From the findings the study recommended that performance target setting in performance contracting be expanded to cover all areas of the organization and be cascaded to all employees of the organization and that evaluation be linked to some incentive system so that performance can be sustained.","[Kinanga, Robert Ong'eta; Partoip, Samuel Kimnyak] Maasai Mara Univ, Narok, Kenya",,,rongeta@yahoo.com; skimparta@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,1237,1245,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200119,0

The harmfulness of corruption is dealt with in a number of studies, whether in sociological research papers or analyses aimed at demonstrating the negative impact of corruption on macroeconomic variables. But what are the causes of corruption and its proliferation? In general we can say that institutional environment plays an important role in this area. This paper aims to use dynamic panel regression model to demonstrate the influence of selected determinants illustrating mainly institutional environment on the perception of corruption. Compared to previous analyses, there is a significant difference in that time lag in the effect of individual determinants was taken into account here, and also corruption itself was included as one of the independent variables.

We derive two-stage analytic formulas and propose a general multi-period solution using a numerical lattice approach. Our analysis reveals that exploration actions are more important when the project is out or at-the-money (near zero NPV) and less important for high project values. In a multi-stage setting, exploration actions are important even for in-the-money projects, when follow-on actions exist that can enhance the expected value of the project. With path-dependency, early actions are more valuable since they enhance the impact or reduce the cost of subsequent actions. Preemptive controls affecting rare event (jump) frequency and innovations that introduce positive jumps are more valuable for firms with higher frequency of competitive threats involving low volatility.

Barriers to entry, briefly stated, are high in some lines of business and low in others. We therefore proceed by explaining self-employment entry into separate subgroups of high- and low-barrier industries. Higher entry rates typifying whites, relative to African Americans, are traditionally interpreted as reflections of the former group's greater personal wealth and human-capital resources. This consensus view, however, is simplistic: personal wealth holdings have no positive explanatory power for predicting entry into low-barrier lines of business. Our findings demonstrate, furthermore, that high educational attainment is a strong, positive predictor of entry into high-barrier fields, but not into low-barrier industries. Because industry context indeed shapes entry patterns, one-size-fits-all econometric models commonly used to predict entry into self-employment fall short.","[Lofstrom, Magnus] Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA; [Bates, Timothy] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Wayne State University,"Bates, T (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",lofstrom@ppic.org; Tbates7893@gmail.com,"Bates, Timothy C/C-9637-2010",,,,,,28,28,33,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In their opinion, the human population and economy are depleting the wealth of the Earth and pollutants and wastes are burdening the environment. However, the concern that mineral resources will be depleted is unsubstantiated. Environmental economics argues that a higher number of people and a higher income make resources scarcer on a short-term basis. For investors and entrepreneurs, higher prices represent an opportunity and an incentive to search for solutions. Many of them will not succeed in this search and they will bear the costs on their own. However, in a free society, the solutions are eventually found.

At the time of their construction, the bridges were designed for a much lower loads values than the actual value and considered gauges were lower than today norms prescriptions. Lack of adequate investment in infrastructure, long time these bridges have had to endure move load superior to the design value and overall size of the trucks. In this condition, injuries occurred in some of the bridges elements from trucks collision. Authorities prefer to build new bridges instead invest in rehabilitating old structures. A solution for bridges that do not meet the conditions of load level or clearance is destination changing. These old bridges can be used on roads with less traffic or as pedestrians and cyclists bridges. Giving bridges a new destination has advantages in terms of environmental protection, natural resource conservation, historical monument preservation and save money. Architectural monument preservation is achieved by the fact that these steel truss bridges show a moment in the evolution of design and execution of works of art.","[Malita, Mihaela; Bancila, Radu] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara,,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,217,222,,,,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400029,0

This work used the technical inefficiency variable Number of municipalities that participated in an amalgamation and a dummy variable for The newly-established-municipality form of amalgamation. Results show that these variables have an impact on the cost inefficiency of local public expenditure. Average efficiency scores in the two estimations carried out were 1.145 and 1.100.

Affliction sometimes reflected denial of access to formal health provisioning, but it was also produced by the conditions of labour, including capital's largely successful struggle to externalize responsibility for the reproduction of its workers. This paper discusses various moments in the making of affliction in the region: the development of endemic tuberculosis, the resurgence of malaria, famine-related paralysis and HIV/AIDS. These cases illustrate how affliction has been shaped by the weight of long-term structural relations of class in the organization of labour and by the contingent outcomes of immediate political struggles. They suggest that efforts to improve health in Southern Africa today must address persistent structural patterns that underlie the causes of the incidence of disease; these are also relevant to questions of land reform.","ISS, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"O'Laughlin, B (通讯作者)，ISS, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands.",brolaughlin@iss.nl,,,,,,,58,32,34,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The empirical findings indicate that in addition to socioeconomic characteristics, product freshness and cleanness tend to have positive effects on consumer willingness to pay a premium for organic watermelon compared to conventional watermelon. Whereas product size has a negative influence on consumer willingness to pay premium for organic lettuce, less insect damage to vegetables tends to have a positive effect. The study estimates the willingness to pay a premium for organic watermelon/lettuce compared to conventional watermelon/lettuce. The estimated mean consumer willingness to pay premium for 1 kilogram of organic watermelon is GH(sic)0.5554 (US$ 0.4575) and that of organic lettuce is GH(sic)1.2579 (US$ 1.0361).","[Owusu, Victor; Anifori, Michael Owusu] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Econ Agribusiness & Extens, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Owusu, V (通讯作者)，Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Econ Agribusiness & Extens, Kumasi, Ghana.",vowusu.agric@knust.edu.gh; kanifori@yahoo.com,"Owusu, Victor/GQA-8523-2022; Owusu, Victor/N-7114-2019","Owusu, Victor/0000-0002-5277-1128",,,,,48,52,55,1,46,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

We address this question by analyzing the relationship between interest rates and adopting the for-profit legal form, appointing private sector representation and traditional banking experience to advisory boards, and participating in more extensive for-profit networks. The results consistently indicate that a stronger for-profit orientation corresponds with higher interest rates for MFI clients. However, this does not contribute to greater profitability and therefore sustainability because the stronger profit orientation is also associated with higher MFI costs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Assuming imperfect mobility, we show that a spatial econometric specification can be directly derived from our theoretical model.

We then highlight the potential contribution that research with biological entities could make to understand the complex pedestrian behaviour and the enhancement of pedestrian safety during emergency/panic conditions. We also emphasise that understanding of behavioural similarities and dissimilarities between humans and animals is required for developing a good experimental design aimed to study collective behaviour.

For this purpose, appropriate assembly plants in given soil and climatic conditions, especially from an agronomic point of view and from the point of view of environmental protection are used. The achievable profit in terms of specific production focus differs by up to CZK 1,500 per hectare. The work includes analysis of agricultural land revenues in terms of the focus on the production of cereals, oilseeds and livestock. It analyzes value of returns on agricultural land using BPEJ. Main basis is certified methodology of calculation of the gross annual rent effect, for specific values of inputs of nutrients, plant protection products and technology costs. The model adjusts returns and costs of agricultural crops according to the current price and cost developments. The paper also evaluates the loss of gross annual rent effect due to incorrect sequencing of crops,\ especially on the basis of reduced revenues. Observed decline in gross annual rent effect due to improper crop rotation sequence may be up to 1900 CZK per hectare. With respect to the protection of the environment functions for nitrogen doses 50, 90, 100, 110 % are evaluated for given soil and climatic conditions. The impact of 50 % dose reduction of nitrogen is in the case of winter wheat on average 600 CZK per hectare.

We use historical data to quantify gains from availability of TIPS in the presence of other asset classes such as equities, commodities, and real estate. We draw a distinction between buy-and-hold long-term investors for whom TIPS fully displace nominal risk-free assets and short-term investors for whom TIPS improve the investment opportunity set of real returns.

We predicted that trait anger is associated with the decision to invest, whereas trait anxiety motivates individuals to avoid investments. We employed a six question survey, considering real life investment decisions, stock trend predictability and preference toward risk investments, and three hypothetic scenarios to measure the participants' risk attitudes in the area of finance. The results showed that trait anger predicted risky decisions: it was positively associated with the willingness to invest money in different kinds of stocks, preferring medium/long-term investments, and with high predictability assessment in the forecast of stock trends. Contrarily, trait anxiety predicted conservative financial decisions: it was associated with the decision not to invest savings, to hold interest-bearing accounts, and with low predictability of stock trends. In hypothetic scenarios trait anger predicted a medium risk portfolio and the decision to wait before selling both loss and gain investments, while trait anxiety was associated with the preference for a low risk portfolio and with the decision to immediately sell a stock both if it increases or decreases in value. These data are consistent with cognitive models of emotions, highlighting their functional utility and extend the knowledge of the relationship between personality traits and real life investment decision-making.

Studies of early mover advantages for new financial products provide mixed evidence at best. We find evidence of early mover advantages in the relatively young market for long-term care insurance (LTCI) using data that allow broad testing of financial performance. Product differentiation, individual lines exposure, firm size, and traditional health insurance experience also affect financial performance.","[McShane, Michael K.] Old Dominion Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Cox, Larry A.] Univ Mississippi, Sch Business Adm, University, MS 38677 USA; [Ge, Yanling] FNC Inc, Oxford, MS USA",Old Dominion University; University of Mississippi,"McShane, MK (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",mmcshane@odu.edu; lcox@bus.olemiss.edu; ymayer@fncinc.com,"li, jian/IAQ-2794-2023",,,,,,53,1,1,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We show that a monopolistic CRA pools sellers into multiple rating classes and has partial market coverage. This provides an opportunity for market entry. The entrant designs a rating scale distinct from that of the incumbent. It targets higher-than-average companies in each rating grade of the incumbent's rating scale and employs more stringent rating standards. We use Standard and Poor's (S&P) entry into the market for insurance ratings previously covered by a monopolist, A.M. Best, to empirically test the impact of entry on the information content of ratings. The empirical analysis reveals that S&P required higher standards to assign a rating similar to the one assigned by A.M. Best and that higher-than-average quality insurers in each rating category of AM. Best chose to receive a second rating from S&P. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
