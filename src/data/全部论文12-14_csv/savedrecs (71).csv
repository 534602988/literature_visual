This paper attempts to answer this question using data on the origins of the corporate sector in Chile to construct an empirical analysis of the contractual provisions included in charters of corporations in the 19th century. Our findings indicate that, even though corporate law at the time was silent with respect to governance rules and investor protection, a significant number of corporations were created and their shares traded. The empirical analysis of the corporate charters reveals that these contracts frequently included provisions favourable to outside investors and the use of these provisions is consistent with the predictions of a simple agency model.","Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Negocios, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Rojas, GI (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Negocios, Diagonal Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile.",gonzalo.islas@uai.cl,,,,,,,37,2,4,1,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Scotland's unique legal context offers new insights into the honour of men and women, replacing the received view that female honour was almost entirely about sexual honour and complicating our understanding of male honour among the middling sort. In contrast to studies that view the credit of men and women as principally contradictory, this study instead identifies significant points of both overlap and divergence in male and female reputation and discusses honour as a family matter. Unlike in England, levels of defamation litigation in Scotland remained high through the eighteenth century, and both the social composition of defamation litigants and the types of insult they brought to court remained consistent. However, the forms and settings of disputes over honour changed, reflecting the interiorization of conflict as the eighteenth century progressed.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Paul, KT (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,,55,15,15,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

However, modelling studies consistently have projected that climate change is likely to increase the intensity of cyclones and the related rainfall rates in the future. A precautionary approach to this possibility is to adapt to the adverse effects of the changing climate by improving early warning services for cyclones as a 'no or low-regrets' option. Given limited funding resources, assessments of economic efficiency will be necessary, and values for benefits are an essential input. This paper aims to estimate the benefits to households of an improved cyclone warning service in Vietnam. Choice experiment surveys with 1014 respondents were designed and conducted to inform this paper. The benefit estimates of the maximal improvements in a number of attributes of cyclone warning services (i.e. forecasting accuracy, frequency of update, and mobile phone based warnings) are approximately USD7.1-8.1 per household, which would be an upper bound estimate. Results from the marginal willingness to pay for the attributes suggest that investments should be dedicated to improvements in the accuracy of warning information and a warning service based on mobile phone short message.

Design/methodology/approach - The project was exploratory and a qualitative process involving interviews with key actors in the region was adopted. Findings - Members of the champagne industry adopt a range of views about the nature of value, focusing on image, reputation and perceived quality, but varying between an individualist approach (which considers that value creation lies with the proprietary brands) and a more collectivist perspective, which considers it is predominantly the result of the territorial brand. Research limitations/implications - Research into the organisation of territorial brands is just beginning; while merely exploratory this research suggests that issues around value merit further consideration. Practical implications - Actors within a territorial brand need to clearly negotiate how they view value in order to maintain coherence and a common message. They may also need to pay more attention to issues around brand co-creation. Originality/value - No research in this precise field has previously been carried out and this study highlights variations in the perceptions of key actors within a territorial brand.","[Charters, Stephen] Reims Management Sch, Reims Res Ctr Wine Pl Value, Reims, France; [Menival, David; Serdukov, Svetlana] Reims Management Sch, Reims, France; [Senaux, Benoit] Coventry Univ, Coventry Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England",NEOMA Business School; NEOMA Business School; Coventry University,"Charters, S (通讯作者)，Reims Management Sch, Reims Res Ctr Wine Pl Value, Reims, France.",stephen.charters@reims-ms.fr,,"Senaux, Benoit/0000-0003-1576-4372; Charters, Steve/0000-0002-9470-9269",,,,,44,12,14,5,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Challenges that PES schemes have to tackle are (i) environmental uncertainty and (ii) information asymmetry between the provider of the service (typically a farmer) and the regulator. Environmental uncertainty calls for action-based payment schemes, because of the more favorable risk allocation if the farmer is risk-averse. Information asymmetry, on the other hand, calls for a performance-based payment, because of the more direct incentives for the farmer. Based on a principal-agent model, we study the optimal combination of both, performance-based and action-based payments under conditions of environmental uncertainty and asymmetric information. We find that for a risk-neutral regulator a combination is optimal in the majority of cases and that the welfare gain of the combined scheme over a pure action-based (performance-based) payment increases with information asymmetry (environmental uncertainty). We further show that for a regulator who is risk-averse against fluctuations in environmental goods provision the optimal performance-based payment is lower than for a risk-neutral regulator. We quantitatively illustrate our findings in a case study on the enhancement of the butterfly Scarce Large Blue (Maculinea teleius) in Landau/Germany. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of COO, price, and content on purchase intentions are assessed. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected via the survey method in Romania and Greece. Using a random utility discrete choice model, the authors test five hypotheses. Findings - Overall, Romanian and Greek individuals are less likely to buy US pasta; nevertheless, the likelihood that US or Italian pasta is purchased increases when this product is made from durum wheat versus soft wheat. Differences in purchase intentions due to age, gender, education, income, and nationality are also found. Research limitations/implications - The results have important implications for international pasta marketers, as it helps them to better understand the perceived pasta value and to position this product effectively in Greek and Romanian markets. Future studies should examine wider pasta market segmentation in the Balkans. Originality/value - This study contributes to the value literature by providing a framework of perceived value of foreign food products. Also, addressing concerns expressed in the literature, this study examines the COO effects on purchase intentions in a multi-cue context, focusing on low-involvement food products such as pasta. Because individual preferences for COO vary widely, the need for empirical evidence to complement theory is critical, and this is the first study with regard to Greek and Romanian consumers' intentions to buy foreign pasta.","[Dumitrescu, Claudia; Nganje, William] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness & Resource Management, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Shultz, Clifford J.] Loyola Univ, Sch Business Adm, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Arizona State University; Loyola University Chicago,"Dumitrescu, C (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness & Resource Management, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",cdumitre@asu.edu,,,,,,,88,5,5,2,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Information collection on consumer perceptions is particularly relevant when developing market strategies for wine, especially so when local production and certification of origin play an important role in the wine market of a given district, as in the case at hand. Investigating and characterizing the structure of preference heterogeneity become crucial steps in every successful marketing strategy. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the sources of systematic differences in consumer preferences. Design/methodology/approach - The paper explores the effect of inclusion of answers to attitudinal questions in a latent class regression model of stated willingness to pay (WTP) for this specialty wine. These additional variables were included in the membership equations to investigate whether they could be of help in the identification of latent classes. The individual specific WTPs from the sampled respondents were then derived from the best fitting model and examined for consistency. Findings - The use of answers to attitudinal question in the latent class regression model is found to improve model fit, thereby helping in the identification of latent classes. The best performing model obtained makes use of both attitudinal scores and socio-economic covariates identifying five latent classes. A reasonable pattern of differences in WTP for Prosecco between ODD and TGI types were derived from this model. Originality/value - The approach appears informative and promising: attitudes emerge as important ancillary indicators of taste differences for specialty wines. This might be of interest per se and of practical use in market segmentation. If future research shows that these variables can be of use in other contexts, it is quite possible that more attitudinal questions will be routinely incorporated in structural latent class hedonic models.","[Thiene, Mara; Galletto, Luigi; Boatto, Vasco] Univ Padua, TESAF Dept, Padua, Italy; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Padua; University of Waikato,"Thiene, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, TESAF Dept, Padua, Italy.",mara.thiene@unipd.it,"Galletto, Luigi/AAQ-2756-2021; Scarpa, Riccardo/AAF-8435-2019; Thiene, Mara/H-1866-2014","Scarpa, Riccardo/0000-0001-6449-5389; Thiene, Mara/0000-0003-3265-5426",MRC [MR/K023241/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/K023241/1] Funding Source: researchfish,MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,39,13,16,0,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Productive contributions from such linkages might be particularly expected in China, where policy measures have explicitly supported and facilitated connections between URIs and firms to stimulate economic development and competitiveness. In this paper, we measure the performance impact of such knowledge spillovers in Chinese firms by using a variety of specifications, estimators, and robustness checks, including an instrumental variable specification that controls for endogeneity. We find more patent activity in Chinese firms with URI connections and enhanced firm productivity particularly from linkages with research institutions (RIs). Introduction of new products, processes, and new businesses is also positively associated with linkages with research institutions, as well as with linkages with other firms.","[Yasar, Mahmut] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Yasar, Mahmut] Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Paul, Catherine J.

Five new public canals and 23 private canal branches activated a major expansion of Manchester's waterfront, providing the majority of the manufacturing sites that enabled the town to become the world's foremost factory centre.

However, the success of this policy approach depends on both collective action and institutionalization. It is therefore important to evaluate collective action and institutionalization where the process of property rights decentralization is in progress. This paper presents a modified version of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) Framework designed to analyze the decentralization of property rights and the collective action of community members to obtain these rights. It describes a three-phased framework for analyzing: i) the government property right decentralization policy, ii) the stock of capital assets in the community required to achieve property rights by initiating collective action, and iii) the development of an informal institution for effective property right distribution in the community. Finally, to demonstrate its utility to collective action research, we present a case study application of our modified framework to the fisheries property right decentralization policy of the Bangladesh government and the subsequent collective action of a wetland-dependent community.

The murrain, which killed around 62 per cent of the bovine animals in England and Wales in 1319-20, had a tremendous impact within both the seigniorial and peasant sectors of late medieval agriculture. In particular, the pestilence, which decreased the overall population of dairy cattle, depressed the overall levels of milk supply available for human consumption. Is it possible that the bovine crisis of 1319-20, and the subsequent protein shortage, were instrumental in weakening the immune system of humans and making them prone to the pestilence some 30 years later?","McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",McGill University,"Slavin, P (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",,,,,,,,43,59,66,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

It also analyses the effect of these features on stock returns using monthly data for the London Stock Market over the period 1825-70. We find that stocks with unpaid capital earned a higher return, which is consistent with investors being rewarded for the risk of a call on their personal assets.

The present paper tries to close this gap by employing a new and unique dataset based on the German Community Innovation Survey, conducted in 2009. The main purpose of this paper is to test whether different types of eco-innovation (according to their environmental impacts) are driven by different factors. Beside a complex set of different supply, firm-specific, and demand factors, the literature on determinants of eco-innovation accentuates the important role of regulation, cost savings and customer benefits. We find that current and expected government regulation is particularly important with regard to pushing firms to reduce air (e.g. CO2, SO2 or NOx) as well as water or noise emissions, avoid hazardous substances, and increase recyclability of products. Cost savings are an important motivation for reducing energy and material use, pointing to the role of energy and raw material prices as well as taxation as drivers for eco-innovation. Customer requirements are another important source of eco-innovations, particularly with regard to products with improved environmental performance and process innovations that increase material efficiency, and reduce energy consumption, waste and the use of dangerous substances. Firms confirm a high importance of expected future regulations for all environmental product innovations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, it may be difficult and costly to assess and manage stocks at a finer spatial scale, and there is generally greater uncertainty about the size of substocks than about the aggregate stock. We use a two-patch, age-structured metapopulation model to compare the performance of global vs. area-specific total allowable catch constraints (TACs). The relative performance of these approaches, in terms of profits and risk of depleting subpopulations, depends upon biological, technical and economic parameters - in particular various kinds of uncertainty, aggregation of fish stocks, and the spatial dynamics of different age classes. Surprisingly, a global TAC is less risky when there is little mixing of the subpopulations, as long as target mortality rates are not set too high. The advantage of the global TAC is reduced when there is mixing and migration between the subpopulations, particularly when these dynamics are asymmetric. However, a regulator naive to the nature of the true spatial dynamics (and hence the spatially optimal target fishing mortality rates) may still be better off employing a global TAC.

A two-step econometric approach is adopted. A bootstrapped translog stochastic frontier that is a posteriori checked for functional consistency is used to assess technical efficiency and these estimates are put into a land-use model to assess the impact of productivity on deforestation. Analysis of agricultural census tract data suggests that technical efficiency has a U-shaped effect: both less and more efficient farms use more land for their agricultural activities and so have a positive effect on deforestation. However, the majority of farms in the BLA are on the ascendant slope, so that efficiency implies more deforestation in the BLA. The poor environmental valuation of the Brazilian forest, the uneven land distribution, and the problem of the de facto openly accessed forested and unproductive lands in the BLA could explain the U-shaped effect of technical efficiency on the conversion of forested land into agricultural land.

We empirically demonstrate that the size and structure of an author's local network is a significant driver of the popularity of videos seeded by her, even after controlling for observed and unobserved video characteristics, unobserved author characteristics, and endogenous network formation. Our findings are distinct from those in the peer effects literature, which examines neighborhood effects on individual behavior, since we document the causal relationship between a node's local network position and the global diffusion of products seeded by it. Our results provide guidelines for identifying seeds that provide the best return on investment, thereby aiding managers conducting buzz marketing campaigns on social media forums.

Researchers suggest that, besides the provisioning of food, fuel, and fiber, agroecosystems provide habitat, cultural, and regulating services. One type of agroecosystem that remains relatively unexplored from an ecosystem service perspective is home gardens. In this paper, we aim at advancing the understanding of the value of home gardens by conducting an assessment of home gardens ecosystem services. For the empirical analysis we use home gardens in Vall Fosca (Catalan Pyrenees). We identify and characterize the most important ecosystem services provided by home gardens, and conduct a valuation of the social importance of home garden ecosystem services. The methodological approach for this work included an in-depth literature review, participant observation, semi-structured interviews, a valuation questionnaire, and a scientific panel consultation. We identified and characterized 19 ecosystem functions and related services. According to our informants, home gardens provide a large set of ecosystem services, being cultural services the category most valued. We found that the most important ecosystem services provided by home gardens differ from those provided by other types of agroecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, there used to be few pre-launch visible data for potential consumers to gain brand knowledge and forge brand equity and, in parallel, for companies to anticipate brand equity and measure it until the products were effectively launched on the market. However, this context is now changing due to different factors among which: 1) new advancements in ICTs that have facilitated new web 2.0 platforms such as online brand communities that allow users to form opinions and associations of new products even before launch, and also because of 2) the pre-announcements of upcoming products in several industries (e. g., movie trailers) that are increasingly developing. Such new product preannouncements allow community members to form associations long before the products are effectively launched on the market. In this new context, it is now possible to measure brand knowledge at the community level, but also to measure community-based brand equity (CoBBE) before product release, as shown in this study.

Methodology: There have been used two main sources of data -Czech Statistical Office (CZSO) and Monitoring System Monit7+. It enabled us to do a research with application of instrumental variables, regression discontinuity design and conditional difference-indifference (with propensity score matching). Those methods have been applied on both projects under the grant calls and under the system project Educate Yourselves (Vzdelavejte se!). The data enabled comparison between years 2008 and 2009. Conclusions: The application of regression discontinuity design on the dataset from the CZSO shows that there was identified significant impact on sales 9 to 13 percentage points in the case of successful grant applicants. There has been found also higher impact on sales by regression discontinuity design in the call nr. 39 in comparison with calls nr. 35 and 60.

Design/methodology/approach - Respondents (n = 2,083) from Poland, Greece, Spain and The Netherlands filled out an online questionnaire in which the consumption of fresh fruit, sweet snacks, salty snacks, orange juice and dried fruit was measured as well as consumer self-reported taste preferences and personal orientations towards health, convenience, price and routine behaviours. Findings - A total of 29 percent of the total sample preferred salty tastes, whereas 21 percent preferred sweet tastes; 1 percent preferred sour tastes, and 39 percent indicated no preference. In contrast with the expectation that people who preferred sweet tastes consume more fruits and fruit products, the results imply that consumers with a sour taste preference consume more fruits and fruit products. In addition, consumers with a sour taste preference seem to be less convenience-oriented and have more routine behaviours with regard to fruit. In contrast, consumers with a sweet taste preference eat more chocolate bars and are more convenience-oriented. Research limitations/implications - The self-reported measurement of taste preferences requires further justification to be used as a measurement instrument, e.g. formulation of the items, different cultures and linkage with preferences based on sensory testing. Practical implications - These findings show that the sweet tooth hypothesis is much more complicated if we consider not only consumption, but also self-reported taste preferences. Originality/value - The paper explores self-reported taste preferences, the sweet tooth hypotheses and fruit consumption.","[Sijtsema, Siet J.; Reinders, Machiel J.; Hiller, Sabine R. C.

This trend primarily impacts food businesses and table olive processing firms. The study seeks to explore the major economic obstacles to the adoption of food safety systems in table olive processing firms. Design/methodology/approach - All 59 table olive businesses in the Aydin Province of Turkey were included in the survey. In an effort to remove extraneous items and demonstrate internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha was calculated for each variable. To better specify the economic obstacles to food safety system implementation, data were examined with exploratory factor analysis using principal component extraction and varimax rotation. Findings - Major economic obstacles that most prominently emerged from analyses may explain several key indicators including difficulties in employing well-trained personnel required for food safety systems, insufficient training facilities for employees intended to aid in the implementation of food safety systems, deficiency of infrastructure and other physical conditions, and deficient financial support from government and non-government organizations. Research limitations/implications - The study investigated only table olive processors. Future research should include analyses of consumer behaviors. Practical implications - The Turkish government must ensure implementation of food safety systems to increase public knowledge and accelerate government funds for the establishment of such systems in the food business industry. Originality/value - The study contributes to the positive perceptions of managers and their behaviors towards implementation of food safety systems in table olive processing firms. Since the paper is one of only a few dealing with this topic, it provides key clues for dissemination of food safety systems adoption at the firm level.","[Tunalioglu, Renan; Cobanoglu, Ferit] Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Aydin, Turkey; [Karaman, Ayse Demet] Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Dairy Technol, Fac Agr, Aydin, Turkey",Adnan Menderes University; Adnan Menderes University,"Tunalioglu, R (通讯作者)，Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Aydin, Turkey.",rtunalioglu@adu.edu.tr,"Cobanoglu, Ferit -/O-5959-2017","Cobanoglu, Ferit -/0000-0002-7706-2993",Adnan Menderes University (ADU) Scientific Research Fund,Adnan Menderes University (ADU) Scientific Research Fund(Adnan Menderes University),"The authors thank the journal's two anonymous reviewers and its editorial staff for comments on an earlier draft of the paper.

The focus is on the net health impact of risks and benefits on life expectancy, quality of life, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs). Design/methodology/approach - Focus groups were conducted in four countries (Iceland, The Netherlands, Portugal, UK). All sessions were audio-taped, transcribed and content analyzed. Findings - Current risk-benefit communication is perceived as asymmetrical, confusing, and often distrusted. Participants expressed a preference for more balanced and scientifically derived information. Information about the net health impact on both life expectancy and quality of life was found to be meaningful for food decision making. DALYs were thought too complicated. Research limitations/implications - Findings confirm the importance of incorporating consumers' viewpoints when developing communications about risk and benefits. The results provide insights into potential issues related to the communication of risk and benefit information. The limitations of the qualitative approach adopted in this study suggest that further research utilizing nationally representative samples is needed, which may explore additional metrics to communicate net health effects to consumers. Originality/value - Common measures for assessing both risks and benefits are expected to facilitate the communication of the results of risk-benefit assessment as part of risk analysis. However, research incorporating consumers' perspectives on this issue is scarce. A better understanding of how consumers perceive these measures may promote the development of more effective integrated risk benefit communication.","[van Dijk, Heleen; van Kleef, Ellen; Frewer, Lynn J.] Wageningen Univ, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Owen, Helen] Food & Environm Res Agcy, York, N Yorkshire, England",Wageningen University & Research; Food & Environment Research Agency,"van Dijk, H (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",Heleen.vanDijk@wur.nl,"van Kleef, Ellen/B-7789-2009","van Kleef, Ellen/0000-0002-8797-6983",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The research reported is funded by the European Commission and results from the third work package (WP3) of the integrated project QALIBRA, Quality of life, integrated benefit and risk analysis; Web-based tool for assessing food safety and health benefits (FOOD-CT-2006-022957).

The reducing interest of consumers towards beef and pork influenced unfavourably the home meat production which declined during the examined period. We are not self-sufficient in pork-production of which the negative balance of trading gives evidence, too. It would be effective to reinforce the level of the meat industry's vertical coordination in the field of transport, and search of connection between the meat industry's capital and the capital of primary producers and fodder producers.

This means that there are important synergies between climate policy and conservation policy. The highest rates of deforestation occur in tropical countries, where much of the land at the forest frontier is managed informally by smallholders and where governance systems tend to be weak. These features must be considered when designing policies to reduce emissions from deforestation such as REDD+. Deforestation is often accompanied by fires that release large amounts of carbon dioxide. These emissions are especially high in the case of peatlands which contain thick layers of carbon-rich matter. In this paper we derive marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves using data from a farmer survey in Sumatra, where rates of peatland deforestation are high. Comparing these results with farmers' stated willingness to accept payment not to clear forest to establish oil palm suggests that REDD+ policies may be more expensive than MAC estimates suggest The extent to which this is true depends on the types of soils being deforested.

Studies have shown a positive income effect on the intention to pay for environmental improvement. Perception of environmental risk, however, follows a different pattern of variation. This paper demonstrates a negative income effect, using data extracted from a cross-national social survey involving 36 countries. An inverse relationship is observed between people's reported income and their perception of long-term environmental risks associated with climate change, genetic modification of crops and the use of nuclear power. Lower-income individuals see the potential environmental consequences of these human interventions as extremely dangerous more so than the higher-income ones. Richer people are relatively less concerned about the long-term environmental risks. A possible explanation is that material insecurity reinforces the feeling of risk and danger. People living under more difficult economic situation are more vulnerable and see greater danger. A key implication of these findings is that concern does not follow the ability to pay. People facing higher environmental risks are potentially less able to afford risk reduction support despite that they are likely to be in greater need for it. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While self interests can increase usage, social interests, such as global climate change, can impact an individual's attitude toward energy consumption. This paper examines the tragedy of the commons using household data, and compares the impact of self and social interests in predicting electricity consumption. Using both stated and observed behavioral data, the results show that self interests have a greater impact on energy saving behaviors and electricity use. We extend the analysis to control for an individual's environmental concern and perceived behavioral impact, finding similar results, and supporting the notion that the tragedy of the commons occurs regardless of a person's perception or environmental concern. These findings may explain why pro-environmental attitudes do not necessarily lead to pro-environmental behaviors, and it contributes to our understanding of the motivating factors for energy savings and electricity use by examining both stated and observed behaviors. Policies aimed at electricity reduction may have a greater impact if they focus on private interests, such as pricing, rebates, subsidies, and taxes, rather than social interests alone.

(Brookings Papers Econ Act Microecon 1:187-267, 1992) (BHC) decompositions to ask whether recent robust growth in aggregate labor productivity (ALP) across 25 countries is due to lower barriers to input reallocation. They find weak gains from measured reallocation and strong within-plant productivity gains. We show these findings may be because BHC indices decompose ALP growth using plant-level output-per-labor (OL) as a proxy for the marginal product of labor and changes in OL as a proxy for changes in plant-level productivity. We provide simple examples to show that (1) reallocation growth from labor should track marginal changes in labor weighted by the marginal product of labor, (2) BHC reallocation growth can be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated with actual growth arising from the reallocation of inputs, and that (3) BHC indices can mistake growth from reallocation as growth from productivity, principally because OL is neither a perfect index of marginal products nor plant-level productivity. We then turn to micro-level data from Chile, Colombia, and Slovenia, and we find for the first two that BHC indices report weak or negative growth from labor reallocation. Using the reallocation definition based on marginal products we find a positive and robust role for labor reallocation in all three countries and a reduced role of plant-level technical efficiency in growth. We close by exploring potential corrections to the BHC decompositions but here we have limited success.","[Nishida, Mitsukuni] Johns Hopkins Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Petrin, Amil] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Petrin, Amil] NBER, New York, NY USA; [Polanec, Saso] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",Johns Hopkins University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Ljubljana,"Nishida, M (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Carey Business Sch, 100 Int Dr, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",nishida@jhu.edu; petrin@umn.edu; saso.polanec@ef.uni-lj.si,"Nishida, Mitsukuni/I-4890-2017",,,,,,33,10,10,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The truncation bound implies the inefficiency threshold for survival. Specifically, this paper assumes a uniform distribution of technical inefficiency and derives the likelihood function. Even though this distributional assumption imposes a strong restriction that technical inefficiency has a uniform probability density over [0, theta], where theta is the threshold parameter, this model has two advantages: (1) the reduction in the number of parameters compared with more complicated tail-truncated models allows better performance in numerical optimization; and (2) it is useful for empirical studies of the distribution of efficiency or productivity, particularly the truncation of the distribution. The Monte Carlo simulation results support the argument that this model approximates the distribution of inefficiency precisely, as the data-generating process not only follows the uniform distribution but also the truncated half-normal distribution if the inefficiency threshold is small.","[Lee, Sungwon; Lee, Young Hoon] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Lee, YH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",yhnlee@sogang.ac.kr,"Lee, Young/AFO-2829-2022","Lee, Young/0000-0002-1104-9446",,,,,18,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Within both scholarly debate and actual valuation exercises, the emphasis is most often on reconciling cultural and monetary valuation. Increasingly, as the valuation of nature gains momentum, proponents of the trend seek to relieve apprehensions by suggesting that economic valuation is entirely compatible with intrinsic and esthetic values. This attempt to mollify skeptics, however, misses the mark; regardless of whether or not nature may be valued simultaneously in cultural and economic terms, the social and environmental justice implications of monetary valuation remain. The purpose of this commentary is to clarify that much of the resistance to the economic valuation of nature is motivated by these justice concerns and that reassurances about the cultural value of nature do little to quell them. Several of the justice reasons to remain cautious of the economic valuation of nature are also elaborated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A combination of nonregime and the middle power analysis is applied to produce hypotheses about less-developed cases of regime creation in Northeast Asia. Among the attractions of such an approach are that (1) cases of failure to create international regimes as well as cases of success are important to understand the emergence of global governance institutions, and (2) the different roles of various state actors should be understood beyond hegemonic power. The explanatory power of this approach is illustrated by transboundary air pollution issues in Northeast Asia, chosen because the international relations literature has emphasized the development of European regional environmental cooperation and global environmental issues. The paper examines participation by the Republic of Korea (ROK) in both comprehensive and issue-specific environmental cooperative mechanisms to tackle transboundary air pollution. It concludes that the ROK as a middle power has played a promising role to initiate and lead some positive competition between member countries, but at the same time, it highlights challenges that need to be met for creating solid regional environmental cooperation.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Kim, I (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, 28 Rolling Green Dr, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",inkyoung@polsci.umass.edu,,"Kim, Inkyoung/0000-0003-0657-3304",,,,,48,18,20,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Drawing on extensive archival material and using current methodologies, this study suggests that the composition of society was vital in the development of international associations. This is particularly pertinent in a period characterized by warfare, religious fervour, and the rise of Jacobitism. Common allegiance to Catholicism and support for the Stuart dynasty in both Ireland and France provided a framework conducive to international cooperation, but the Irish who settled in France held both Catholic and Reformed beliefs, and were not necessarily products of the Jacobite movement. Migration and integration, and commercial practices and successes, were not determined solely by religious or political affiliation, but were influenced by the composition of society and the support and acceptance received by immigrants and traders therein. Through an analysis of the Franco-Irish case study, it is concluded here that the social context of mercantile activity was just as responsible as the political or religious climate in governing the development of international commercial relationships in this period.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Talbott, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,69,2,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Standard microeconomic production theory showing the transformation of inputs into outputs is extended to allow nondiscretionary environmental variables characteristic of educational production. Failure to properly control for the socioeconomic environment leads to inappropriate comparisons and biased efficiency estimates. We employ a conditional estimator that does not allow a school with a better environment to serve as a benchmark for a school with a worse environment. The results suggest that Australian schools are moderately inefficient and that efficiency increases for the quintile of schools with the most favorable environment. Further, efficiency gains are realized with increasing enrollment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The new DEA index allows homogeneity indicators to be measured for various vaccines in the same model, which enables the development of a composite index for the first year of life immunization cycle. In Brazil 2010, the mean efficiency score for the 26 states was 0.89 (0.14 SD). Eleven states were considered efficient, and eight of them were located in regions with a high Human Development Index (HDI) and small rural population, which reinforces the concept that regional and socioeconomic differences must be considered during immunization planning. To reach the frontier of best practice, each state should have an individual and attainable goal for vaccine homogeneity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Castro Lobo, M.

The literature indicates that a substantial fraction of admissions is potentially preventable and that nonprofit nursing homes are less likely to hospitalize their residents. However, the correlation between ownership and hospitalization might reflect unobserved resident differences rather than a causal relationship. Using national minimum data set assessments linked with Medicare claims, we use a national cohort of long-stay residents who were newly admitted to nursing homes within an 18-month period spanning January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2005. After instrumenting for ownership status, we found that IV estimates of the effect of nonprofit ownership on hospitalization are at least as large as the non-instrumented effects, indicating that selection bias does not explain the observed relationship.

We compare the effects of different rules of water distribution and communication on three types of group participants: farmers, water administrators and students. The power asymmetry in the location along the irrigation channel was the most important factor affecting players' investment and water harvest decisions. The introduction of rules of water distribution only weakly altered the effect of power asymmetry but communication and the ability to modify the rules did reduce the effects.

When is such collaboration feasible, and how should environmental displacement treaties be designed? We present a game-theoretic analysis. In our model, countries first decide on ratifying a treaty, and doing so commits them to helping other countries that face cases of environmental degradation in the future. The equilibrium analysis suggests that treaty formation is easier under conditions of mutual vulnerability than if some countries are at a greater risk of environmental degradation than others. Our most important finding is that contrary to the received wisdom, treaties imposing stringent demands on countries are easier to form than treaties that are easy to comply with. We also examine the benefits of using displacement treaties to build capacity for cooperation. We illustrate the utility of the analysis with a discussion of the Kampala Convention on environmental displacement and consider the potential for future treaty formation in Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania.","[Subramanian, Narayan; Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, 420 West 118th St,712 IAB, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,23,4,4,2,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We investigate earnings in Swedish cigar making around 1900. Strength was unimportant, yet the gender wage gap was large. Differences in characteristics, such as age and experience, and different jobs within firms, account for two-thirds of the gap overall, and the entire gap for piece-rate workers. Firms were as willing to employ women as men in the better-paying piece-rate section, and women were willing to take those jobs. In contrast, discrimination was extensive in the time-rate section. Men in this section benefited from greater outside opportunities and customary wages elsewhere. Theory holds that labour market discrimination will reduce profitability, and make firm survival harder, a proposition that has never been tested historically. We find that cigar firms that feminized their workforces most extensively were most likely to survive. Product market competition prevented firms employing (overpaid) men to any great extent. We argue that economic historians must interpret industry-specific gender wage differentials in the context of workers' outside opportunities, and in the context of product markets, which canand in this case didlimit firms' room for manoeuvre.","[Stanfors, Maria; Eriksson, Bjoern; Karlsson, Tobias] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Leunig, Tim] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, London, England",Lund University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Stanfors, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,,,,,,,37,6,7,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

It accounts for 10% of Pakistan's GDP. Major cash crops include wheat, maize, tobacco, rice, sugar cane, as well as fruits produced in the province. Since 2005 the province has faced great problems - the 2005 Earthquake, 2009 Terrorism (Talibanization) and the 2010 floods. All these have greatly affected the agriculture of the province. A survey was carried out in different districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). Farmers were randomly selected and questions were asked through a questionnaire to know the main constraints in their farming system, which has led to low yield production. All the respondents pointed out their main problems in their farming. Approximately 60% of the farmers did not have access to modern agriculture equipment and were still using traditional agriculture technologies in their farming. 10% of farmers in some parts do not have access to tractors. The results in the study indicated that only 30-35% of the farmers have access to seed drills. Only 15-20% have access to reaper windrowers. Only 10% of farmers used combine harvester in the whole province. There were only 2-5% farmer who adopted fertilizer band placement drills. Only a very small percentage of farmers had knowledge about and access to seed processing machines/units. All these indicated that the farmers have less information about, and less availability of, agriculture machinery in this province. Regular workshops for the farmers should be arranged to increase their knowledge and interest in modern technology. The government and other agriculture organizations should start subsidizing programs for the use of modern agriculture technology.","Agr Res Inst Tarnab, Peshawar, Pakistan",,"Ali, H (通讯作者)，Agr Res Inst Tarnab, Peshawar, Pakistan.",,,"Ali, Hussain/0000-0001-6468-3881",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,281.0,284,,,,,,4,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400033,0

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 24 value laddering interviews were conducted with people who had just purchased an item from the traditional menu at McDonalds. Individual reasoning for not selecting a healthier Weight Watchers' approved alternative was aggregated across the respondent set to form a summary map which pictorially displays barriers to healthier fast food choices. Findings - Consumers' choices not to purchase healthier fast food options were dominated by Self Direction type values and are heavily influenced by engrained perceptions that fast food is junk food. Practical implications - For the fast food industry, this research highlights that to help shift consumers' choices toward healthier alternatives, they need to reposition themselves as quick service restaurants that offer good tasting food that is both convenient and healthy. Social implications - For public policy makers, this research suggests a need to address the perceptions of personal relevance of obesity and diet related health issues. Originality/value - The valuable in-depth information collected via the value laddering process offers substantial insights into the unexplored area of barriers to healthier fast food consumption.","[Anderson, Katherine; Mirosa, Miranda] Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Mirosa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand.",miranda.mirosa@otago.ac.nz,"Mirosa, Miranda/L-2743-2015","Mirosa, Miranda/0000-0002-4476-3793",,,,,34,12,13,8,69,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Taking accounting of Jiangcheng College, China University of Geosciences as an example, this paper expounds the prominent problems in its practical teaching, and puts forward ideas of improving the teaching content within the hierarchical practical teaching system of accounting in independent colleges. After eight years of development, Jiangcheng College of China University of Geosciences has become a domestic independent college with certain popularity, and its practical teaching system construction of accounting has made certain achievements. However, the most prominent problem in the practical teaching system is that the practical teaching content still cannot fully meet the market demand for multi-level talents. The current training courses of accounting are mainly those popular courses such as the Manual Simulated Training of Accounting, Accounting Computerization Training, Tax Filing Training, and Audit Training. Although these courses have made certain contribution to the cultivation of applied talents and to the development of discipline construction, as the employers ask for more and more diversified and compound applied talents, the imperfectness of the practical teaching content of accounting practical teaching system has been gradually revealed. Therefore, it is urgent to further clarify the levels of the practical teaching system, and enrich and perfect the practical teaching content. The hierarchy of the practical teaching system should be con(1)sidered first, for the collocation and cohesion of these training courses should be based on the requirements of different levels, and different levels and steps should be integrated into a whole. Usually, the practical teaching system of accounting could be divided into three levels: basic skill level, professional skill level and comprehensive training level.","[Cheng, Hui-Ling; Wen, Ying-Jie; Yao, Yu-Jian] China Univ Geosci, Jiangcheng Coll, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Wuhan,,342395131@qq.com; 402537057@qq.com; beichangyao@163.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",1951-6851,,978-94-6252-008-0,ADV INTEL SYS RES,,,2014,107.0,,,,,,76.0,80,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BB0ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340893200013,0

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 59 public schools and day care centres in nine municipalities of Baixada Santista - Brazil were randomly selected. The sanitary conditions were evaluated by applying a validated checklist specific to school meal service. The questions were scored according to the health risks detected. A percentage of conformity to good manufacturing practices was calculated, than schools and day care centres were classified according to health risk in relation to the scores obtained for each thematic area addressed in the checklist and in relation to the overall score. Findings - It was observed that 62 per cent of the schools were classified as average health risk failing to comply with Brazilian legislation on food safety rules. The thematic areas that showed lower percentage of conformity to good manufacturing practices were: hand hygiene (33.9 per cent), pest control (3.4 per cent), food handlers (62.4 per cent) and food hygiene (65.4 per cent). The school meal service of day care centres presented higher conformity in the hand hygiene (p < 0.01) and the environmental sanitation (p < 0.05) than elementary schools. Practical implications - The data observed in our study highlight the need of an effective system to monitor and evaluate the hygienic sanitary conditions in Brazil. The implementation of HACCP system may be an option with good potential to produce safer meals in school environment, nevertheless, the prerequisite program must be implemented first. Professionals with expertise in food safety can act as consultants to the school meal service and may use the data from this study as a benchmark for interventions. Originality/value - This paper contain new information related the state food safety practices of Brazilian school meal service. It also presents the use of scores to determine risk. The use of health risk is a novel way to evaluate the food safety practices in school meals facilitating the implementation of corrective measures.","[Da Cunha, Diogo Thimoteo; De Rosso, Veridiana Vera] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Biosci Dept, Santos, Brazil; [Stedefeldt, Elke] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Hlth Care & Management Dept, Santos, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP),"De Rosso, VV (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Biosci Dept, Santos, Brazil.",veriderosso@yahoo.com,"de Rosso, Veridiana/P-4675-2019; de Rosso, Veridiana/B-7956-2012; Stedefeldt, Elke/N-5380-2015; Da Cunha, Diogo Thimoteo/Z-5011-2019; da Cunha, Diogo Thimoteo/H-1670-2013","de Rosso, Veridiana/0000-0001-7327-7471; de Rosso, Veridiana/0000-0001-7327-7471; Stedefeldt, Elke/0000-0003-1136-5374; da Cunha, Diogo Thimoteo/0000-0001-5928-9265",FNDE - BRAZIL; CAPES - BRAZIL,FNDE - BRAZIL; CAPES - BRAZIL(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors would like to thank all the participants of this study, Symone Ferreira and Fernando Villamarin for the review, FNDE and CAPES - BRAZIL study sponsors.",,34,5,5,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to enlighten the process through which the food supply chain firms come to donate surplus food-to-food banks. Design/methodology/approach - Surplus food and recoverability were defined as the key terms of the problem. In total, 12 exploratory case studies were conducted to segment the manufacturing and retail sectors, to assess recoverability in each segment, and to establish the protocols for descriptive case studies. A multiple case-study approach was used and 83 firms were investigated. Findings - The primary source of surplus food is shown to result from products reaching the internal sell-by date, i.e. the date by which manufacturers and warehouses must supply perishable products. Donation to food banks is found to be a relevant management practice in the ambient and chilled manufacturing segments and at retail distribution centres, while frozen food companies and retail stores are found to rely nearly exclusively on waste disposal. Research limitations/implications - The degree to which our findings are specific to Italy is an issue to investigate. Future research should target surplus food management in farming and food services, and assess the cost effectiveness of alternative management channels. Practical implications - The paper highlights the changes required to increase the amount of food recovered by food banks. It also summarises the steps for establishing a structured procedure for managing surplus food within firms. Originality/value - The paper offers quantitative evidence on a relatively untapped yet socially relevant topic, i.e. the upstream process of food recovery and donation.","[Garrone, Paola; Melacini, Marco; Perego, Alessandro] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Garrone, P (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",paola.garrone@polimi.it,"Cavicchi, Alessio/A-4477-2016; Perego, Alessandro/Y-8287-2019","Cavicchi, Alessio/0000-0002-7793-865X; garrone, paola/0000-0002-0953-5007",food bank Fondazione Banco Alimentare,food bank Fondazione Banco Alimentare,"The paper is based upon a research that was designed and conducted in cooperation with Fondazione per la Sussidiarieta.

The smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of the economy should be positively correlated with an increase of population health. Economic performance of a country influences the expenditures of health care. The rank correlation coefficient of 23 EU Member States between the rank of the gross domestic product per capita and the current health care expenditures per capita in 2010 is positive and very close to 1, what indicates, that between these variables exists a strong association. Also the Spearman correlation coefficient of the health care expenditures and health status is statistically significant but not so strong anymore. It means that the countries with the highest levels of the health care expenditures are not always rated so perfectly according to the health status of their population. More important for the self-perception of good health is the overall living standard measured by the GDP per capita.","[Megyesiova, Silvia; Lieskovska, Vanda; Gruellingova, Maria; Ponist, Peter] Univ Econ Bratislava, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Megyesiová, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia.",megyesiova@euke.sk; lieskovska@euke.sk; grullingova@gmail.com; peter.ponist@gmail.com,"Lieskovska, Vanda/AAI-4530-2021; Megyesiova, Silvia/J-1056-2018","Megyesiova, Silvia/0000-0002-6815-5629; Lieskovska, Vanda/0000-0003-0392-4877",,,,,9,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1034.0,1042,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700101,0

However, budget stabilization cannot work for a long time in the southern EU countries being permanently in recession. There are several ways how to lower the debt burden - higher inflation, various types of state bankruptcies, federalization of Europe and takeover of the debt by a common fiscal authority or an institutional solution that requires only minimal adaptation of the existing institutional structure of the EU. The latter one being a permanent burial of the excessive part of current debt on the balance sheet of the ECB. Under certain conditions it is possible to design this solution as non-inflationary and by exclusion of the risk of future moral hazard in public debt incensement.","Skoda Auto Univ, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto University,"Saroch, S (通讯作者)，Skoda Auto Univ, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic.",saroch@savs.cz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1468.0,1476,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700143,0

In this paper we will focus on the development of age-specific mortality rates in this cluster of V4 countries. On the basis of the modern approach for detection the outliers in R software there will be shown the possibilities how to detect the outlying years using the Principal Components method with the programmed code. We will show and capture the years in which the development of these rates were statistically significantly different. For the practical application we used the data about the numbers of x-year-olds deaths by sex and the exposure to risk from the Human Mortality Database (for the mentioned countries, i.e. the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland).

Design/methodology/approach - These differences are established on the basis of logistic regression analysis, using 38 innovation projects (18 F&B and 20 technology-based). Findings - Newness of the innovation project to the company, communication capabilities and market potential have a more negative impact on innovation project performance in the F&B than the tech-based industry. Especially functional upstream capabilities increase the likelihood of success in F&B, when compared to tech-based innovation projects. Practical implications - While functional upstream capabilities are important for success of F&B innovation projects, there is still room for improvement in order to deal effectively with newness of the innovation project to the company. Internalization of resources from the network and a balanced radical/incremental innovation project portfolio contribute to additional enhancement of functional capabilities of the F&B companies, improving their capacity to deal with newness. Through a larger focus on co-innovation with retail, F&B companies can improve their intra- and inter-firm communication capabilities to attain more consumer-oriented integration of R&D and marketing activities, improving the market potential of their innovations. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates that the previously identified critical success factors for innovation projects differ in impact and importance for F&B innovation project performance when compared to innovation projects in the technology-based industry.","[Tepic, Mersiha; Kemp, Ron G.

The integration processes that take place between Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia already resulted in creation of the Customs Union and Common Economic Space. During disintegration years the foreign trade of Kazakhstan was diversified, however, with the deepening integration the structure of foreign trade seems to become reoriented towards former dominant partner, Russia. However, it is likely that export opportunities of Russia increase, while Kazakhstani export to Russia did not increase as it was expected resulting in discontent of local producers and giving grounds for integration opposing views. Numerous foreign trade analyses were conducted thereafter providing some conclusions, for example, concerning common external tariff increase supported by majority of the studies. However, most of studies also provide contradictory data and conclusions regarding other issues. The paper provides analysis of various studies regarding influence of integration on foreign trade stressing the problem of discrepancies caused by differences in used data.","[Tulegenov, Spartak] Int Informat Technol Univ, Alma Ata 050040, Kazakhstan; [Macakova, Libuse] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",International Information Technology University; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Tulegenov, S (通讯作者)，Int Informat Technol Univ, Dzhandosov St 8a, Alma Ata 050040, Kazakhstan.",Nibelung_9@mail.ru; Macakova@vse.cz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1555.0,1564,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700152,0

Small companies are sensitive to even slight changes in the environment. Many little businesses failed due to too low demand, payment delays, high interest rates or changes in cost structure. Standard business plan duly defines the profits and costs; on this basis the income is derived. The problem is that all values are considered deterministic and the profit is calculated as a single value. To enhance this method the common practice is to define three scenarios: the most pessimistic, the most optimistic and the most probable and on this basis derive the baseline assumptions, however even with this approach it is problematic to consider all the possibilities. The main goal of the article is to present and discuss the impact of risk modelling and simulation methods at the first stages of business plan preparation. A case study presents two business plans: deterministic and probabilistic. The probabilistic model encompasses probabilistic assumptions regarding decision variables. The two presented models are compared; pros and cons of both models are presented. The result of the conducted research shows that using probabilistic model for first, simple calculations can help businesses to succeed.","Warsaw Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Social Sci, PL-09400 Plock, Poland",Warsaw University of Technology,"Walczak, R (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Social Sci, Ul Lukasiewicza 17, PL-09400 Plock, Poland.",rpwalcza@pw.plock.pl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1643.0,1653,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700161,0

Commercial companies, meanwhile, did not penetrate into this insurance branch, which is probably due to the advantages that trade unions had when dealing with adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Nevertheless, union-based unemployment insurance reached a lower level of development than other private social insurance schemes, like sickness insurance, perhaps because of the financial difficulties that economic crisis involved for unemployment funds. Also, unemployment insurance spread specially among urban and high-wage workers, although coverage rates in Spain were below those of other European countries with higher income levels. However, even in the latter private coverage against unemployment did not reach 10% of the working population. As in other European countries, Spanish unemployment union-funds implemented strict economic incentives to deal with moral hazard, but precisely this hindered the spreading of private unemployment insurance.","Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Hist & Inst Econ, Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany Econ & Hist Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Espuelas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Hist & Inst Econ, Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany Econ & Hist Econ, Torre 2-4A Plata,Av Diagonal, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",sergio.espuelas@ub.edu,,"Espuelas, Sergio/0000-0003-1771-6307",,,,,39,2,2,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Published academic literature focuses on return-on-investment as the gold standard for wellness program evaluation, and a recent meta-analysis concludes that wellness programs can generate net savings after one or two years. In contrast, surveys indicate that fewer than half of these programs report net savings, and actuarial analysts argue that return-on-investment is an unrealistic metric for evaluating new programs. These analysts argue that evaluation of new programs should focus on contract management issues, such as the vendor's ability to: (i) recruit employees to participate and (ii) induce behavior change. We compute difference-in-difference propensity score matching estimates of the impact of a wellness program implemented by a mid-sized employer. The analysis includes one year of pre-implementation data and three years of post-implementation data. We find that the program successfully recruited a broad spectrum of employees to participate, and it successfully induced short-term behavior change, as manifested by increased preventive screening. However, the effects on health care expenditures are positive (but insignificant). If it is unrealistic to expect new programs to significantly reduce healthcare costs in a few years, then focusing on return-on-investment as the gold standard metric may lead to early termination of potentially useful wellness programs. Focusing short-term analysis of new programs on short-term measures may provide a more realistic evaluation strategy.","[Mukhopadhyay, Sankar; Wendel, Jeanne] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ 0030, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Mukhopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ 0030, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",sankarm@unr.edu,,,,,,,30,5,8,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The article, therefore, focuses on the role of discrimination itself in encouraging ecological degradation. The Detroit region shows that racial and class conflicts can facilitate the shaping of the urban built environment as one population sub-group, largely white and upper-income, attempts to distance itself from another sub-group that is largely black, lower income, and considered a threat. The outcome is not only disinvestment and decline in the urban core, but also excessive suburbanization, as whites seek homogenous urban environments and use space to increase the distance between themselves and the black population. The study shows that the lack of cooperation and tolerance across ethnic/racial and class subgroups facilitates inefficient low-density and scattered developments, and excessive degradation of natural ecological systems.

To reduce the overuse of the very resources on which human life depends, protected areas have been developed worldwide. Typically, national states. NGOs and charities have funded protected areas, with limited investment from private companies. This paper analyzes one option to increase private investment: an international market for protected area certificates. Following a cost-benefit analysis, a three-stage coalition game is developed. The corporate dependency on ecosystems is modeled through the ecological footprint. By implementing instruments such as side payments, membership restriction and non-compliance penalties, the model shows that corporate environmental agreements reduce the individual cost of ecological protection and enhance social welfare. The findings are supported by a sensitivity analysis conducted for the German tourism sector in Zanzibar. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The evidence was gathered from a data-set of over a hundred in-depth interviews with individuals from business, communities, state and non-governmental organizations in several major forestry regions in the European and Far-Eastern parts of Russia. The respondents' views regarding the nature and effects of certification were wide ranging. Certification is associated with new and powerful tools that are an alternative to coercive state governance, which may become instrumental in ensuring law enforcement and sustainability. At the same time, the combination of commercial drivers behind certification and the lack of social controls may lead to the institutionalization of existing, not necessarily desirable, forestry practices. Our paper shows that the inconsistent outcomes of certification are highly related to path-dependent social institutions and local practices. The expectations for internationally-devised schemes aimed at establishing sustainable forest management can be easily thwarted by the behavior of individuals involved at the local level. Greater focus on low-level actors is required for effective realization of multi-level governance in Russian forestry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, medical and organizational factors change over time. For example, demand for different-sized bed rooms varies based on medical requirements and patient preferences. In this paper, we consider the planning of ward layouts over multiple periods using different approaches. The fixed ward layout models aim at minimizing either the number of demand violations or costs for installing fixed patient rooms. In contrast, the variable ward layout model allows for layout adaptations to satisfy demand. Thus, additional costs for the movement of walls have to be considered. The application of the different approaches as a decision support tool for hospital planners is explained. Hence, it can be derived in which settings the costs for adapting a layout do not exceed the benefits of such a change. Computational experiments demonstrate the applicability of the models for realistic instances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of extended default, countries kept promising high returns that attracted international investors again and again: financial autarky thus gave way to eras of high integration to global markets as measured by sovereign risk pricing.

Our empirical results reveal that organic certification increases agro-ecological practice use, although from a very low starting point.

Most researchers incorporating conservation costs into analyses have relied on estimates of landowners' opportunity costs of accepting a conservation agreement. Implicitly assumed in such studies is therefore that those who produce biodiversity (landowners) receive none of the surplus available from trade. Instead, landowners could use their bargaining power to gain profits from conservation investments. We employ game theory to determine the surplus landowners could obtain in negotiations over conservation agreements, and the consequent effects on conservation outcomes, when enrolment decisions are governed by continuous variables (e.g. the proportion of a property to enrol). In addition, we consider how landowner uncertainty regarding the opportunity costs of other landowners affects these outcomes. Landowners' ability to gain surplus is highly variable and reflects variation in the substitutability of different properties for achieving a specified conservation objective. The ability of landowners to obtain profits from conservation agreements results in conservation outcomes that are substantially diminished relative to when landowners accept investment at opportunity costs. Uncertainty increases landowner profits, leading to a greater diminution in conservation benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that plots using wastewater containing organic nutrients earn lower profits than those using groundwater. We also find that the profitability of plots using wastewater is negatively affected by the presence of heavy metals such as Lead and Mercury that are carried through untreated sewage-water canals and deposited in the soil. Of the two opposing effects of wastewater irrigation, the negative effect of heavy metal toxicity outweighs the positive effects of organic nutrients. The results support regulation of the discharge of the heavy metals like Lead and Mercury into the wastewater from households and industries.

Alternative development paths, driving forces and sectoral contributions in different scenarios have been explored. The scenarios are quantified by using decomposition analysis as a Divisia Index SCenario GENerator (DISCGEN). The driving forces of population, economic and social development, energy resources and technology and governance and policies are discussed. A set of four integrated or 'hybrid' qualitative and quantitative baseline emission scenarios are developed. It is found that sectoral contributions and emissions in each scenario vary significantly. The inclusion of governance, social and cultural driving forces are important in determining alternative development paths and sustainability is crucial. Our empirical results show that decomposition analysis is a useful technique to generate the alternative scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple studies show that available drugs should be used in a socially optimal way to contain drug resistance. This paper studies the tradeoff between risk of drug resistance and operational costs when using multiple drugs for a specific disease. Using a model for disease transmission and resistance spread, we show that treatment with multiple drugs, on a population level, results in better resistance-related health outcomes, but more interestingly, the marginal benefit decreases as the number of drugs used increases. We compare this benefit with the corresponding change in procurement and safety stock holding costs that result from higher drug variety in the supply chain. Using a large-scale simulation based on malaria transmission dynamics, we show that disease prevalence seems to be a less important factor when deciding the optimal width of drug assortment, compared to the duration of one episode of the disease and the price of the drug(s) used. Our analysis shows that under a wide variety of scenarios for disease prevalence and drug cost, it is optimal to simultaneously deploy multiple drugs in the population. If the drug price is high, large volume purchasing discounts are available, and disease prevalence is high, it may be optimal to use only one drug. Our model lends insights to policy makers into the socially optimal size of drug assortment for a given context. (C) 2013 The Authors.

We estimate both the direct and indirect effects of government spending on pollution. The indirect effect in particular operates through the impact of government spending on income and the subsequent effect of the income level on pollution. To take into account the dynamic nature and the potential endogeneity in the relationships examined, appropriate econometric methods are used. For SO2, government spending is estimated to have a negative direct impact on per capita emissions, while the direct effect is insignificant on CO2 pollution. The indirect effect on SO2 is negative for low income levels and becomes poSitive as income increases, while it remains negative for CO2 for the most part of the sample range. The resultant total effects follow the patterns of the indirect effects, which dominate their respective direct ones for each pollutant. Policy implications from the results vary depending on the income level of the considered countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We review studies that address the role of economic factors in the emergence/spread of infectious diseases and identify three broad themes. First, the process of macroeconomic growth leads to environmental encroaching, which is related to the emergence of infectious diseases. Second, there are mutually reinforcing processes associated with the emergence/spread of infectious diseases. For example, diseases can cause significant economic damages, which in turn may create the conditions for further spread. In addition, the existence of a mutually reinforcing relationship between global trade and macroeconomic growth amplifies the emergence/spread of infectious diseases. Third, micro-economic approaches to infectious disease point to the adaptivity of human behaviour, which simultaneously shapes the course of epidemics and responds to it. Most of the applied research has focused on the first two aspects, and to a lesser extent on the third aspect. In this respect, there is a lack of empirical research aimed at characterising the behavioural component following a disease outbreak. Future research should seek to fill this gap and develop hierarchical econometric models capable of integrating both macro and micro-economic processes into disease ecology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Given the embedded multi-dimensionality of sustainability, systemic approaches are needed that can cope with interactions of different dimensions. Past efforts for measuring sustainability holistically have taken an accounting approach based on the availability and efficiency of resource flows. However, an accounting approach fails to fully incorporate the intensive parameters pertaining to sustainability. An ecological information-based approach is a promising holistic measurement which incorporates both intensive and extensive dimensions of sustainability. This paper evaluates this approach by applying it to six economic resource trade flow networks: virtual water, oil, world commodity, OECD + BRIC commodity, OECD + BRIC foreign direct investment, and iron and steel. From the perspective of biomimicry, it appears that these networks can achieve higher levels of efficiency without weakening their robustness to resource delivery. The trends of measured efficiency and redundancy of the studied networks are demonstrated to be useful in reflecting long term changes while the trend in robustness levels were found to exhibit similar behavior to an ecosystem in its early phase of development.

Equilibrium outcomes in game models of a focal action situation may not be explainable without considering linked games. The concepts of an 'ecology of games', 'nested games' or economic network analysis indicate the relevance of this move, but a structured approach to heterogeneous networks of adjacent action situations encountered in resource and infrastructure governance has only recently been developed. This paper draws on the adjacency concept and proposes four types of links, a potential boundary for adjacency networks, and a condition for bidirectional causation between linked action situations. The relevance of the theoretical propositions laid out is empirically supported for the analysis of electricity governance of irrigation in Andhra Pradesh. The actual and empirically observed outcomes, as well as the potential capacity of an adjacent action situation to influence focal outcomes, are analysed through a set of stylised game theory models and their links.

Predation spillovers refer to the net economic value of predation, taking into account the impacts on prey. Inefficiencies arise when the species interactions that generate this value are not managed to maximize the net economic surplus generated by the system. Consumptive values for predator and/or prey harvests factor into the value of predation spillovers in prior work. In contrast, we examine the optimal management of a predator-prey system where the only values are non-market values associated with the species abundances. We find that adverse predation spillovers may alone create social incentives for harvests or other interventions. Moreover, optimally reducing adverse predation spillovers may increase both species' abundances an ecological win-win outcome that increases economic surplus, although the result depends on the controls used. We examine predator removal and predator exclosures that shelter prey from predation. Using a numerical example of the Great Lakes Piping Plover, an endangered prey bird, and Merlins, a falcon predator, we find predator exclosures can reduce inefficiencies and produce a win-win outcome.

A new index of immigration policy is presented, showing how immigration restrictions increased over time but, in contrast with the US, Argentina remained open to mass migration until the 1930s. The quantitative evidence presented here suggests that there were economic reasons to restrict immigration prior to the 1930s, namely rising inequality, the closing of the frontier, and the declining relative quality of immigrants. A political economy interpretation helps to understand the long-run evolution of immigration policy. Labour interests could not be translated into Parliament in a direct way. A large share of workers did not have the right to vote simply because they were foreigners. Inequality influenced immigration policy through social unrest since those negatively affected by massive immigration developed alternative actions: general strikes, labour unrest, and violence. Contrary to what economic theory would have predicted, anti-immigration legislation came from Argentinian capital and landowners who feared political and social unrest.","[Sanchez-Alonso, Blanca] Univ CEU San Pablo, Madrid, Spain",San Pablo CEU University,"Sánchez-Alonso, B (通讯作者)，Univ CEU San Pablo, Madrid, Spain.",,"Sanchez-Alonso, Blanca/N-6581-2013","Sanchez-Alonso, Blanca/0000-0002-1967-7455",,,,,81,13,15,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Although governments and scholars agree that the system needs improvement, no such substantial reform has yet been undertaken. Based on the literature study and more than twenty interviews, this article explains the absence of an international environment organisation, using three theories of new institutionalism: historical, rational choice and discursive institutionalism. Through the notion of path dependency, historical institutionalism explains how the self-reinforcing cycle of a rather diffused development of the IEG system, characterised by incremental changes, has made the system more complicated and prevented substantial institutional change. Historical institutionalism also highlights power inequalities and lack of trust between nation-states, as well as turf wars between international organisations, as key explanatory factors hampering IEG reform. Rational choice institutionalism complements such explanations by showing how incremental institutional changes that do not add up to substantial reform are the result of the fact that neither nation-states nor international organisations are interested in establishing a powerful environment organisation that might encroach upon their sovereignty. Finally, discursive institutionalism suggests that the norm to do at least something to improve the IEG system has prompted nation-states to create symbolic institutions. The concept of socialisation helps to explain why incremental institutional developments within the UN system are more likely than substantial reform. The article shows that new institutionalism theories complement rather than contradict one another, resulting in a more holistic explanation of lack of IEG reform.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Environm Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Vijge, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",marjanneke.vijge@wur.nl,,"Vijge, Marjanneke/0000-0002-3024-8838",,,,,61,17,19,1,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Most previous studies however, do not differentiate different input structures in manufacturing processing exports and normal exports. Using China as an example, this paper exemplifies how implications of results obtained using different export assumptions differ. The study posits that the utilization of traditional I-O model results in an overestimation of emissions embodied in processing exports and an underestimation in normal exports. The estimate of CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports drops by 32% when the extended I-O model is used. The choice of export assumption has more impact on the decomposition results for processing exports. The study further highlights that for a country with an export structure similar to China, it is meaningful to look into the impact of export assumption in embodied emission studies.

This paper discusses lessons for food security from historic and prehistoric cities. The Chicago school of urban sociology established a modernist understanding of urbanism as an essentialist reality separate from its larger life-support system. However, different urban histories have given rise to a remarkable spatial diversity and temporal variation viewed at the global and long-term scales that are often overlooked in urban scholarship. Drawing on two case studies from widely different historical and cultural contexts - the Classic Maya civilization of the late first millennium AD and Byzantine Constantinople - this paper demonstrates urban farming as a pertinent feature of urban support systems over the long-term and global scales. We show how urban gardens, agriculture, and water management as well as the linked social-ecological memories of how to uphold such practices over time have contributed to long-term food security during eras of energy scarcity. We exemplify with the function of such local blue-green infrastructures during chocks to urban supply lines. We conclude that agricultural production is not the antithesis of the city, but often an integrated urban activity that contribute to the resilience of cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a method for evaluating how water is reallocated within the economy in response to changes in final demand and changes in the technical water needs of activities and consumers. The empirical application, which is for the Catalan economy, shows important asymmetries in the effects that exogenous inflows and changes in water technical requirements have on water reallocation. In the process of water distribution, exogenous inflows mostly benefit agriculture and damage private consumers. On the other hand, increases in technical water requirements have negative effects on agriculture and positive effects on the other production activities and consumers. The results of the study suggest that agriculture is an important activity not only in terms of water distribution but also in terms of water reallocation due to changes in final demand and technical water needs.

Such studies have shown that restoring peatlands may be successfully achieved and will bring back habitats and biodiversity in areas previously submitted to peat extraction and plant communities. Meanwhile, the unique long term C sequestration function of peatland ecosystems can be re-established. However, the C footprint of peat extraction is still real, as long-term locked up carbon is released through exposition with oxygen; but the fate of C after peat usage and its interaction with the atmosphere is still a largely unknown field of peatland C cycle. Preliminary results indicate that raw Sphagnum fibers could be successfully used in growing media, diminishing largely the C footprint. Switching from peat to other components using compost and other industrial byproducts appears a valuable alternative towards sustainability and allows the use of suppressive microorganisms in these medium. However, peat alternatives may be limited because of overall availability and because of a growing demand for artificial media with the coming expansion of urban farming and superfruit (raspberry, strawberry, blueberry) production.","[Caron, J.] Univ Laval, Soil Sci & Agrifood Engn Dept, Envirotron, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Caron, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Soil Sci & Agrifood Engn Dept, Envirotron, 2480 Hochelaga, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",,,,,,,,47,23,24,1,38,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66052-57-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2013,982.0,,,,,,15.0,22,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2013.982.1,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture; Soil Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGP15,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323698200001,0

These countries show the highest growing rates in wine consumption and are forecasted to become increasingly more strategic for Italian wine producers. Design/methodology/approach - A SWOT analysis is applied to the most recent set of secondary data available from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), the Italian National Institute for Foreign Trade (ICE), the International Organisation of Wine and Vine (OIV) and Euromonitor International reports. Findings - The study reveals that the most interesting markets for Italian wines are China and South Korea. The key strengths are mainly related to high quality products, evoking classic values and being perceived as a status symbol, while the main concerns for Italian wines are mainly related to promotion and distribution issues. Research limitations/implications - The SWOT analysis can be used to develop a strategy that takes into consideration the potential strengths and opportunities and the impact of weaknesses and threats, but it cannot cover all the possible aspects Italian wineries must know about Asian markets. It offers a base for further and deeper thoughts about the how to succeed in the most dynamic and challenging markets of the next 20 years.

Design/methodology/approach - The study has a 3 x 2 (stimulus x location) between-subjects design. One pictorial and two textual package elements, located on the top right- or top left-hand side of a package, were used as stimuli. Visual attention was measured by eye-tracking. A total of 199 university students participated. The data were analysed using a two-way ANOVA and a Pearson's chi-square analysis with standardised residuals. Findings - The results show that in order to receive the most direct attention, textual elements should be on the left-hand side of a package, whereas pictorial elements should be on the right-hand side. This is inconsistent with previous design directions (based on recall), suggesting the opposite element organisation. Originality/value - Previous research has focused on recall (whether respondents remember having seen package elements) or preference (whether respondents prefer a package based on element positioning). The focus of the present study determined whether respondents actually saw the different elements on a package, and how long it took them to detect such elements. Detection time for certain element types can be viewed as a new and complementary way of evaluating the position of package elements. The paper also addresses whether preference is a result of easy information acquisition.","[Otterbring, Tobias; Shams, Poja; Wastlund, Erik; Gustafsson, Anders] Karlstad Univ, Serv Res Ctr, Karlstad, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Anders] BI Norwegian Sch Management, Oslo, Norway",Karlstad University; BI Norwegian Business School,"Otterbring, T (通讯作者)，Karlstad Univ, Serv Res Ctr, Karlstad, Sweden.",tobias.otterbring@kau.se,"Wästlund, Erik/E-6249-2015; Gustafsson, Anders/M-9919-2019; Otterbring, Tobias/GVS-3728-2022; Shams, Poja/D-4398-2018","Gustafsson, Anders/0000-0001-8278-1442; Otterbring, Tobias/0000-0002-0283-8777; Shams, Poja/0000-0001-9751-6000; Wastlund, Erik/0000-0001-8102-8168",,,,,58,26,29,3,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We first present a number of perspectives on this topic from disciplines such as economic geography, management science, sociology and environmental sciences. Each of these approaches brings in a specific focus: the consequences of geographical dispersion of economic activities, measurement of ecological and social impact, managing sustainability in supply chains, and power asymmetry among economic actors. Until now, these disciplinary research lines have remained unconnected. We argue that ecological economics provides a promising background for a more holistic conceptualization. To this end, we formulate five basic questions that serve to advance the study of sustainability throughout the product chain by connecting the foci of the identified scientific disciplines. The aim of advancing a holistic perspective has guided the selection of papers for this special subsection, which are introduced throughout the text. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A case study of changing calculative frames in local energy policy in Finland,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Science and technology studies; Calculative practices; Energy production; Forestry accounting; Policy analysis,POLITICS; SUSTAINABILITY; SPACE,"The paper explores the role of natural resource accounting and calculations as tools for inducing movement towards ecologically sound policy making. We draw from the theoretical debates in social studies of science and technology (STS) to understand how calculations gain their power in real-world decision-making. Through in-depth case analysis of a local energy production decision in Finland, we study how and under what conditions calculative methods related to environmental valuation affect the rationalities applied in policy decisions. On the basis of our analysis, we claim that new calculative rationalities do not become significant through changing ways of thinking alone. There is a need for shift of calculative framing. This shift requires active promotion by powerful actors and furthermore, new framings need to become embedded in the rules of the game of decision making. Our analysis suggests that the methods of STS can provide a valuable tool for economists' creation of richer understanding of the dynamics between calculative rationalities and the institutions of decision-making. In-depth case analysis of decision making involving the use of natural resources brings out the multitude of ways in which calculations can take part in or be excluded from the making of natural resource policy.

However, we do not know much about how economic actors created new social ties deliberately in order to pursue their objectives. This article analyses the way in which merchants and entrepreneurs used specific rituals to establish formal social ties, with the intent of protecting their business relationships. It focuses on relational instruments that until now had been neglected, particularly godparenthood and marriage witnessing. It shows that formalization, ritualization, and publicity of ties were used by entrepreneurs to establish trust with their business associates, for example when information was asymmetric or when institutions were perceived as inefficient in guaranteeing mutual good behaviour. The analysis covers a long period, from the late middle ages to today. It pays particular attention to the consequences of the Reformation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and of the industrial revolution in the nineteenth. Contrary to the received wisdom, it suggests that formal social ties such as godparenthood continued to play an important role in economic activity during and after the industrial revolution. New databases on early modern Italy and nineteenth-century France are used.",,,,,"Alfani, Guido/AAF-6090-2020","ALFANI, GUIDO/0000-0001-5534-8694",,,,,76,18,20,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Mean undergraduate grade point averages (GPAs) increased from 2.6 in 1985-1986 to 3.1 in 2004-2005. Although higher student GPAs might be evidence of grade inflation, university departments might have experienced productivity improvements that enhanced student learning, given inputs. We represent the technology by the directional distance function. Departments produce two outputs-grade points earned by students and the information content of those grades-using faculty and student inputs. The entropy index is used to proxy the information content of grade distributions. The estimates indicate; no systematic changes in inefficiency over time; a movement along the production frontier toward a mix of outputs with relative more grade points and less entropy; a shift toward non-tenure track faculty that increases the shadow price of entropy relative to grade points.","[Summary, Rebecca; Weber, William L.] SE MO State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA",,"Weber, WL (通讯作者)，SE MO State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 1 Univ Plaza, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA.",rsummary@semo.edu; wlweber@semo.edu,,,,,,,40,10,17,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Using individual-level clickstream data from a third-party automotive website, we tracked the web pages selected by users as they browsed the site and their exposures to premium placement display ads for different vehicle makes (e.g., Ford, Toyota). Pages on the site were classified into those that displayed information about a specific vehicle make (a make page) versus those that did not (a non-make page). For each make-page viewed, the specific automotive make selected (e.g., Ford, Toyota) was also recorded. We use these data to develop a model of users' make-specific page choices as a function of prior banner ad exposure on the site. Consumer heterogeneity is captured using a Bayesian Mixture approach. We find that banner ads influence subsequent choices of which make-specific pages to view for ads, served during the current browsing session but not for ads served in previous sessions. The effect of banner ads is also segmented: users in one segment (54%) reacted positively, users in a second segment (46%) were not influenced. Using a standard continuous approach to heterogeneity, we would have concluded-incorrectly-that banner advertising has no effect on the subsequent selection of make-specific pages. For the positively reacting segment, we estimate that the elasticity of make-page choice with respect to banner ad exposure is just under 0.2. Users in this segment appear less focused in their site browsing behavior and tend to stay longer than users in the non-reacting segment.","[Rutz, Oliver J.] Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bucklin, Randolph E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Rutz, OJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Paccar Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",orutz@uw.edu; rbucklin@anderson.ucla.edu,,,,,,,43,22,30,1,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Second, we test a conditional logit model using French firm-level data in an international comparative study. We confirm evidence of a strong pollution haven effect for our pooled sample of countries receiving French direct investments. However, through a sensitivity analysis, we validate this finding for developed countries and most of emerging economies and Central and Eastern European countries, but not for most countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and developing countries, where a more stringent environmental regulation seems to attract investments.

J,"Greif, A",,,,"Greif, Avner",,,The Maghribi traders: a reappraisal?,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INSTITUTIONS; ENFORCEMENT; EXCHANGE; MEDIEVAL,"Previous studies concluded that a private-order institution based on a multilateral reputation mechanism was particularly important in governing agency relations among the Maghribi traders who operated in the Muslim Mediterranean. The legal system and a bilateral reputation mechanism were particularly important among the Genoese traders. Initial cultural, social, and political factors led to this institutional distinction, while the incorporation of culture in the resulting institutions influenced subsequent institutional developments. In particular, the particularities of the late medieval European institutions contributed to the rise of the modern-impersonal-markets in Europe. The analysis also substantiates the contention that private-order institutions can support sophisticated exchange and market-promoting policies should take this into account, particularly in countries lacking an effective court system. An article by Edwards and Ogilvie challenges this analysis. It alleges that the Maghribis, like European traders, relied on court enforcement and a bilateral reputation mechanism in which a narrow social circle responded to opportunism. This article shows that Edwards and Ogilvie's analysis and conclusions are wrong. It refutes each of their empirical claims and presents additional pieces of evidence supporting the institutional distinction conjecture. The discussion is structured around the methodological challenge associated with comparative and historical institutional analysis.","[Greif, Avner] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Greif, A (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Greif, Avner/D-6973-2011",,,,,,54,55,65,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Apprenticeship appears much more fluid than is traditionally understood. Many apprentices did not complete their terms of indenture; late arrival and early departure from the master's household were widespread. Other apprentices appear to have been absent temporarily, returning to the master shortly before the end of their indenture. Regression analysis indicates that the patterns of presence and absence broadly reflect the resources and external opportunities available to apprentices.","[Minns, Chris; Wallis, Patrick] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Minns, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, London, England.",,"Wallis, Patrick/AAF-6435-2019","Minns, Chris/0000-0003-1685-7757",,,,,76,50,54,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

(Eur J Oper Res 2:429-444, 1978), Banker et al. (Manag Sci 30:1078-1092, 1984) were both radial models. These models and their varied extensions have remained the most popular DEA models in terms of utilization. The benchmark targets they determined for inefficient units are primarily based on the notion of maintaining the same input and output mixes originally employed by the evaluated unit (i.e. disregarding allocative considerations). This paper presents a methodology to investigate allocative and overall efficiency in the absence of defined input and output prices. The benchmarks determined from models based on this methodology will consider all possible input and/or output mixes. Application of this methodology is illustrated on a model of the financial intermediary function of a bank branch network.","[Paradi, Joseph C.; Tam, Fai Keung] Univ Toronto, Ctr Management Technol & Entrepreneurship, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada",University of Toronto,"Paradi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Management Technol & Entrepreneurship, 200 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada.",paradi@mie.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,10,4,5,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Insurance amenities and restrictions against pre-existing conditions among private insurers introduce asymmetry to the model. We confirm that the public system services a less healthy and wealthy population (adverse selection for public insurance). Simulation of choices over time predicts a slight crowding out of private insurance only for the most pessimistic scenario in terms of population aging and the evolution of education. Eliminating the restrictions on pre-existing conditions would slightly ameliorate the level (but not the trend) of the disproportionate accumulation of less healthy individuals in the public insurance program over time.","[Pardo, Cristian] St Josephs Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; [Schott, Whitney] Univ Penn, Ctr Populat Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Saint Joseph's University; University of Pennsylvania,"Pardo, C (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Dept Econ, 5600 City Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",cpardo@sju.edu; wschott@pop.upenn.edu,,"Pardo, Cristian/0000-0002-9862-0202; Schott, Whitney/0000-0001-9303-8718","NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD047879, T32 HD007242] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,32,7,10,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

These use systems are a) traditional conversion to crop land, b) sustainable management of the forest (e.g. by growing high-quality, semi-forest coffee), and c) strict conservation. We find that under business as usual conversion to cropland yields the highest net present income value for the local population. Taking into account watershed services, sustainable forest use is in the best interests of the country for discount rates of 10% or lower. Taking into account the global benefits of biodiversity conservation and carbon storage, sustainable forest management also yields the highest total economic value while strict conservation does not pass a cost-benefit test even at a discount rate of 3%.

I exploit the circumstances surrounding industrialization in South Carolina between 1881 and 1900 to show that the establishment of textile mills coincided with a 6-10 percent fertility reduction. Migrating households are responsible for most of the observed decline. Higher rates of textile employment and child mortality for migrants can explain part of the result, and I conjecture that an increase in child-raising costs induced by the separation of migrant households from their extended families may explain the remaining gap in migrant-native fertility.","Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Wanamaker, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, 524 Stokely Management Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",wanamaker@utk.edu,,"Wanamaker, Marianne/0000-0003-2611-6979",,,,,47,17,24,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,,,J ECON HIST,J.

Remarkably, structural adjustment models describing the spatio-temporal dynamics of population and employment levels or growth traditionally do not include intersectoral economic dynamics. This paper argues and shows that allowing for economic linkages across sectors in these models adds considerable value, especially in forecasting. An econometric model of populationemployment dynamics, in which sectoral variations in economic development are explicitly taken into account, is applied to a large urban planning policy proposal in the Netherlands. The empirical analyses suggest that population dynamics are largely exogenous, population changes drive employment in particular in the industry and retail sectors, and employment in all sectors depends strongly on intersectoral dynamics. Intersectoral dynamics appear as important drivers of regional sectoral employment changes; they are even more important than population changes, and their effect shows up clearly even within the Dutch institutional context where strict regulatory housing and planning restrictions are enforced.","[de Graaff, Thomas; Florax, Raymond J.

Existing studies have revealed much about the mechanisms underlying the development of agrarian capitalism. However, we currently lack any consensus as to when the critical developments occurred. This is largely due to the absence of sufficiently large and geographically wide-ranging datasets but is also attributable to conceptual weaknesses in much of the literature. This article develops a new approach to the problem and argues that agrarian capitalism was dominant in southern and eastern England by 1700 but that in northern England the critical developments came later.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Shaw-Taylor, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-1579, RES-000-23-0131] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,65,50,50,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The adjustment is motivated by environmental concern, but hindered by skepticism about announced changes in the state of the environment. Changes in the quality of the environment affect Earth's carrying capacity. By expanding the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model to include these features we show that, despite skepticism, the environment does not deteriorate to a state in which humans cannot exist. We also show that in the ideal case of no skepticism, the interplay between the non-optimally changing environmental concerns and carrying capacity leads the world's environment and human population to a unique interior steady state along an oscillating course.

The results show that CFUG income distribution is highly skewed; the high- and low-income one-third of CFUGs in the sample account for 74.3 and 4.1% of the total income, respectively. CFUG income depends on age of the CFUG institution, CFUG membership size, and, in particular, on whether the community forest features the valuable timber species Sal (Shorea robusta, C. F. Gaertn.) and/or Chir Pine (Pinus roxburghii Sarg.). CFUG expenditure pattern is also highly skewed, with 85.2% of all public services and infrastructure financed by the one-third high-income CFUGs. CFUG financing of public services and infrastructure is shaped by income, management costs, and socio-political and contextual factors, such as whether the CFUG jurisdiction covers several wards and the presence of existing public infrastructure in the community. Finally, results show that the amounts of revenue generated through community forestry are negligible when compared to households' private gains from extraction of products from community forests, indicating a limited potential for redistribution of benefits under the current taxation system.

In order to face these new challenges, companies seek for new approaches to their innovation strategies and processes in more open modes of innovation such as Open Innovation. To achieve the potential benefits of opening up innovation processes, managers have to take into account the need to develop organizational capabilities to successfully manage open innovation. Thus, managers need to address several determinants at different levels to facilitate the development of organizational capabilities. While most open innovation literature neglects the human side of open innovation teams, this survey article, based firstly on a literature review and then in a near future on exploratory interviews, will try to determine the capabilities and skills that open innovation managers need in order to lead open innovation teams.","[Beatrix, Christine] ESC Rennes Sch Business, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business,,christine.beatrix@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,22,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,81.0,92,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500009,0

To improve the nutrition of chapattis, normally legume flour is used in the region. The purpose of the current study is to assess the nutritional quality and safety of chapattis supplemented with soy flour. Design/methodology/approach - Wheat and soybean were procured and soy flour was prepared. Trypsin inhibitor contents and mineral contents of different flour and chapattis prepared were determined. Chapattis were prepared from different flour blends and whole wheat flour. To assess the quality and acceptability, the chapattis were presented to a panel of judges and the sensory evaluation was carried out for color, taste, aroma, chew ability, folding ability and overall acceptability characteristics. The data obtained for each parameter were subjected to statistical analysis to determine the level of significance. Findings - The phytic acid and trypsin content were higher in un-autoclaved soy flour supplement composite flour. The defattening of soy flour also increases the level of these anti-nutrients in chapattis. The phytate and trypsin content of composite flour decreased as a result of baking. The protein, fiber and ash contents of composite flour increased while moisture content and nitrogen free extracts (NFE) decreased by the addition of soy flour. Mineral contents of chapattis except Mn increased by the incorporation of soy flour. The chapattis were found acceptable by the panel of judges at 10 percent replacement level of whole wheat flour by soy flour. Practical implications - The results of the study indicate that 10 percent supplementation of soy flour in wheat flour was found acceptable by consumers as it did not affect the sensory attribute. For improved nutrition and to combat protein energy malnutrition, chapattis flour can be supplemented with soy flour. Originality/value - The soy supplementation of wheat flour will improve the nutritional quality of the chapatti flour as soy flour is rich in high-quality protein and mineral. The anti-nutritional can be minimized or inactivated by autoclaving the soybean.","[Khan, Muhammad Issa; Anjum, Faqir Muhammad; Pasha, Imran; Sameen, Ayesha; Nadeem, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Natl Inst Food Sci & Technol, Faisalabad, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Khan, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Natl Inst Food Sci & Technol, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",drkhan@uaf.edu.pk,"ANJUM, FAQIR/AAW-9311-2020; Pasha, Imran/AAA-5186-2019; SAMEEN, AYSHA/AAG-8064-2019; Nadeem, Muhammad/AAZ-2541-2021; Pasha, Imran/I-7234-2015; anjum, Faqir/F-5883-2015; Khan, Muhammad Issa/J-3747-2015","Pasha, Imran/0000-0001-7106-8860; SAMEEN, AYSHA/0000-0002-3125-675X; Khan, Muhammad Issa/0000-0002-3241-1248",,,,,33,6,6,0,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper aims to analyse the kind of tourist whose reason for travelling to a certain destination is to enjoy the local cuisine. In this case, the destination is Cordoba (Spain). Design/methodology/approach - A list of restaurants and eating establishments offering dishes typical of Cordoba was compiled. A questionnaire was designed with the aim of analysing and defining tourists' opinions of Cordoba's cuisine. This questionnaire was filled out by a random sample of tourists in one of ten different restaurants. Of these ten establishments, four were classified as restaurants, three as tabernas, and three as a mixture of both restaurant and taberna. In each restaurant, the questionnaire was distributed randomly among Spanish and foreign tourists in the city on a daily basis. A total of 213 questionnaires was obtained. The fieldwork was carried out in October and November 2009. The tabling and analysis of the data obtained was carried out through the development of an appropriate database. The results were obtained using uni-variant and bi-variant analysis techniques (contingency tables, chi-square contrasts and correlations). Findings - The results of the study reflect the high level of education of the tourists surveyed, the length of their stay, the high percentage of foreign tourists, and the high level of satisfaction with both the local cuisine and with other tourist attractions Cordoba has to offer. Practical implications - The results imply that there is scope for developing food tourism products which would attract such tourists and could be used to promote Cordoba as a centre for culinary tourism. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first studies on culinary tourism to be carried out in an important destination for cultural tourism in Europe, namely the city of Cordoba. This paper also tries to create a profile of the food tourist, a tourist whose primary motivation for visiting a given location is to explore the local cuisine.","[Lopez-Guzman, Tomas] Univ Cordoba, Fac Labour Sci, Cordoba, Spain; [Sanchez-Canizares, Sandra] Univ Cordoba, Fac Law, Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba,"López-Guzmán, T (通讯作者)，Univ Cordoba, Fac Labour Sci, Cordoba, Spain.",tomas.lopez@uco.es,"Lopez-Guzman, Tomas/Y-8133-2019; Sanchez Canizares, Sandra M/H-4884-2019","Lopez-Guzman, Tomas/0000-0001-8800-8223; Sanchez Canizares, Sandra M/0000-0003-0705-3327",,,,,26,73,80,2,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The intervention in this study encompasses information meetings where two educational computer programs highlighting the five a day concept, and food hygiene were showcased in conjunction with a group discussion. In total, 92 people living or working in a selected city district participated. The effect of the intervention was determined by means of inquiries (multiple-choice) that were carried out prior to, immediately following, and three weeks after the intervention. Findings - A statistically significant improvement in knowledge of the concepts five a day, cross-contamination, and recommended storage temperature (for smoked salmon and raw mince meat) was observed, however, no major change in behavior was reported. Practical implications - The knowledge improvement suggests that the education programs, in conjunction with discussions, are a useful information model for raising awareness about the notion of five a day and food safety. The results of the study make it clear that there are difficulties in getting people to change their behavior, let alone getting them to participate in health education offered locally.

Design/methodology/approach - A desktop study of recent outbreaks and recalls that have occurred in the USA and EU was undertaken with a view to determining the produce items implicated and factors causing the emergence of outbreaks. The question A call for HACCP on farms? is explored. Findings - Minimally processed fresh-cut produce represents a particular challenge to food safety. The research has highlighted the need to mitigate risk at all stages but with specific emphasis at the pre-farm gate stage. A more comprehensive and integrated approach to risk management is arguably needed. A call for HACCP on the farm or farm food safety management system may be warranted in future if fresh produce outbreaks continue to rise. However, further research is needed to establish the guidelines of HACCP adoption at the farm level.

Even though the availability of vast natural capital reserves has commonly been linked to the neglect of human development, most of the literature has continued to focus on economic performance. This paper is the first to empirically investigate the link between natural resource wealth and public health expenditures in light of the hypothesis that resource wealth as a source of unearned state income enhances state autonomy and increases volatility, which leads to policies that fail to prioritize human development. Using a large panel dataset of world countries covering the period from 1995 to 2009, we find a robust, significant inverse relationship between natural resource dependence, and even abundance, and public health spending over time. The effect remains significant after controlling for state autonomy, volatility, and other factors. These findings have implications for national authorities as well as the extractive industry. Governments should be made accountable for natural resource wealth and correct taxation could provide additional resources, earmarked for health. The extractive industry could increase their investments in sustainable Corporate Social Responsibility operations, specifically in the health sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We do this by linking their investment behavior on the Berlin Stock Exchange to political events in Saxony. Here the electoral law was changed twice: In 1896 a very restrictive franchise was introduced, which was abolished in 1909 and replaced by a more democratic electoral law. Our study reveals that the Berlin Stock Exchange reacted to political changes and elections in Saxony. This is an important finding since historical research has claimed that the increased democratization in the German Kaiserreich measured in a larger participation of the population was not accompanied by a larger political influence of the parliaments. Furthermore we can show that for capital owners the possible negative effects seemed to outweigh possible positive effects of democratization.

It is demonstrated that, at a global level, economic growth is strongly correlated with environmental impacts, and barriers to fast decoupling are large and numerous. On the other hand, low or negative growth is highly correlated with increasing unemployment in most market economies, and strategies to change this lead to difficult questions and tradeoffs. The coexistence of these two correlations - which have rarely been studied together in the literature on green growth, degrowth and a-growth - justifies ambivalence about growth. To make key environmental goals compatible with full employment, the decoupling of environmental impacts from economic output has to be accompanied by a reduction of dependence on growth. In particular, strategies to tackle unemployment without the need for growth, several of which are studied in this article, need much more attention in research and policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A fixed-effects panel-data regression model was employed to identify possible causes of this upsurge. Ivory seizures were categorised as worked or raw. These categories were also divided into four weight classes ranging from under 10 kg to over 1000 kg. With Africa being the source of ivory and much of the poached ivory destined for Asia it was hypothesised that smugglers would respond to shipping costs. The results showed that shipping costs, especially for large shipments, were correlated to smuggling levels. Other factors include global interest rates, which motivate stockpiling by criminal organisations. Stability in Africa as measured by refugee numbers correlates to raw ivory seizures. The data describes a scenario where three forces converged to escalate poaching in the late 2000s. Raw ivory was being made increasingly available at a time from Central African range states, when criminal organisations desired larger stockpiles of tusks. The sharp decline in shopping costs gave them the means to take advantage of this. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using the standard datasets in existing empirical applications, three components of a firm's profit function are not separately identified: the fixed cost of an incumbent firm, the entry cost of a new entrant, and the scrap value of an exiting firm. We study the implications of this result on the power of this class of models to identify the effects of different comparative static exercises and counterfactual public policies. First, we derive a closed-form relationship between the three unknown structural functions and the two functions that are identified from the data. We use this relationship to provide the correct interpretation of the estimated objects that are obtained under the 'normalization assumptions' considered in most applications. Second, we characterize a class of counterfactual experiments that are identified using the estimated model, despite the non-separate identification of the three primitives. Third, we show that there is a general class of counterfactual experiments of economic relevance that are not identified. We present a numerical example that illustrates how ignoring the non-identification of these counterfactuals (i.e., making a 'normalization assumption' on some of the three primitives) generates sizable biases that can modify even the sign of the estimated effects. Finally, we discuss possible solutions to address these identification problems.","[Aguirregabiria, Victor; Suzuki, Junichi] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Aguirregabiria, Victor] CEPR, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada",University of Toronto,"Aguirregabiria, V (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",victor.aguirregabiria@utoronto.ca; j.suzuki@utoronto.ca,"AGUIRREGABIRIA, VICTOR/A-1349-2008","AGUIRREGABIRIA, VICTOR/0000-0002-3305-8159",,,,,36,21,28,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The neoclassical tradition is often seen as reliant for its authenticity on a presumption of human avarice - both unbridled consumerism and corporate cupidity - and demanding for its real-world applicability an assumption of continuous economic growth in a world of hard limits. This article examines the question of whether neoclassical theory could instead provide keys to deeper understanding of sustainable consumption. By combining in a single framework neoclassical growth theory, general equilibrium theory and duality theory-and by explicitly considering leisure time - the analysis demonstrates that neoclassical economics yields several useful insights bearing on long-term sustainability. The analysis confirms several tenets of ecological economics and challenges others. Eight propositions emerge from this analysis that could help speed the development of a robust neoclassical theory of sustainable consumption, here branded golden age propositions as they strongly echo the Golden Rule discoveries of Edmund Phelps.

However, few studies have attempted to quantify the potential of agriculture to produce multiple ESS, and to estimate the possibilities for joint production of marketed and non-marketed ESS. A quantification of the trade-offs between non-marketed ESS and production of farm commodities (marketed ESS) may help to better target agricultural policies. We use a well-established biophysical farm-systems model (APSIM) to estimate how alternative farm management practices affect the joint production of ESS on mixed crop-livestock farms in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between the supply of agricultural commodities (crop yields and livestock weight gain) and non-marketed ESS (groundcover, soil carbon, nitrogen supply, and water regulation). Win-win trade-offs between marketed and non-marketed ESS become apparent when the value of agricultural commodity production is monetised. This study shows that, in our study regions, increasing crop residue retention can jointly increase production value and improve ESS provision of groundcover, soil carbon and nitrogen supply.

Interactions with mobile organisms are particularly complex because they depend on the spatial configuration of habitat at large scales. As such conserving habitat is likely to benefit multiple farmers whereas conservation costs are born individually, creating potential interdependencies among farmers. We explore under what conditions landscape-scale management of ecosystem services is likely to benefit farmers compared to managing them at the farm-scale. To do this we develop an agent-based model (ABM) to predict the landscape configuration emerging from farm-scale management under different conditions: initial landscape, crop and pollinator characteristics. As a benchmark, the landscape configuration from landscape-scale management is derived through a global optimization procedure. Not only do we find that efficiency improves with landscape-scale management, but also that all farmers would benefit from it (given dependence of crop yields on ecosystem services). However, we also find that the individual incentives to avoid maintaining habitat on one's own land are relatively high; therefore creating conditions for a Prisoner's Dilemma-type problem. On the other hand we also demonstrate that an incentive-compatible contract exists that can promote efficient landscape management (by combining side-payments with fines for defection).

Previous studies modeled such expectations using a first-order Markov (FOM) process. However, empirical evidence from several categories suggest that inter-promotion intervals can last several weeks implying that a FOM process that conditions future expectations of prices only on current-period prices can be limiting. We utilize a Proportional Hazard model (PHM) to characterize consumers' rational expectation of future price promotion. We first show that estimating a dynamic structural model that uses a FOM specification for rational expectations can bias estimates of promotion effects with both simulation analysis and scanner panel data from four consumer packaged goods product categories. Secondly, we empirically show that a structural model employing a PHM specification for promotion expectations fits the data better than ones that assume only a FOM price or promotion expectation. Lastly, we show using an analysis of promotion policy changes that a structural model with a FOM expectation can lead to suboptimal managerial decisions.","[Liu, Yan] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Balachander, Subramanian] Purdue Univ, Krannert Grad Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, 4112 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",yliu@mays.tamu.edu; sbalacha@purdue.edu,"Chen, Yu/JLL-0171-2023",,,,,,38,12,14,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The purpose of this paper is to describe Foodbank WA's innovative food bank plus approach of incorporating healthy lifestyle initiatives (i.e. nutrition and physical activity education) into its core food bank business, so as to target priority issues such as food insecurity, poor food literacy, overweight, obesity, poor nutrition and physical inactivity. Design/methodology/approach - A case study approach was utilised to explore Foodbank WA's Healthy Food for All (R) (HFFA) strategy. HFFA is a comprehensive state wide, school and community based strategy, including the School Breakfast Programme, Food Sensations (R) and Choose to Move initiatives, designed to promote healthy lifestyles to low socioeconomic and vulnerable groups - a major target group of food banks. Findings - Since its inception in 2007, the delivery of food, education and resources has increased across all of Foodbank WA's HFFA initiatives. Evaluation results from feedback surveys demonstrate the success of these interventions to positively impact upon food security, health and wellbeing of participants. Originality/value - HFFA is a unique, effective and novel strategy that addresses a number of health and nutrition issues. Food banks are well placed to deliver food literacy and healthy lifestyle initiatives. Foodbank WA's holistic approach and demonstrated success provides other food banks with a best practice model and knowledge base for the development of similar health promotion strategies and interventions.","[Butcher, Lucy Meredith; Chester, Miranda Rose; Aberle, Leisha Michelle; Bobongie, Vanessa Jo-Ann; Godrich, Stephanie Louise; Milligan, Rex Alan Keith; Tartaglia, Jennifer; Thorne, Louise Maree] Foodbank WA, Hlth Food All, Perth, WA, Australia; [Davies, Christina] Univ Western Australia, Sch Populat Hlth M431, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Begley, Andrea] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",University of Western Australia; Curtin University,"Butcher, LM (通讯作者)，Foodbank WA, Hlth Food All, Perth, WA, Australia.",lucy.butcher@foodbankwa.org.au,"Davies, Christina R/J-5508-2013","Davies, Christina R/0000-0001-9216-1108; Butcher, Lucy/0000-0002-2960-3281; Begley, Andrea/0000-0002-5448-8932; Godrich, Stephanie/0000-0003-3067-8253; Chester, Miranda/0000-0003-3598-9755",State Government of Western Australia (Department of Education); State Government of Western Australia (Department of Health); State Government of Western Australia (Department of Regional Development); Channel 7 Telethon Trust; BHP Billiton Iron Ore; Australian Red Cross; Cancer Council of Western Australia,State Government of Western Australia (Department of Education); State Government of Western Australia (Department of Health); State Government of Western Australia (Department of Regional Development); Channel 7 Telethon Trust; BHP Billiton Iron Ore; Australian Red Cross; Cancer Council of Western Australia(Cancer Council Western Australia),"This work was supported by the State Government of Western Australia (Departments of Education, Health and Regional Development), Channel 7 Telethon Trust, BHP Billiton Iron Ore, the Australian Red Cross and Cancer Council of Western Australia.",,56,27,28,1,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Considering height in this respect, nineteenth-century France, unlike most Western countries, did not pay an urban penalty. Thanks to a substantial set of individual data (105,324 observations), based on the draft lottery of Frenchmen born in the year 1848, we are able to prove that this French exception did not, in fact, exist.

A sugarcane supply chain was used to evaluate VSM's applicability to the food industry by exploring how VSM can help to understand its complexity. Design/methodology/approach - VSM and qualitative research methods were combined in an interactive manner to produce a VSM diagnosis. Findings - The VSM diagnosis highlighted that while continuity of the system is not at risk, many improvement opportunities exist. For example, the local mill management lacks autonomy, essential operational measurement cannot be realised, coordination is deficient and a vision or identity for the mill area and a joint effort to engage in strategic considerations is missing. Miller-grower fragmentation surfaced as one cause of these shortcomings. Research limitations/implications - Although VSM revealed shortcomings, it was unable to facilitate interventions for improvement. VSM's capacity in dealing with shortcomings should be strengthened and the merit of VSM in other food-related supply systems should be investigated. Practical implications - Millers and growers need to become genuine partners and work jointly on the issues that challenge the system to realise the full potential that is embedded in the system. Originality/value - VSM has not been applied in the sugar industry context and the amount of researches that explore sugarcane supply chains holistically is limited.","[Hildbrand, Sandra; Bodhanya, Shamim] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business & Leadership, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Hildbrand, S (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business & Leadership, Durban, South Africa.",Hildbrands@ukzn.ac.za,,,South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI); National Research Foundation,South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI); National Research Foundation,This research was funded by the South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI) and the National Research Foundation.

This paper proposes several new robust estimators of the autocorrelation coefficient. First, we consider an autoregressive process of the first order AR(1) to be observed. Robust estimators of the autocorrelation coefficient are proposed in a straightforward way based on robust regression. Further, we consider the task of robust estimation of the autocorrelation coefficient of residuals of linear regression. The task is connected to verifying the assumption of independence of residuals and robust estimators of the autocorrelation coefficient are defined based on the Durbin-Watson test statistic for robust regression. The main result is obtained for the implicitly weighted autocorrelation coefficient with small weights assigned to outlying measurements. This estimator is based on the least weighted squares regression and we exploit its asympotic properties to derive an asymptotic test that the autocorrelation coefficient is equal to 0. Finally, we illustrate different estimators on real economic data, which reveal the advantage of the approach based on the least weighted squares regression. The estimator turns out to be resistant against the presence of outlying measurements.","[Kalina, Jan; Vlckova, Katarina] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Comp Sci, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Comp Sci, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic.",kalina@cs.cas.cz; vlckova@cs.cas.cz,"Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364",,,,,15,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,588.0,597,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700058,0

We intend to use a sample of Czech SMEs for the period of five years to verify existing relationship between profitability and components of working capital. The major components of working capital are inventories and receivables on the asset side and payables on the liabilities side. We want to clarify the impact of short term capital management on profitability of the companies. It is well known that the higher the liquidity of the company the lower the profitability, because the capital is invested in less productive assets - e.g. cash. However, there may be some special impact of different features of working capital in the Czech sample. To verify this hypothesis we decided to use a sample of SMEs because SMEs are much less regulated by accounting standards and they are also less subject to performance management procedures than big (or international) companies. Thus we expect that the effect of working capital management will be more visible on this sample.","[Kocmanova, Sarka; Kubickova, Dana] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague 10100, Czech Republic; [Jindrichovska, Irena] Univ Econ & Management, Prague 15800, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Kocmanova, S (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10100, Czech Republic.",sarka.kocmanova@centrum.cz; dana.kubickova@centrum.cz; irena.jindrichovska@seznam.cz,"Kubickova, Dana/F-5098-2013; Jindrichovska, Irena/N-5867-2019; Jindrichovska, Irena/N-7626-2015",,,,,,15,1,1,1,10,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,709.0,717,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700070,0

However, age differences are often neglected in past work, thus limiting the understanding how effectively NFPs communicate quantitative information across adulthood. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Using eye tracking methodology, the present study examined age and preference differences in attention to weights and %DVs on NFPs during two healthfulness judgement tasks. The extent to which attention predicted judgement accuracy was explored and findings were compared to two additional predictors, prior knowledge and NFP numeracy skills. Findings - Although individuals paid attention to both types of quantitative information, attention to %DVs, but not weights, predicted accuracy, on both tasks. For older adults only, preferences for %DVs were related to %DV attention, and this in turn supported accuracy on the single-NFP task.

We analyse processes enhancing the growth described by GDP and GVA variables using canonical analysis. Structural models of the relationships between dependent and independent variables for each group show that every group has different factors affecting growth and only in the most developed KIS regions the factors are coherent and mutually reinforcing. Less developed regions are not so different from KIS regions, because innovative processes are in line with the development, but in this group factors influencing KIS and high-tech industries do not sufficiently reinforce each other and thus the growth could be reduced. This might be attributed to an essential gap between KIS and non updated production practices in certain sectors. Understanding these processes, it will be possible to create constructed advantage assumptions leading not only to growth and development in every group of regions, but overall to path renewal and convergence processes in less developed regions.","[Pylak, Korneliusz; Majerek, Dariusz] Lublin Univ Technol, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland",Lublin University of Technology,"Pylak, K (通讯作者)，Lublin Univ Technol, Nadbystrzycka 38d St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.",korneliusz.pylak@pollub.pl; d.majerek@pollub.pl,"Majerek, Dariusz/D-3457-2017; Pylak, Korneliusz/A-7270-2013","Majerek, Dariusz/0000-0002-0035-7187; Pylak, Korneliusz/0000-0001-7812-1281",,,,,15,4,4,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1254.0,1264,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700122,0

The migration has the obvious positive impact in getting a needed work force, skilled and unskilled. Besides positive influence the migration has a negative impact on several European economies with regard to sent remittances, because one of the reasons of migration is financial security of family in the country of origin. This paper is aimed to determine the impact on migration and remittances in Europe and find out the most threaten economies.","[Simkova, Martina; Langhamrova, Jitka] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Simková, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",martina.simkova@vse.cz; Langhamj@vse.cz,"Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019","Langhamrova, Jitka/0000-0002-8127-6433",,,,,13,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1497.0,1504,,,,,,8,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700146,0

Various inequality dimensions are characterized and geographically compared by relative inequality measures. In order to measure income inequality by specific measures such as the Gini coefficient, DeVergottini rate, Bonferroni and Tarsitano measures of inequality, have been used the parametric approach based on quantile models. The four-parameter Kappa generalized quantile distribution is flexible enough for regional - comparative population modeling, which is functional for inequality measures. Based on quantitative analysis by using the quantile methods the paper concluded that the Gini, DeVergottini, Bonferroni and Tarsitano measures of inequality, which could be defined by one generalized formula proposed by Tarsitano, are analogous in regional studies. To condense information on inequality of wages of employees of the Slovak Republic and its regions, official individual observations were retained in calculations of Tarsitano's generalized inequality measure based on rankits and displayed in Q-Q plots. Paper came to the conclusion that the same order of geographical regions by the level of income inequality could be reached with using the inequality indexes defined by different type of quantile models.","[Sipkova, L'ubica] Univ Econ, Fac Econ Informat, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia; [Sipko, Juraj] Paneuropean Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Pan-European University,"Sipková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ Informat, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",lubica.sipkova@euba.sk; jurajsipko@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1355.0,1365,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700132,0

The role of any business in society and relationships between organization and society can be examined by the corporate social responsibility and stakeholder approach. Successful corporate social responsibility programs reflect stakeholder preferences and expectations regarding the corporate behavior. This article focuses on the connection between stakeholders and corporate social responsibility. Based on the author research the key stakeholder groups for corporate social responsibility for selected organizations and the most frequent dimensions of corporate social responsibility for these groups were identified. The author research conducted on 100 business entities was based on the stakeholder power-interest matrix used for mapping and identification of key stakeholders in corporate social responsibility and stakeholder-responsibility matrix used for identification of dimensions of corporate social responsibility for selected stakeholders groups.

The decline coincides with a period of rapidly increasing global demand for, and price of, coal, which has made it economically feasible to mine coal that was previously uneconomic. This digging deeper hypothesis is plausible, although our initial surprise at the magnitude of the estimated decline has motivated our investigation of productivity in Australian coal mining, its financial implications and its likely causes. We begin by applying the Staff Working Paper methodology to revised data to estimate the magnitude of the decline. This exercise shrinks the estimated magnitude of the decline to 21 %. We continue by applying an alternate methodology to the revised data to re-estimate the magnitude of the decline. This exercise generates no further change to the estimated rate of decline. We then compare estimates of the decline obtained from value added and gross output frameworks, and we find a considerable shrinkage in the estimated productivity decline that highlights the importance of the Domar factor in productivity measurement. We continue by exploring the financial consequences of the productivity decline. We conclude by joining the search for sources of the productivity decline.","[Lovell, C. A. K.; Lovell, J.

It is also possible, but less common, to use estimated distance functions to estimate the normalised support (or efficient) prices of individual inputs and outputs. A problem that arises in the econometric estimation of these functions is that more than one variable in the estimating equation may be endogenous. In such cases, maximum likelihood estimation can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates. To solve the problem, we use linear programming to construct a quantity index. The distance function is then written in the form of a conventional stochastic frontier model where the explanatory variables are unambiguously exogenous. We use this approach to estimate productivity indexes, measures of environmental change, levels of efficiency, and support prices for a sample of Australian public hospitals.","[O'Donnell, C.

Jones (Trade, balance of payment and growth: essays in honor of Charles P. Kindleberger, Amsterdam, pp 3-21, 1971) shows that a rise in the amount of labor in the economy will increase the output in all industries. We empirically show which industry output is predicted to expand more when the size of labor force grows. Unlike the commonly used Rybczynski Theorem (Economica 22:336-341, 1955) of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, the specific factors model shows that a comparison both of labor intensities and labor demand elasticities plays an important role in determining which output expands relatively more when the size of labor force grows. For this purpose, we illustrate the importance of the parameters of the model in determining how changes in the labor supply affect the output change, with special reference to elasticities of substitution in production. We estimate the elasticity of substitution by using CES production function and show how these estimates describe the general equilibrium of production with one mobile factor (labor) and 25 industries of the US economy using data for 1979-2001. We show that the increase in the supply of labor raise output in all industries, but the magnitudes of the increases in some industries are more than others depending on the value of the elasticity of substitution along with factor intensities between industries. The largest output effect occurs for educational, health care and social service, where a 1 % supply of labor increase would raise output 10.5 %. However, the growth in the labor supply has a small impact on output growth in the range of 0.1-0.6 % in agriculture, petroleum, coal product and finance and insurance industries.","[Akay, Gokhan H.] Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Dept Int Trade, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dogan, Can] North Amer Coll, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77038 USA",Altinbas University,"Akay, GH (通讯作者)，Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Dept Int Trade, Istanbul, Turkey.",hgakay@hotmail.com; dogan@northamerican.edu,"Akay, Gokhan/AAI-2289-2019",,,,,,24,3,4,3,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Whereas there are empirical studies that examine this issue with parametric approaches focusing on the mean level of variables, few studies have addressed climatic impacts in general settings. Given this paucity, we characterize the impacts on crop yield distributions with a non-parametric approach. We examine the case of rice yield in Andhra Pradesh, India, an important state producing rice as a main crop but reported to be vulnerable to climate change. Employing 34 years of data, we apply quantile regressions to untangle the climatic impacts across the quantiles of rice yield, finding three main results. First, substantial heterogeneity in the impacts of climatic variables can be found across the yield distribution. Second, the direction of the climatic impacts on rice yield highly depends on agro-climatic zones. Third, seasonal climatic impacts on rice yield are significant. More specifically, a monsoon-dependent crop is more sensitive to temperature and precipitation, whereas a winter crop remains largely resilient to changes in the levels of climate variables. These findings clarify the idiosyncratic climatic impacts on agriculture in India, and call for location- and season-specific adaptation policies. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, total HMO enrollment has declined since 2000. This study addresses whether managed care and hospital competition continued to show positive effects on hospital cost and quality performance in the post-managed care era. Using data for 1,521 urban hospitals drawn from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, we examined hospital cost per stay and mortality rate in relation to HMO penetration and hospital competition between 2001 and 2005, controlling for patient, hospital, and other market characteristics. Regression analyses were employed to examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal variation in hospital performance. We found that in markets with high HMO penetration, increase in hospital competition over time was associated with decrease in mortality but no change in cost. In markets without high HMO penetration, increase in hospital competition was associated with increase in cost but no change in mortality. Overall, hospitals in high HMO penetration markets consistently showed lower average costs, and hospitals in markets with high hospital competition consistently showed lower mortality rates. Hospitals in markets with high HMO penetration also showed lower mortality rates in 2005 with no such difference found in 2001. Our findings suggest that while managed care may have lost its strength in slowing hospital cost growth, differences in average hospital cost associated with different levels of HMO penetration across markets still persist. Furthermore, these health plans appear to put quality of care on a higher priority than before.","[Jiang, H.

This article uses a new series of wage observations from across England, focusing on rural areas. Analysis of the dataset shows that wages paid to servants in rural England slightly increased over the period considered, but at uneven rates dependent on region and precise occupation of servant. The majority of servants, particularly maids, did not experience any significant increase in the wages they were paid. This article also shows a widening wage gap between male and female servants. When differences between regions were analysed, it was shown that the wages paid to servants did not match the model of the north becoming the high wage zone of England by the mid-nineteenth century, although rates of growth there were the highest. For servants the south generally remained an area of higher wages even in the mid-nineteenth century. Geography was probably not the key variable in determining wage levels. The type of household in which a servant was employed was more important than where it was located. The most important variables were the servants' gender, and their occupations in the household.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Grp Hist Populat & Social Struct, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Field, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Grp Hist Populat & Social Struct, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,"Field, Jacob/0000-0003-3187-3050",,,,,43,11,11,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This issue is particularly of interest for developing countries, where natural resources are becoming scarce at an alarming rate. This paper investigates the causal association between water scarcity and groundwater use efficiency in a rice based cropping system in south India, where groundwater is increasingly becoming a scarce resource. Contextualization of the work is done under the premise of reported contradictions concerning the scarcity - efficiency nexus. Using a two stage approach the causality is estimated: first, farm level groundwater use efficiency (GWUE) scores are calculated using non-parametric efficiency analysis, and then these inefficiencies are linked to farm level scarcity indicators using the Inverse Probability Weighting method. Our results showed a negative causal association between farm level water scarcity and GWUE, indicating the existence of competitive appropriation behavior in the face of scarcity. Hence, policy measures to conserve groundwater should include supply enhancement to remove the threat of immediate scarcity on farm to avoid inefficient pumping in addition to demand management measures and improved governance.

This interesting shift of the consumption pattern from conventional food products to new differentiated products that incorporate innovative features, consist the main reasoning of the present study. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the drivers that influence the adoption of those differentiated food products and shed new light on consumer's behavior, by modeling and understanding better their attitude. Design/methodology/approach - A two-step cluster analysis was employed to explore the different levels of differentiated products adoption and a categorical regression model was estimated to explain this variation. Data were collected through a survey addressing 500 consumers, carried out in 2009 in a typical Greek urban area. Findings - From the three different food product categories (organic, functional and genetically modified) four consumers' profiles were identified which were found to differ in terms of several socioeconomic characteristics. The increased level of disposable income, along with exposure to innovative food products, may well explain such a differential food product adoption. Research limitations/implications - Due to the small sample, the indefinable number of food products adopters (population) and to specific characteristics of the study area consumers, the results might face generalisability deficiencies. Practical implications - From a practical point of view, to identify the reasons driving consumers to adopt or not new differentiated products with novelties is important generally for society, policy makers, food-producing companies and related economic sectors. Originality/value - The contribution of this research is in having examined, the adoption drivers of differentiated food product categories, for which there has been longstanding interest. The food product categories are examined comparatively as a group (organic, functional and genetically modified) and not individually.","[Loizou, Efstratios] Technol Educ Inst Western Macedonia, Dept Agr Prod Mkt & Qual Control, Florina, Greece; [Michailidis, Anastasios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios] Technol Educ Inst Western Macedonia, Dept Agr Prod Mkt & Qual Control, Florina, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Michailidis, A (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",tassosm@auth.gr,"Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/E-3450-2017; Μιχαηλίδης, Αναστάσιος/AAC-9552-2019; Loizou, Efstratios/S-4313-2019; Loizou, Efstratios/AAJ-9792-2021; Loizou, Efstratios/CAC-9240-2022; Michailidis, Anastasios Ch./B-3537-2010","Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/0000-0003-2008-1023; Loizou, Efstratios/0000-0002-9779-0226; Loizou, Efstratios/0000-0002-9779-0226; Michailidis, Anastasios Ch./0000-0002-7560-4365",,,,,71,21,21,1,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach A total of 379 surveys were collected (342 deemed usable) from respondents who had experienced dining out in a fast-casual restaurant at least once within one month prior to the survey collection time. A research model was tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the research hypotheses. Findings-Results of the study revealed that both hedonic and utilitarian values significantly influenced satisfaction and behavioural intentions. Besides, satisfaction was also found to have a significant positive influence on behavioural intentions. The study also showed that utilitarian value has a more powerful influence on the behavioural intention of customers in the context of fast food restaurants. Research limitations/implications-The main limitation of this study pertains to the sample which is collected from a limited section of the society with high level of education. This study helps to expand the body of literature on the behaviour of young customers in developing countries. Besides, the current study has also contributed to theory by examining the usefulness of two distinct structures of consumer service values, namely hedonic and utilitarian. Practical implications-This study expands the understanding of owners/managers in the food and hospitality industry about the influence of distinct value types on customers' satisfaction and behavioural intentions. Originality/value-This study examined two distinct structures of consumer service values on the behavioural intentions of customers from a developing country. Since the structure of the fast food industry is different from most other countries, in that none of the giant fast food chain restaurants operate in Iran, the results of this study can provide invaluable insights from a different perspective.","[Nejati, Mehran] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town, Malaysia; [Moghaddam, Parnia Parakhodi] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Business Management, Tehran, Iran",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Islamic Azad University,"Nejati, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town, Malaysia.",Mehran.nejati@gmail.com,"Nejati, Mehran/E-8972-2012","Nejati, Mehran/0000-0002-1199-8617",Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [0007-070X],Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)(Universiti Sains Malaysia),The first author would like to acknowledge the support of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) by 0007-070X providing Vice-Chancellor Award.,,76,34,36,5,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Substantial opportunity costs of informal eldercare in terms of forgone labor opportunities have been identified, yet the effects seem to differ substantially across states and there is a controversy on the effects in the Nordic welfare states. In this study, the effects of informal care on the probability of being employed, the number of hours worked, and wages in Norway are analyzed using data from the Life cOurse, Generation, and Gender survey. New and previously suggested instrumental variables are used to control for the potential endogeneity existing between informal care and employment-related outcomes. In total, being an informal caregiver in Norway is found to entail substantially less costs in terms of forgone formal employment opportunities than in non-Nordic welfare states.","[Kotsadam, Andreas] Norwegian Social Res, N-0208 Oslo, Norway; [Kotsadam, Andreas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Kotsadam, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Social Res, POB 3223, N-0208 Oslo, Norway.",ako@nova.no,,,,,,,30,16,17,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Within this paper I analyse four indicator approaches that could be used: (1) Gross Domestic Product, (2) the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, (3) biophysical and social indicators, and (4) a composite indicator. I conclude that separate biophysical and social indicators represent the best approach, but a unifying conceptual framework is required to choose appropriate indicators and interpret the relationships between them. I propose a framework based on ends and means, and a set of biophysical and social indicators within this framework. The biophysical indicators are derived from Herman Daly's definition of a steady state economy, and measure the major stocks and flows in the economy-environment system. The social indicators are based on the stated goals of the degrowth movement, and measure the functioning of the socio-economic system, and how effectively it delivers well-being. 1 discuss some potential applications of the indicators, including a method that allows national economies to be placed into one of five categories: desirable growth, undesirable growth, desirable degrowth. undesirable degrowth, and a steady state economy.

Business and civil society actors play a dominant role in initiating and governing 'sustainable supply chain governance systems' (SSCG systems). Within specific product markets we see the emergence of various competing SSCG systems. This has led to debates on effectiveness, transparency and legitimacy of these forms of self-governance in the market. These developments also call for a debate on appropriate roles for (national) governments. Most of the academic literature in this field focuses on methodologies for supply chain governance and their impacts, but hardly addresses the roles taken on by governments and effectiveness of possible government interventions. This article combines analysis of market dynamics in the timber and coffee product chains with policy analysis, integrating approaches from the research fields of sustainable business and policy analysis. The article shows how competition between various sustainable supply chain governance systems in The Netherlands has resulted in recent market breakthroughs, while initially government interventions were very limited and diverse. The article suggests an approach for more systematic analysis of these dynamics and the roles of various actors, by identifying both the 'public policy cycle' and the 'private policy cycle'.

Specifically, we investigate how and why consumers may transition toward adopting and using new pro-environmental technologies (PETs), namely electric vehicles, solar panels, and a green electricity program. We build a conceptual framework from lifestyle theory, where lifestyle is defined as a grouping of related practices that can reflect and inform the consumer's self-concept (or identity). We apply this framework using a novel quantitative survey method, implemented with a representative sample of 711 San Diego households. Through factor analysis, we identify engagement in pro-environmental practices as independent of engagement in other lifestyle types. We then group respondents into five clusters based on lifestyle engagement, attitudes and openness to lifestyle change (liminality). The three clusters with green attitudes (greens) vary substantially by interest in PETs. Engaged and aspiring greens are attracted to all three PETs, while low-tech greens report mild interest in green electricity only. Non-green techies only report interest in solar panels, while traditionalists report uniformly low PET interest. Results demonstrate the relevance of lifestyle theory, and provide a unique, empirical application that can improve understandings of opportunities and barriers to sustainable consumption.

The existing literature that addresses this question uses a difference-in-difference estimation technique. We contribute to this literature in two ways. First, we argue that this estimation technique can produce misleading results due to (a) the possibility of multiplicity of equilibria and (b) the non-linearity of the underlying econometric model. Second, we develop an empirical strategy to identify the mechanism by which the legislation affected child labor decisions. In particular, besides establishing whether the legislation was effective or not, our analysis may determine whether the legislation constituted a benign policy or not, i.e., whether the legislation constrained the behavior of families (not benign) or whether it changed the labor market to a new equilibrium in which families voluntarily respected the law (benign).","Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Bugni, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",federico.bugni@duke.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,2,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2012,6.0,3,,,,,223.0,248,,10.1007/s11698-011-0073-4,0.0,,,26,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,992IM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307768900001,0

Fishing at low stock sizes means borrowing from the natural asset. While fishing a particular quantity generates immediate profits and income, an interest rate has to be paid in terms of foregone future fishing income, as the fish stock's reproductive capacity remains low and fishing costs stay high. in this paper we propose to apply the concept of shadow interest rate to quantify the degree of overfishing. It incorporates the relevant biological and economic information and compares across fish stocks. We calculate the shadow interest rates for 13 major European fish stocks and find these rates to range from 10% to more than 200%. The concept of the shadow interest rate can be used to make the economic consequences of overfishing transparent and to evaluate the profitability of short-term catch reductions as investments in natural capital stocks.

Significant changes in the interactions between natural and physical capital accumulation give rise to processes of structural change (SC) which affect not only sectoral composition of the productive system, but also social equity and environmental quality. We propose a taxonomy of different SCs on the basis of distributive, environmental and economic outcomes and we study a two-sector model with environmental externalities to identify under which conditions each SC can occur. Our model shows how the type of SC is shaped by the link between agents' heterogeneity in terms of productive asset endowment and their vulnerability to environmental degradation. In particular, we find that a SC associated with reduction in poverty and in environmental pressures can occur only if productivity of the physical capital-intensive sector increases but its rate of environmental impact remains relatively lower than that of the natural-capital intensive sector.

We develop a modelling approach for the economic valuation of annual Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) extraction at a large spatial scale, which has 4 main strengths: (1) it is based on household production functions using data of actual household behaviour, (2) it is spatially sensitive, using a range of explanatory variables related to socio-demographic characteristics, population density, resource availability and accessibility, (3) it captures the value of the actual flow rather than the potential stock, and (4) it is generic and can therefore be up-scaled across non-surveyed areas. We illustrate the empirical application of this approach in an analysis of charcoal production in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania, using a dataset comprising over 1100 observations from 45 villages. The total flow of charcoal benefits is estimated at USD 14 million per year, providing an important source of income to local households, and supplying around 11% of the charcoal used in Dar es Salaam and other major cities. We discuss the potential and limitations of up-scaling micro-level analysis for NTFP valuation. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We employ non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) on various input/output combinations, focusing on sales and market value as output measures in the construction of the frontier technologies. Using these performance measures, we examine whether efficient firms perform differently from inefficient firms following standard financial analysis procedures. First, we employ performance attribution regressions, by forming portfolios based on efficiency scores and tracking the performance of the various portfolios over time. Second, we perform cross-sectional/panel regressions to determine whether firm efficiency indeed has explanatory power for the cross-section of stock returns. Our results suggest that firm efficiency plays an important role in asset pricing and that efficient firms significantly outperform inefficient firms even after controlling for known risk factors.","[Frijns, Bart] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Auckland 1020, New Zealand; [Margaritis, Dimitris] Univ Auckland, Dept Accounting & Finance, Sch Business, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Psillaki, Maria] Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece",Auckland University of Technology; University of Auckland; University of Piraeus,"Frijns, B (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1020, New Zealand.",bfrijns@aut.ac.nz,"Frijns, Bart/U-5613-2019; Psillaki, Maria/ABD-4999-2020; Margaritis, Dimitris/E-6114-2013","Frijns, Bart/0000-0002-6586-1042; Psillaki, Maria/0000-0002-2424-4208; Margaritis, Dimitris/0000-0001-5056-1170",,,,,21,24,28,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The authors argued that logarithmic transformation cannot be used when variables are dimensional, presented several examples of purportedly incorrect use in applied economics and ecological economics publications, and concluded that these applications make no sense. In this paper we show that this view goes against well established theory and practice of many disciplines including physics, statistics, biology, and economics, and rests on an inadequate understanding of dimensional homogeneity and the nature of empirical modeling in applied sciences. We believe that it is important to clarify that the use of dimensional variables in transcendental functions is in fact in accordance with the established scientific consensus so as to prevent further confusion from arising in ecological economics where addressing complex problems requires the synthesis of insights from many diverse disciplines to further our understanding of the environment-economy interface. We also provide novel applications of dimensional methods to ecological economics and useful methodological references from several strands of scientific literature, not previously systematically consolidated, that should be of interest to every applied researcher.

This article places this literature in the context of the policymaking goals of the CDM's Brazilian architects. The CDM arose from the Brazilian Proposal's Clean Development Fund, and was negotiated between Brazil and the United States in the weeks preceding the Kyoto Conference of Parties. The CDM's Brazilian architects continued to pursue their underlying policy goals by taking a leadership position in the Marrakesh Accords negotiations. During this period Brazil's primary policy objectives comprised achieving meaningful mitigation of GHG emissions to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system, derailing a perceived US/IPCC initiative to allocate emissions cap obligations in the Kyoto Protocol on the basis of current emissions, and taking a leadership position both among the G-77 and China and in the multilateral climate negotiations as a whole. The CDM arose in this context from the G-77 and China's desire to coerce the North's compliance with the North's emissions cap obligations through an alternative means of compliance. As a result, there was no focus on broad conceptions of sustainable development, or on broad distribution of CDM projects throughout the South. Instead, the CDM's Brazilian architects envisioned that CDM-related sustainable development would arise exclusively from the presence of the CDM projects. Similarly, the Brazilian Proposal advocated allocation of the Clean Development Fund on a basis proportionate to each non-Annex I countries projected 1990-2010 greenhouse gas emissions. These views persisted through the evolution of the Clean Development Fund into the CDM and through Marrakesh Accords negotiations. This article argues that the CDM has largely met the policy goals of its Brazilian architects and that the pursuit of different, additional, refined or more nuanced policy goals necessitates corresponding refinements to the CDM, or any successor mechanism, specifically targeting those different, additional, refined or more nuanced policy objectives, lending support to the emerging literature proposing changes to the CDM to pursue corresponding policy objectives.","[Cole, John C.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Cole, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Hayes House,75 George St, Oxford OX1 2BQ, England.",john.cole@linacre.oxon.org,"Zhang, Rachel/B-6591-2012",,,,,,81,13,14,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Recent articles obtain results showing respondents to the right of the political spectrum are significantly less likely to vote in favour of environmental programs that provide public goods through public means. In consequence, their WTP is lower than that of individuals on the political left. We examine whether WTP differs systematically in accordance with political affiliation by using data from three stated preference surveys. We obtain results similar to the previous literature from only one survey. Our other two surveys employ different contexts that change the nature of the benefits from the good and/or its provision mechanism. The first of these finds no significant differences in WTP by respondent political affiliation and the second finds that respondents on the right of the political spectrum have statistically higher WTPs for a good when it is privately provided than under collective provision. Our results provide further support that context matters and that preferences elicited from surveys for environmental goods are not necessarily independent of the means by which the good is provided.

This paper draws on the involvement of ecological economists in cross-cultural research in New Zealand, to distill insights on how ecological economists can usefully and legitimately engage with indigenous peoples in environmental research. The main bodies of western ecological knowledge are reviewed and compared with indigenous knowledge, illuminating the main similarities, differences and challenges. This leads into a broader analysis of how these different 'knowledge systems' can be mobilised to provide cross-cultural environmental research of practical use to indigenous peoples. Accordingly, principles, characteristics, and structures of applied cross-cultural environmental research are discussed, not as a prescriptive template but as suggestions for future researchers. We conclude that Ecological Economics is well placed to embrace the perspectives and frameworks of indigenous and western knowledge systems. We strongly assert, however, that methodological pluralism needs to be practiced, not just preached. Ecological economists need to resist 'knowledge imperialism' and even 'knowledge integration' (except where appropriate), which has sometimes been the case in the recent Ecological Economics literature.

It is based on a model of the economy as a two-stage materials/energy processing system. Growth is simulated by a two-parameter production function with two traditional factors, labor and capital, and a non-traditional factor, namely 'useful work'. The non-traditional factor is calculated from primary energy inputs multiplied by an empirically estimated average energy conversion efficiency, which is a function of changing technology over time. This model 'explains' past US growth from 1900 through 1973-74 with satisfactory accuracy but it slightly underestimates subsequent growth (i.e. it leaves a small unexplained but increasing residual) for the period after 1975. However, by subdividing capital stock into traditional and ICT components, we are able to extend the theory to explain US economic growth accurately. In this paper we also extend the results to Japan. The revised production function has only three independent parameters. The new model also has implications for future economic growth, energy and environmental policy that differ significantly from the traditional growth theory. These implications are discussed briefly.

Design/methodology/approach - After the exploration of consumers' impressions of thawed fish, this study followed a pair-wise comparison approach in a central location consumer test. Fish fillets were evaluated on liking, smell and texture by means of a questionnaire with additional behavioural and attitudinal questions. Findings - This study showed that consumers in England may prefer thawed over fresh cod fillets without information. However, consumers' evaluations increased for labelled fresh cod fillets and decreased for thawed. Finally, consumers reported positive expectations about fillets labelled fresh or frozen at sea. Research limitation/implications - This study involved testing cod fillets in a central location test. Consumers do not usually evaluate cod fillets in this way in their daily life. The quality of the two types of fillets made especially for this test may vary compared to the ones usually sold and consumed. Practical implications - This study can inform producers and retailers about what to expect by means of sales of fresh and thawed cod products with or without information. Social implications - It was shown that consumers are positively influenced by information and are willing to consume more fish if they know that the fish is fresh or thawed properly.

Design/methodology/approach - The sample was drawn from an internet panel maintained by Markettools, Inc, a respected market research company in the USA. A total of 594 respondents were surveyed. Besides demographic questions, respondents were asked about their knowledge of nine nutrients. Basic nutrient knowledge was estimated through a one-sample t-test tested against a value of two on a 1-4 scale. Respondents evaluated eight benefit statements regarding the health benefits of mushrooms. After reading each statement, respondents indicated their likelihood of purchasing fresh mushrooms and were asked about the believability, favorability, and uniqueness of each statement. Findings - The results indicate that health-related food benefit claims are better accepted by female respondents who claim to be nutritionally knowledgeable and who are older. Three hypotheses related to nutritional knowledge and beliefs showed that knowledge and beliefs have an effect but the effect varied by nutrient and nutrient cluster. In particular, knowledge of esoteric nutrients such as Pantothenic Acid was associated with acceptance of health-related claims. Practical implications - Food marketers are spending millions of dollars/pounds/euros on informing people of the nutrient content and health benefits of their foods. However, this money can be better spent if one first understands the existing levels of nutritional knowledge and the specific nutrients that motivate change in preference or buying intention. Originality/value - This paper builds on the existing body of knowledge using additional statistical techniques to cluster nutrients and to provide a demonstration on a fresh produce food group not currently investigated in the literature. It suggests that food marketers need to gather more information on their consumers to target their health and nutrition message to the proper (more receptive) audience.","[Stanton, John L.] St Josephs Univ, Dept Food Mkt, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; [Baglione, Stephen L.] St Leo Univ, Sch Business, St Leo, FL USA; [Tucci, Louis A.] Coll New Jersey, Dept Mkt, Ewing, NJ USA",Saint Joseph's University; Saint Leo University; College of New Jersey,"Stanton, JL (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Dept Food Mkt, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",jstanton@sju.edu,,,,,,,66,13,15,0,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In my research I have studied programs and projects held and supported by government of Georgia in migration management. I also surveyed Georgian emigrants in Czech Republic and potential emigrants in Georgia. The survey showed me various expectations of qualified emigrants and level of their main emigration aim fulfillment. After analyzing the survey results I was able to determine inadequacy in government and emigrants activities on the way of realizing their anticipations. In conclusion I generated some important recommendations for Georgian government for constructive approaches in optimization of qualified labor resource migration management.","[Laliashvili, Zurab] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,zlaliashvili@seznam.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,646.0,656,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500060,0

In this comment we show that, although the general approach proposed in their paper deserves to be pursued, the method by which they use competitive conservation tenders to derive the value of environmental goods and services as well as their contribution to national GDP is theoretically flawed. We provide and discuss an alternative, theoretically consistent method. Although in this case the contribution of auction-generated values to GDP turns out to be (much) smaller than calculated in their paper, the capacity of market-based instruments to add value to GDP is not called into question.

The theoretical model we derive from Cobb-Douglas production and inverse demand functions predict that in conducting GHG emissions management, a firm will enhance its economic performance because it promotes an increase in demand for its output and improves its productivity. The estimation results, using panel data on Japanese manufacturing firms during the period 2007-2008, support the view that a firm's GHG emissions management enhances a firm's economic performance through an increase in demand and improvement in productivity. However, the latter effect is conditional. Although a firm's efforts to maintain lower GHG emissions improves productivity, efforts to reduce GHG emissions further does not always improve it, especially for energy-intensive firms. Because firms attempting to maintain lower GHG emissions are more likely to improve their productivity, there is a possibility that firms with high GHG emissions can also enhance economic performance by reducing their emissions in the long term, even if additional costs are incurred. In addition, better GHG emissions management increases the demand of environmentally conscious customers because a product's life cycle GHG emissions in the upper stream of the supply chain influence those in the lower stream, and customers evaluate the suppliers' GHG emissions management in terms of green supply-chain management.","[Nishitani, Kimitaka] Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Kaneko, Shinji] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, Higashihiroshima 7398529, Japan; [Komatsu, Satoru] Nagasaki Univ, Sch Global Humanities & Social Sci, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan; [Fujii, Hidemichi] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci & Environm Studies, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan",Kobe University; Hiroshima University; Nagasaki University; Nagasaki University,"Nishitani, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",kimitakan@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Komatsu, Satoru/M-4450-2013; Fujii, Hidemichi/E-8261-2014; Kaneko, Shinji/G-5913-2012","Fujii, Hidemichi/0000-0002-3043-1122; Kaneko, Shinji/0000-0002-9026-5728",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26740057] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,42,26,26,0,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We empirically evaluated these assumptions with a map-based interview protocol to characterize what can be managed (ES and related activities), what matters (benefits) and why (valueS). Based on interviews with residents of coastal communities in British Columbia, 87% of responses to cultural ES interview prompts conveyed bundles of linked services, benefits and values. Many ES-related values (e.g., transformative and identity) matter in ways that are not adequately expressed using market or non-market valuation. Respondents used diverse metaphors about why the ocean is important, not only the ES production metaphor, which assumes that values are a function of ecosystem processes. Our research demonstrates the utility of our interview protocol for providing a fuller representation of ecosystem-related values and benefits, potentially informing environmental decision-making processes.

The approach captures ecosystem dynamics from extinction debt, as well as ecological and climatic risks at the project scale. Climatic risks are introduced through three channels: the effects of climate change on species loss, future rehabilitation benefits and frequency of catastrophic events. Our results suggest that allocating voluntary rehabilitation contracts on the basis of real options criteria increases cost-efficiency and delivers greater value for money for the Government when compared with the conventional cost-effectiveness criterion as it is illustrated for the case of Box Gum Grassy Woodland rehabilitation in Australia.

These contracts regulate the exchange of peculiar ecosystem services (genetic and biological materials) between a provider and a recipient of the service. The paper uses a set of model contracts from the late 2000s, gathered from the U.N. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD). Empirical results show that the probability that a payment scheme is included in the contract negatively depends on the presence of an acknowledgment obligation to the provider of the material. Probably aware of the complexity and uncertainty of the recipient's research activity, the provider (and the CBD) requires to be compensated through the recognition of his/her important input to the research venture. In economics, this can be interpreted as payment in terms of moral satisfaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This has implications for the appropriate design and use of such incentive-based programs. This study investigates motivational crowding out in the case of conservation auctions, a relatively new tool that provides monetary incentives to encourage landowners to adopt environmentally friendly management practices. Our experimental evidence shows that the introduction and subsequent removal of a conservation auction significantly reduces voluntary provision of environmental quality (via monetary donations to an environmental charity), compared to a control group that does not experience an auction. We also attempt to examine some economic theories of behavior that explain this effect according to either individual motivations or social interactions, and our initial exploration finds that crowding out occurs regardless of whether or not participants have opportunities to interact with one another during the experiment.

Tax policy is approximated by average effective tax rates on foreign investment, taking into account the tax incentives available to foreign investors. In line with the predictions of the theoretical tax competition literature, we also highlight the impact of each province's characteristics (including its size and level of industrialization) on the strategic interaction with its neighbors.

Non-additional services are those that would have been provided without the payment. One source of non-additionality is farmer misrepresentation of their pre-program management. Farm management practices are often difficult to observe, particularly those that do not involve structural changes, such as nutrient management If practices are difficult to observe, management oversight lax, and enforcement weak, the farmer has an incentive to provide biased information that increases the likelihood that he will receive a more favorable baseline for calculating services created, and a larger payment. This is a moral hazard problem. The presence of non-additional credits in a water quality trading program can result in the degradation of water quality. Point source discharges above permitted levels are replaced by equivalent reductions from unregulated nonpoint sources. If the abatement that point sources purchase from nonpoint sources is non-additional, discharges will be higher than if the abatement was truly additional. Preventing non-additional credits from entering a water quality trading market is one of the goals of program design. In this paper we assess how program eligibility baseline choice affects the incentive to misrepresent baseline nutrient management practices.

We explore the consistency or discrepancy among stakeholder groups involved in the risk and control management of invasive species to identify the extent to which different factors influence stakeholder choices of major relevant plant invaders. Based on stakeholder ranking of invasive plants, we explore the reasons behind stakeholders' support for policy management. Data were collected in Galicia, Spain. A national catalogue of prohibited entry and trade of invasive species has been recently approved. We estimate a rank ordered logit model using information from semi-structured interviews conducted with respondents from four stakeholder groups: public administration sector, ornamental sector, research and social groups. The characteristics of plant invaders that provoke stakeholders to rank a species more highly are wide distribution of plant invaders, existence of public control programmes, use and sale of species in the ornamental sector and media coverage. The influence these aspects have in the selection of top-ranked invaders varies across different stakeholder groups and with stakeholders' level of knowledge, awareness and attitudes towards different potential policy measures. A small group of invaders are perceived as top rated by all stakeholder groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Services seem to flow effortlessly from ecosystems to beneficiaries, as free gifts of nature. We integrate such processes, strengthening the model's applicability to non-incremental changes, and to landscape planning. A process analysis shows how use value attribution turns biophysical ecosystem functions into ecosystem service potentials which (except for 'final services') have to be mobilised to provide ecosystem services. Once appropriated, these services generate ecosystem benefits which may be commercialised, or not. The important role of use value attribution for the final (e)valuation of policies, plans and their expected outcome is illustrated by discussing different service potentials attributed to the same function, biomass provision, and the different bioenergy services resulting. For the reverse use of the 'cascade' as 'stairways' for planning processes, the prevailing uncertainty requires legal and participative foundations for decision making, and an awareness of the potentially conflicting private and public interests involved. This reverse application combines with the 'cascade' to form a full cycle of ecosystem services generation and management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the problem of short-term surveillance for an invasive species in a geographical environment. We find the optimal allocation of surveillance resources among multiple geographical subdivisions via application of a classical portfolio framework, which allocates investments among multiple financial asset types with uncertain returns in a portfolio that maximizes the performance and, by meeting the desired diversification targets, protects against errors in estimating the portfolio's performance. We illustrate the approach with a case study that applies a spatial transmission model to assess the risk of spread of the emerald ash borer (EAB), a significant pest in North America, with infested firewood that may be carried by visitors to campground facilities in central Canada. Adding the diversification objective yields an expected survey performance that is comparable with undiversified optimal allocation, but more importantly, makes the geographical distribution of survey priorities less subject to possible errors in the spread rate estimates. Overall, diversification of pest surveillance can be viewed as a viable short-term strategy for hedging against uncertainty in expert- and model-based assessments of pest invasion risk.

However, this assumption has been questioned by researchers, who instead argue that people may live better lives by consuming less and reduce their environmental impact in the process. In this study we explore the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and subjective well-being, using a sample of 1000 Swedish respondents. Our results show that there is no strong link between an individual's emissions and subjective wellbeing. We also analyze the relationship between specific emission-intensive activities and subjective well-being and find that none of the activities examined correlates with subjective well-being. Finally, we explore a hypothesis put forward in the literature, suggesting that a poor work-life balance, long commuting distances, and materialistic values may decrease individuals' subjective well-being and increase greenhouse gas emissions. Our results indicate that materialistic values do correlate with lower levels of well-being and to some extent also with higher greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to New Deal spending, political variables explain very little of the variation in EOA funding.

Using data from 1996 to 2005, we examine whether insurance instability has implications for access to primary care. Because unobserved factors related to parental behavior and child health may affect both the stability of coverage and utilization, we estimate the relationship between insurance and the probability that a child has at least one physician visit per year using a model that includes child fixed effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity. Although we find that unobserved heterogeneity is an important factor influencing cross-sectional correlations, conditioning on child fixed effects we find a statistically and economically significant relationship between insurance coverage stability and access to care. Children who have part-year public or private insurance are more likely to have at least one doctor's visit than children who are uninsured for a full year, but less likely than children with full-year coverage. We find comparable effects for public and private insurance. Although cross-sectional analyses suggest that transitions directly between public and private insurance are associated with lower rates of utilization, the evidence of such an effect is much weaker when we condition on child fixed effects.","[Buchmueller, Thomas] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Buchmueller, Thomas] Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Buchmueller, Thomas; Shore-Sheppard, Lara] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Orzol, Sean M.] Mathematica Policy Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Shore-Sheppard, Lara] Williams Coll, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; Mathematica; Williams College,"Buchmueller, T (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tbuch@umich.edu; sorzol@mathematica-mpr.com; lara.d.shore-sheppard@williams.edu,,"Buchmueller, Thomas/0000-0002-3068-7419",,,,,15,10,11,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

We take a sector perspective based on neo Schumpeterian theory that emphasises the role of both sector and innovation systems. We interpret results taking into account sector and country based institutional, market and policy conditions. Econometric outcomes, based on an original sector dataset which exploits the NAMEA source for 15 European Union (EU) countries and 23 manufacturing sectors in the time frame 1995-2006, show that innovation efforts are positively correlated to various spillover effects. Those effects include the emissions abatement of the other sectors, thus pointing out the relevance of forces which opposite typical free riding behaviour in public or mixed public good frameworks. Different reactivity strengths for different global and local emissions also allow us to disclose the specific role of technological and economic complementarity. When considering CO2 emissions, innovation is mainly triggered by national interactions, a fact which is coherent with a dominance of national innovation and policy systems in the EU. The result is also consistent with the fact that CO2 abatement technologies heavily regard energy efficiency that provides joint private and public benefits. The fact that NMVOC abatement efforts by other sectors from abroad impact R&D investments positively means that, in some cases, a realm of sectoral systems of innovation is also relevant. The different evidence between local and global externalities is surely explained not only by the different technological and economic contents, but also by the fact that the EU has witnessed different policy implementation.

Such models have also been used in reserve site selection modeling. They aim at selecting sites to conserve species, sometimes reflecting a desire to group protected sites together or to separate sites. This paper uses such models but considers the case of land heterogeneity in terms of the risk of large disturbances that threaten species even within a reserve, such as fires, diseases, pests or invasive species. It removes the classical assumption of homogeneous land sites and considers both adjacency in areas with a low risk of multi-parcel disturbance and distance between sites in areas with a high risk of a large destructive event. The models are explored in a stylized data set and applied to a portion of the state of Oregon with comparison between the standard covering models in homogeneous and heterogeneous risk settings.

Incorporated into traditional economic models, such values can offer potential insight on programmatic efficiency and help to inform policy tradeoffs within and between competing methods. For this analysis, acreage trajectories and cost functions are developed for dredge- and diversion-based land reclamation methods in coastal Louisiana, USA. Benefit-cost models are constructed from which ecosystem service values are initially derived via break-even analysis and then specified to inform comparative case studies. Results indicate that the minimum service value required to offset project expenditures is typically higher for natural diversion-based restoration relative to rapid dredge-based methods under historic project conditions. Accounting for climatological and socioeconomic risks widens this gap, with benefit-cost ratios for dredge-based reclamation exceeding that of diversions in 16 benefit-cost simulations conducted over a 50-year project horizon. Taken together, these results highlight the influence of time and risk in the assessment of competing project alternatives, and suggest the need to reframe restoration efficiency in terms of the aggregate flow of ecosystem services, versus the per unit costs of terminal stocks.

This paper explores the impacts of date of birth and income on household CO2 emissions in France and in the USA. Direct CO2 emissions of French and American households are computed from consumer budget surveys, over the 1980-2000 time period. Age Period Cohort estimators are used to isolate the generational effect on CO2 emissions - i.e. the specific effect of date of birth, independent of the age, the year and other control variables. The paper shows that French 1935-55 cohorts have a stronger tendency to emit CO2 than their predecessors and followers. The generational effect is explained by the fact that over their lifespan, French baby boomers are better off than other generations and live in energy and carbon inefficient dwellings. In the USA, the absence of a generational effect on CO2 emissions can be explained by the fact that intergenerational income inequalities are weaker than in France. Persistence of the generational effect once income and housing type is controlled for in France can be explained by the difficulty for French 1935-55 cohorts to adapt to sober energy consumption patterns.

As a first step, more precise calculation of crop water use is essential. Crop water use, also known as crop evapotranspiration (ETc), is influenced by the prevailing meteorological conditions, available moisture in the soil, crop species and growth stage. The influence of the meteorological conditions on crop water needs is given by the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) and the relationship between the ETc and ETo is termed as the crop coefficient (K-c). The K-c values are affected by agro-meteorological factors, soil characteristics and the agronomic techniques that affect crop growth. Consequently, the use of Kc values developed in other regions may need modification to accurately estimate crop water requirements. Thus, the development of region-based K-c values could be used to accurately estimate crop needs and such values can reliably be determined using weighing lysimeters. A weighing lysimeter was installed at the experimental farm of the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA), Dubai, UAE (25 degrees 06'31 '' N; 55 degrees 22'59 '' E). Two potential forage crops of this region, namely pearl millet and sorghum, were tested in the lysimeter during 2008 and 2011, respectively. The data from the weighing lysimeter provided ETc values of the tested crops. The ETo values were calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation using the weather data of the ICBA. The obtained singled (time-averaged) K-c values of pearl millet were 0.28, 1.04, and 0.59 for the initial, mid-season and late-season growth stages, respectively. For sorghum, the corresponding K-c values of three growth stages were 0.65, 1.10, and 0.88, respectively. These values can be used in developing K-c curves for predicting ETc.","[Akhand, N.

Irrigation of greenhouse crops is mainly managed by farmer's experiences. The main objective of this study was to identify the cucumber water requirement inside greenhouses located in an arid region in comparison to the outside requirement. Two different structures of greenhouses, seawater and conventional greenhouse were used in this study. Four lysimeters were installed in each greenhouse. Irrigation was controlled and scheduled based on drainage collected at the bottom of the lysimeters. Sensors of relative humidity, temperature and solar radiation were installed at three different locations inside each greenhouse. Wind speed was measured manually using hand held anemometer. Outside weather parameters were obtained from a weather station installed outside of each location. Class A evaporation pans were installed both inside and outside of each structure. Daily water consumption from both irrigation system and cooling pads was measured using water meters. Daily drainage was also collected from different lysimeters to calculate the actual crop evapotranspiration. Data obtained showed that SWGH structure was able to reduce the ambient temperature by 4.8 degrees C while CGH reduced it by 7.4 degrees C. Both greenhouses increased inside relative humidity by 20-23% more than ambient humidity. Relative humidity inside SWGH was always higher than inside CGH; hence SWGH was more favourable for cucumber growth. Solar radiation inside both structures was always high (4.3-4.7 kW/m(2)) which indicated that shade or different plastic cover is required to reduce solar radiation for better cucumber growth. Penman-monteith (P-M) equation was used to calculate reference evapotranspiration inside CGH and SWGH and the result obtained was an average of 5.5 and 4.3 mm/day respectively. The K-pan factor inside and outside CGH was adjusted based on P-M equation. The results obtained showed that K-pan inside and outside CGH was 0.82 and 0.9 respectively. The value of K-pan outside SWGH was 0.78.","[Al-Busaidi, H. A.; Al-Mulla, Y.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 256 12-year-old Danish schoolchildren took part in a text-message feedback intervention promoting fruit and vegetable consumption. One parent of each child filled out self-administered questionnaires at three points during the 40-week study period. In the questionnaire, stated consumption, perceived influence factors on their consumption and self-efficacy and self-regulation were measured. Findings - Only half of the parents stated that they met the five a day target. These parents reported good availability of fruit and vegetables in their household, high consumption among their friends and frequent exercise and they were characterised by high self-efficacy levels. Stated consumption increased during the period of the intervention targeted at their children. Parents that reported an increase had, at the start of the intervention, reported low levels of consumption, lack of encouragement to eat healthy at their workplace and lower autonomous self-regulation. Research limitations/implications - The consumption data is limited to self-report. Practical implications - The results indicate that parents can be influenced indirectly by school-based interventions targeted at their children. Future interventions should include the family with the intent to support positive interaction that might further promote and sustain healthy eating habits. Originality/value - The study considers the possible effects school interventions targeting children may have on the immediate family, an aspect generally overlooked in school-based health initiatives.","[Aschemann-Witzel, Jessica; Gronhoj, Alice] Aarhus Univ, MAPP Ctr Res Customer Relat Food Sect, Aarhus, Denmark; [Bech-Larsen, Tino] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Adm, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Aschemann-Witzel, J (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, MAPP Ctr Res Customer Relat Food Sect, Aarhus, Denmark.",jeaw@asb.dk,"Grønhøj, Alice/AAC-9154-2019; Aschemann-Witzel, Jessica/HDN-4575-2022; Aschemann-Witzel, Jessica/ABD-5432-2020","Grønhøj, Alice/0000-0002-3837-2059; Aschemann-Witzel, Jessica/0000-0002-6737-3659","Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation [09/061357]","Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation","The authors would like to thank PhD student Susanne Pedersen and the student assistants for their great work during the completion of the study.

This study gives a quantification of global land use, water use and fertilizer use for the year 2050, for a complete diet and four different futures. Agriculture will need to develop substantially to feed future populations. It is shown that there is a negative correlation between fertilizer use and land use, which makes the necessity of incorporating both in such assessments clear. Water use increases relative to total production and this is going to be a problem unless drastic measures are taken, The high wastage and high consumption of animal products in the developed regions are major contributors to the total global demand. Developing countries' aspirations to such practices are a major factor in increases in diet demand, as are population increases in those regions. In creating a more sustainable food system, a one-solution approach will not do and solutions should combine supply-side and demand-side options. Demand-side solutions should target wastage and animal product consumption. On the supply side, technological development and better feeding efficiency will increase yields. Feeding the future global population, which is necessary to increase living standards worldwide, will require a concerted effort. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Odegard, I. Y.

Consumer evaluations of a retailer's performance may form their risk perceptions and positive behavioral intentions toward the retailer. This study aims to extend previous research by proposing an integrative model that examines how three retail performance dimensions (product quality, service quality, and price fairness) influence consumer trust, risk perceptions, and repatronage intentions in the context of organic food retailing. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical data were collected from face-to-face interviews guided by a structural questionnaire. Consumers of organic food retailers located in Taiwan were asked to participate in the research and 416 usable questionnaires were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM) through LISREL 8.70 was used to analyze the data. Findings - Results show that both product quality and price fairness have direct effects on consumer trust, risk perceptions, and indirect effects (through trust in retailer and transaction risk perceptions) on the intent to revisit an organic food retailer. Service quality only affects consumer trust directly, but not perceived transaction risk. In addition, service quality does not have a significant indirect effect on revisit intention. Originality/value - This study is the first to research essential issues for understanding the role of retail performance dimensions on transaction risk perceptions in organic food marketing practices in Taiwan.","[Wang, Edward Shih-Tse; Tsai, Bi-Kun] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Tsai, BK (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",tsai.nchu.edu.tw@gmail.com,"Wang, Edward/JTU-8458-2023; Wang, Edward Shih-Tse/E-5684-2015","Wang, Edward Shih-Tse/0000-0003-1302-9745",,,,,79,29,32,2,54,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The risk of endangerment may be particularly acute for species that exist as metapopulations in which viability of the species is contingent upon dispersal of individuals among local sub-populations. This paper uses an optimization framework to investigate the problem of conserving metapopulations residing in areas at the urban-rural fringe. We compare the optimal allocation of preservation to outcomes of four other policy alternatives including the reserve-site-selection option that fully preserves habitat patches while allowing full development of the intervening dispersal matrix. In general, the optimal allocation includes some amount of preservation in both habitat patches and dispersal matrix, with the level of protection typically greater in habitat patches. The reserve-site-selection conservation option is optimal in only a few cases. Heterogeneity in terms of land use and landscape structure adds complexity to the optimal solution such that no one policy works well across all land units and in situations where the landscape structure is skewed, full protection of some land units and full development of others becomes more common.

We argue that the roots of the Anthropocene lie in the agricultural revolution that began some 8000 years ago. Unique human psychological and cultural characteristics were present in our distant hunter-gatherer past, but in terms of the biophysical impact of our species, agricultural represented an unequivocal and decisive evolutionary break With the transition to agriculture human society began to function as a superorganism functioning as a single unit designed by social natural selection to produce economic surplus. Where environmental conditions were permitted, early human agricultural societies followed the same pattern as a few social insects and exhibited explosive population growth, complex and detailed division of labor, intensive resource exploitation, territorial expansion, and a social organization favoring the survival and growth of the supergroup over the well-being of individuals within the group. Similar economic forces lie behind ultrasociality in social insects and humans increased productivity from the division of labor, increasing returns to scale, and the exploitation of stocks of productive resources. Exploring the evolutionary mechanisms behind ultrasociality offers insights into the growth imperative that threatens the stability of the earth's life support systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In reality, however, the magnitude, sign, and significance of this relationship is not necessarily uniform across all regions of the U.

Consequently, we split our dataset into metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties, into the eight Bureau of Economic Analysis regions, and into regions of different political affiliation and economic-dependence typology.

University sustainability commitments and student experiences of introductory economics,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economics education; University; Sustainability commitment; Student,WELFARE ECONOMICS; HIGHER-EDUCATION; PRINCIPLES,"The three largest public universities in British Columbia, Canada have signed the Talloires Declaration, committing themselves to promoting sustainability and creating expectations that they will integrate sustainability across the curriculum in order to improve students' environmental literacy and stewardship. About 40% of North American university students take a mainstream introductory economics course; few of these students take economics at more advanced levels. As such, introductory economics courses are an important vehicle for students to learn economic theory; they have the potential to contribute to the knowledge that students can mobilize to foster sustainability. Interviews were held with 54 students who had recently completed an introductory level mainstream economics course at one of the three universities. Students reported that introductory economics courses place little emphasis on the environment and sustainability, they recalled course content with normative connotations that are problematic from a sustainability perspective and they described how discussion of the limitations of mainstream theory was set aside. Student reports of the insights introductory economics offers into environmental problems imply that these courses are failing to substantively increase students' understanding of sustainability and linkages between the environment and the economy. Findings suggest that current introductory economics curriculum undermines the universities' sustainability commitments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, as demand continues to increase and climate change threatens to alter hydrological cycles, water scarcity is a growing problem. Does research into virtual water trade need to consider water scarcity and differentiate flows out of water-scarce regions from flows out of water-abundant regions? Previous studies sum and compare virtual water volumes originating in countries experiencing vastly different degrees of water scarcity. We therefore incorporate water scarcity into an assessment of global virtual water flows. We use input-output analysis to include indirect virtual water flows. We find that the structure of global virtual water networks changes significantly after adjusting for water scarcity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports an economic valuation study conducted in Yunnan, China, which estimates the total value of a real investment project to improve the water quality of Lake Puzhehei by one grade level. Located in Qiubei County far from big cities, the lake has been experiencing rapid water quality deterioration in past several years. Based on the multiple bounded discrete choice approach, an average household in Qiubei County is estimated to be willing to pay 30 yuan per month continuously for 5 years for the water quality improvement by one grade level, roughly equivalent to 3% of the average household income. The elasticity of willingness-to-pay with respect to income is estimated to be 0.21. The economic rate of return of the proposed project is estimated to be 18%, indicating an economically favorable investment in water quality improvement. This study also demonstrates that the previous knowledge about the water quality changes and about the project can have significant positive impacts on people's willingness to pay, whereas the interviewer effect on valuation can be negative.

With multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), ecological economics offers a useful tool for environmental questions but mostly case-specific criteria are applied. This, however, makes it difficult to compare findings. Therefore, we present a systematic framework that includes the ecosystem services as criteria into MCDA. The ecological quantification of the provided ecosystem services is combined with the assigned importance of the single ecosystem services. In a case study from the central Alps, we compared three land-use alternatives resulting from land-use change caused by socio-economic pressures: traditional larch (Larix decidua) meadow, spruce forest (abandonment) and intensive meadow (intensification). Criteria for the MCDA model were selected by experts, criteria importance was ranked by stakeholders and criteria values were assessed with qualitative and quantitative indicators. Eventually spruce forest was ranked as the best land-use alternative followed by traditional larch meadow and intensive meadow. The combined approach of MCDA using ecosystem services as criteria showed how criteria weightings and criteria indicator values influence land-use alternatives' performance. The MCDA-model visualizes the consequences of land-use change for ecosystem service provision, facilitating landscape planning by structuring environmental problems and providing data for decisions.

The analysis is at the farm level and includes two different categories of the animals, ewes (adult females) and lambs with a crucial distinction between the outdoor grazing season and the winter indoor season. The model is formulated in a Nordic economic and biological setting. During the outdoor grazing season, animals may experience growth constraints as a result of limited grazing resources. The available grazing resources are determined by animal density (stocking rate) and weather conditions potentially affecting the weight, and hence, the value of lambs. Because empirical evidence suggests that climate changes, e.g., increased temperature, have contrasting effects on lamb weights depending on the location of the farm, the spatial effects of such changes are analyzed.

Densities of efficiency scores of CAHs and prospectively paid rural hospitals are estimated and compared using a nonparametric kernel density estimator and a bootstrap-based test. In the second stage, efficiency scores are regressed on environmental variables using bootstrapped truncated regressions. Density analysis and results from bootstrapped truncated regressions show that CAHs are less cost and allocatively efficient compared to prospectively paid rural hospitals, without being less technically efficient. Relative to their pre-conversion selves, CAHs appear to be slightly less allocatively efficient, while they are slightly more technically efficient and no less cost efficient. Overall, our results suggest that the CAH Program may have decreased the allocative and cost efficiencies of those rural hospitals that converted to CAH status relative to prospectively paid rural hospitals, without significantly increasing their technical efficiency.

This article analyses coevolutionaly changes in Spanish livestock over the last 50 years, from the so-called traditional livestock model, in which ecological, social and economic elements co-evolve in closely interconnected relationships, to the currently dominant industrial livestock model, governed by ecologies at a distance. Not only meat consumption grew significantly as a consequence of the change in the prevailing livestock production model, Spain also became one of the most important meat producers in the European Union. Simultaneously, dependence on imported cereals and soya increased dramatically. Nevertheless, in spite of the prevalence of industrial logics, extensive livestock farming, that follows hybrid logics incorporating features from both models, still exists in Spain and, particularly, in Andalusia (Southern Spain). This locally based model is characterised by higher environmental standards, as well as its contribution to the preservation of a singular agro-ecosystem (dehesa). However, its long-term transformation and, therefore, the social construction of more sustainable local livestock systems, must be understood as a co-evolutionary process in which agency and social selection of innovations are essential elements.

It applies the recently developed concept of 'real inequality' to a case study of sixteenth-and seventeenth-century 's-Hertogenbosch in the Southern Netherlands and demonstrates, by incorporating relative price movements, that specific (and in this case stagnant) nominal income inequality trajectories may disguise underlying shifts in real inequality that are influenced by socially biased relative prices. The analysis is then extended to include changes in demography and household size, which reveals a second important limitation in the study of long-term economic inequality. In contrast to the stagnation and eventual decline in nominal inequality seen in 's-Hertogenbosch during the long sixteenth century (1500-1650), this broadened concept of 'augmented' real inequality in fact suggests the occurrence of a significant upturn during the first half of the sixteenth century. Furthermore, while nominal inequality had decreased, real inequality appears to have been higher by the middle of the seventeenth century than it had been around 1500. The study of global and/or long-term inequality, in particular, would benefit greatly from a proper social, economic, and historical contextualization of these trends, not least in terms of the social biases in relative prices and household composition.","Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Hanus, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Antwerp, Belgium.",,"Hanus, Jord/N-3806-2019","Hanus, Jord/0000-0002-0905-9864",,,,,89,20,20,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This study finds that the developmental process of the Kiryu district from 1895 to 1930 can be divided into at least two phases, that is, one of gradual growth based on an inter-firm division of labour using hand looms and one of dynamic development based on the factory system using power looms. Weaving manufacturers-cum-contractors pioneered gradual growth by sub-contracting with rural village out-weavers and with a number of specialized, supporting firms in Kiryu town, and grew faster than factory production systems. New joint-stock firms played the role of genuine entrepreneurs by introducing power looms, thereby realizing significant economies of scale. During this new phase, the weaving manufacturers-cum-contractors survived and also introduced new production systems.","[Hashino, Tomoko] Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Otsuka, Keijiro] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan",Kobe University; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Hashino, T (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",,"Thomas, Nicola/C-6206-2015",,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243055, 25101002, 22243022] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,53,10,10,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We apply binary and ordered probit models in a two stage regression procedure to cross-sectional data collected through a household survey among randomly selected smallholder farmers. Smallholder farming systems in the research area are associated with practices that render farmlands susceptible to soil erosion causing negative impacts on land and the environment. Therefore, strategies that encourage soil conservation are likely to also offer solutions for dealing with agri-environmental challenges and poverty alleviation. Results indicate that social capital facilitates participation in collective action initiatives which then influence individual soil conservation efforts. Neighborhood social influences, subjective norms, gender, education level, farm size, access to credit and livestock ownership also emerge as key determinants of soil conservation effort. Policy implications drawn by this study encourage strategies to increase participation and effectiveness in collective action initiatives as a boost to soil conservation. Implementation of soil conservation practices could also be encouraged through awareness increasing instruments, facilitating access to agricultural micro-credit and paying attention to gender related challenges on knowledge access and rights over land and other natural resources.

In contrast, male slaves did not experience a comparable decrease in heights. To explain this puzzle within a puzzle, we show that the benefit of the marginal nutrient exceeded the cost throughout the antebellum era. As a result, it paid for slave owners to engage in the supplemental feeding of slaves, which increased their stature. While this is consistent with a productivity explanation of increased stature, we also argue that informational asymmetries played an important role in the market for slaves. Slave owners had an incentive to signal that their slaves were high-productivity laborers by supplying them with additional food, which positively impacted slave heights. We provide evidence that, distinct from a productivity explanation, signaling mattered in the trend of slave heights.","[Craig, Lee A.; Hammond, Robert G.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Hammond, RG (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",robert_hammond@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,61,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2013,7.0,2,,,,,189.0,206,,10.1007/s11698-012-0086-7,0.0,,,18,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,133XO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318174400004,0

We do so by studying the carbon emissions enabled by the primary inputs of products downstream along the production chain. We find that 18% of global carbon emissions are enabled abroad and that Developed Economies, Fossil Fuel Exporters and Asia account for 80% of the downstream emissions enabled by international trade. Both Developed Economies and Fossil Fuel Exporters exhibit a positive trade balance of enabled emissions while for Asia the opposite is true. Developed Economies and Fossil Fuel Exporters enable emissions mainly through the export of manufactured products (690 Mt) and fossil fuels (684 Mt), respectively, while Asia exhibits an outflow of enabled emissions through the import of fossil fuels (209 Mt). The measurement of enabled emissions allows the understanding of how a region's income is derived from carbon emissions occurring abroad. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We employ the total assets as a threshold variable, which is typically considered as a proxy for bank's size in the banking literature. We modify the threshold effects model to allow for time-varying effects, wherein these are modeled by a time polynomial of degree two as in Cornwell et al. (J Econom 46:185-200, 1990) model. Threshold effects estimation allows us to sort banks into discrete groups based on their size in a structural and consistent manner. We determine seven such distinct technology-groups within which banks are allowed to share the same technology parameters. We provide estimates of individual and group efficiency scores, as well as of those of returns to scale and measures of technological change for each group. The presence of the threshold(s) is tested via bootstrap procedure outlined in Hansen (Econometrica 64:413-430, 1999) and the relationship between bank size and efficiency ratios is investigated.","Ernst & Young LLP, Int Tax Serv, Transfer Pricing, Toronto, ON M5K 1J7, Canada",,"Almanidis, P (通讯作者)，Ernst & Young LLP, Int Tax Serv, Transfer Pricing, Ernst & Young Tower,222 Bay St,POB 251, Toronto, ON M5K 1J7, Canada.",pavlos.almanidis@ca.ey.com,,,,,,,49,11,11,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Hierarchal regression is used to meaure the effect of a composite shopping experience index on overall satisfaction, after controlling for basic economic factors of food shopping such as product quality, assortment, availability, and prices. Findings - There was support for three hypotheses, suggesting that: food shopping experience effects overall consumer satisfaction for grocery retailers; shopping experience varies across different grocery retail settings; and the effect of food shopping experience on consumer satisfaction varies across grocery retail settings. Research limitations/implications - Data report a single point in time and aggregate measures.

Design/methodology/approach - This study is a part of the project Community Health Management to Enhance Behaviour (CHANCE), (Lifelong Learning Programme of European Union 2007-2009). A certain vulnerable group, i.e. older people, were addressed. The study population was recruited by convenience sample. A questionnaire was used to collect data among citizens in a selected city district (n = 251). The elderly (71-80 +; n = 123) were interviewed face to face, while the younger (21-70 years; n = 128) filled in their data on their own. Findings - One third of the respondents usually measure the temperature in their refrigerator. However, one third revealed knowledge gaps relating to storage temperature for certain food items. Thirty nine per cent changes dishcloths once a week. Twenty per cent of the elderly usually put raw minced meat into their mouth to taste the seasoning without reflecting on pathogenic bacteria. There was no significant relation between the fear of food poisoning and tasting minced meat, changing the dishcloth often, or cooling down food properly. These results can be interpreted as a sign of knowledge gaps, indicating a need for improved health communication. Research limitations/implications - The study population consisted of consumers in a selected city district in Uppsala municipality. Therefore the results should not be generalized for Swedes in general. Practical implications - The collected data and the information of knowledge gaps have been used to perform a local health intervention. The results would reveal relevance for a larger nationwide survey that aims to identify knowledge gaps in terms of food handling and hygiene among Swedish citizens. Social implications - Data from the present study would be useful in the attempt to implement simple tools at the local level, in order to promote healthy habits among consumers. Originality/value - An innovative principle in the EU project CHANCE is to work from the inside out. Studies of consumers' food handling in private homes are lacking in Sweden. The present study is rather unique as it explores private households in terms of food handling and hygiene.","[Marklinder, Ingela; Magnusson, Maria; Nydahl, Margaretha] Uppsala Univ, Dept Food Nutr & Dietet, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Marklinder, I (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Food Nutr & Dietet, Uppsala, Sweden.",Ingela.Marklinder@ikv.uu.se,,,European Union [134240-LLP-1-2007-1-DE-GRUNTVIGT-GMP],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors wish to acknowledge financial support for this research from the Lifelong Learning Programme of European Union, European Commission, CHANCE project no. 134240-LLP-1-2007-1-DE-GRUNTVIGT-GMP.

Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional data were collected through a consumer survey (n = 3,213), conducted in June 2008 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the UK. Items measured were self-reported consumption frequencies, consumer perceptions of different fish product categories, and perceived barriers for increased fish consumption levels. Country specificities are discussed. Findings - The overriding healthy perception consumers have about fish was confirmed, and contributed very strongly to the general perception consumers have about fish. Fresh fish was perceived the most healthy fish product, followed by frozen, preserved and ready-meal fish products. Perception scores were highest correlated with self-reported fish consumption in the Mediterranean countries. With the exception of Romania, perceived barriers only poorly explained self-reported consumption frequencies of the different fish product categories. This finding is related to the possible influence of habit and tradition with regard to eating fish, to the absence of measures related to motivations or drivers to consume fish, or to the possibility that some of the perceived barriers reinforce each other. In the Mediterranean countries, fish consumption frequency is on a very high level, independently of perceived barriers and motivational aspects, and part of the traditional Mediterranean diet. Originality/value - The strength of this study pertains to its international scope and geographical spread. Further, consumer perceptions and perceived barriers in relation to fresh, frozen, preserved and ready-meal fish products have rarely been studied in parallel. Findings are relevant to support efforts on national and international level to stimulate or modify fish consumption, and to explore opportunities to trade fish products.","[Vanhonacker, Filiep; Pieniak, Zuzanna; Verbeke, Wim] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Vanhonacker, F (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Filiep.Vanhonacker@ugent.be,"Pieniak, Zuzanna/AAH-2058-2020; Pieniak, Zuzanna/I-7527-2013; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104",European Commission DG MARE; DG MARE,European Commission DG MARE; DG MARE,"This study is extended from the project Enquete d'image sur la perception des produits de la peche et de l'aquaculture - Etude 1 dans le cadre du contrat Lot 3 - Etudes relatives a la mise en oeuvre du FEP (Fonds Europeen pour la Peche) funded by the European Commission DG MARE, in which Ghent University acted as a subcontractor to Eurofish International Organisation.

However, the inclusion of diverse viewpoints requires the compression of complex issues, a process that is controversial. Ensuring the quality of the compression process is a major challenge, especially with regards to retaining the essential elements of the various perspectives. Based on the lessons learned during a case study that assessed sustainable management options for the Urdaibai Estuary (Basque Country-Southern Europe), we propose a process in which the explicit elicitation of weights (the prioritisation of criteria) within a participatory multi-criteria evaluation serves as a quality assurance mechanism to check the robustness of the evaluation process. The results demonstrate that diverse individual priorities can be grouped in a reduced set of social preferences by means of cluster analysis reinforced with a deliberative appraisal among a wide variety of social actors. The approach presented retains relevant information regarding extreme and sometimes irreconcilable positions, allows an explicit social sensitivity analysis of the MCE process, and enables participants to learn from and reflect upon diverse social preferences without forcing their consensus.

An allocation of the mitigation effort among multiple agents requires understanding which agent is responsible for what emissions, according to a defined measure of carbon responsibility.

However, other types of responsibility have been discussed in the literature, namely consumption-based (or upstream) responsibility and downstream responsibility. In this paper we study the latter, which is little explored in the literature.

To address this econometric problem, this paper presents a more general specification of the gravity model, which allows for (bilateral) parameter heterogeneity across individual migration pathsalong with (unilateral) origin- and destination-specific effects. The resultant three-way fixed-effects (3FE) model is applied for an analysis of interstate migration in Mexico based on cross-sectional data. To overcome parameter-dimensionality problems (due to limited or incomplete information), the 3FE model is estimated using the Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME) estimator. The empirical implications of this new modeling strategy are illustrated by contrasting the 3FE-GME estimates with those for the traditional and two-way fixed-effects (2FE) models. The former are far more plausible and intuitively interpretable than their traditional and 2FE counterparts, with parameter estimates changing in expected directions. The (average) effect of the migrant stock is markedly smaller than usually estimated, providing a more realistic measure of network-induced migration. Migration outflows from centrally located origins have significantly steeper distance decay. Path-specific distance effects exhibit directional asymmetries and spatial similarities.","Hasselt Univ, KIZOK Res Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Fac Business Econ, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium",Hasselt University,"Peeters, L (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, KIZOK Res Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Fac Business Econ, Agoralaan,Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.",ludo.peeters@uhasselt.be,,,,,,,89,19,22,2,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Szreter's conclusion made the book immediately influential, and it remains so. This finding matters a great deal for debates about the causes of the European fertility decline of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For decades scholars have argued whether the main forces at work were ideational or social and economic. This note reports a simple graphical and statistical re-analysis of Szreter's own data. We show that social class does explain cross- sectional differences in English marital fertility in 1911.","[Barnes, Geoffrey A.; Guinnane, Timothy W.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Barnes, GA (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,14,15,15,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Based on published data for Austria. Hungary, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain and the UK, this paper investigates long-term trends in aboveground HANPP and discusses the relations between population, economic growth, changes in biomass use and land-use intensity and their influences on national HANPP trajectories. During early stages of industrialization, population growth and increasing demand for biomass drive land-cover change, often resulting in deforestation, which raises HANPP. During later stages, industrialization of agriculture boosts agricultural yields often faster than biomass demand grows, resulting in stable or even declining HANPP. Technological change improves agricultural area-efficiency (biomass provision per unit area), thereby decoupling population and economic growth from HANPP. However, these efficiency gains require large inputs of fossil fuels and agrochemicals resulting in pressures on ecosystems and emissions. Our findings corroborate the argument that HANPP alone cannot - as sometimes suggested - be used as a simple measure of carrying capacity. Nevertheless, analyses of long-term HANPP trajectories in combination with accounts of material and energy flows can provide important insights into the sustainability of land use, thereby helping to understand limits to growth.

We use the non-linear threshold cointegration and error correction methodology and a long dataset beginning in 1830, in an application to the United Kingdom. There is significant evidence that, not only does the 'inverse-U' shape hold between per capita CO2 and SO2 emissions and GDP per capita, but we also find that temporary disequilibrium from the long-run EKC is corrected in an asymmetric fashion. This may be due to the historical pressure of environmental regulation in the UK to reduce emissions that are higher than permitted. However further analysis suggests that technological change can partially account for the asymmetric adjustment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Arguments from philosophy of science applied to the concept of resilience,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Vagueness; Philosophy of science; Precision; Resilience thinking,ADAPTABILITY,"Is conceptual vagueness an asset or a liability? By weighing arguments from philosophy of science and applying them to the concept of resilience. I address this question. I first sketch the wide spectrum of resilience concepts that ranges from concise concepts to the vague perspective of resilience thinking. Subsequently, I set out the methodological arguments in favor and against conceptual vagueness. While traditional philosophy of science emphasizes precision and conceptual clarity as precondition for empirical science, alternative views highlight vagueness as fuel for creative and pragmatic problem-solving. Reviewing this discussion, I argue that a trade-off between vagueness and precision exists, which is to be solved differently depending on the research context. In some contexts research benefits from conceptual vagueness while in others it depends on precision. Assessing the specific example of resilience thinking in detail, I propose a restructuring of the conceptual framework which explicitly distinguishes descriptive, evaluative and transformative aspects.

It assesses downstream users' willingness to pay (WTP) for improved tap water quality in a setting where upstream landowners are clearing watersheds. The research findings are indicative of a considerable WTP for improved drinking water services and a definite local awareness of upstream-downstream interdependencies, suggesting potential for successful PES. Contingent Valuation (CV), however, found a substantially lower WTP under a PES scenario than under an alternative scenario involving infrastructure investments. The qualitative research angle indicates that the feasibility of a locally-financed PES system may have been negatively affected by the prevailing discursive framing of agricultural externalities and entitlements, raising issues about the fairness of such payments. Moreover, low levels of mutual trust were found to undermine the credibility of the PES framework. These results confirm that institutional failures contribute to environmental degradation and that PES should not be viewed as a market panacea transcending the local institutional context, but rather as a potentially complementary instrument within a broader rearrangement of environmental governance.

However, it is an understated and neglected aspect of guild activities. This article looks at welfare provision by guilds, with the aim of addressing four questions. Firstly, for which risks did guild welfare arrangements exist in the Netherlands between 1550 and 1800, and what were the coverage, contributions, benefit levels, and conditions Secondly, can guild welfare arrangements be regarded as insurance Thirdly, to what extent and how did guilds overcome classic insurance problems such as adverse selection, moral hazards, and correlated risks Finally, what was the position of guild provision in the Dutch political economy and vis-a-vis poor relief?","Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Van Leeuwen, MHD (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"van Leeuwen, Marco H.D./F-3466-2013",,,,,,108,34,37,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The economics of trophy hunting is analyzed with the Scandinavian moose (Alces alces) serving as an example. A four-stage model (calf, yearlings, adult female and adult male) is formulated. The calves, yearlings, and females are hunted for meat, while the males are hunted for trophies and where the demand for trophy hunting depends on price and quality. We find that trophy hunting boosts the male population and yields a high ratio of males to females. The main reason for this result is that we consider a management scheme with well defined property rights and not of the 'open-access' type, and where the key mechanism is the quality demand effect in trophy hunting. In an extended model where ecological theory of animal adoption to hunting is assumed to influence the biology through fertility we still find that trophy hunting boosts the male stock.

The primary purpose of this study is to explore the factors that are important for the selection of restaurants and also to identify the cultural or regional differences in consumer behaviours amongst student customers in relation to international fast food restaurants. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 447 questionnaires were randomly distributed among university students of three cities. Data analysis was done in SPSS Version 17. Important factors were identified by factor analysis and ANOVA was used to measure the differences (among cities). Findings - According to the findings, customers considered price, variety of food, promotional deals and timely service as the important factors for the selection of fast food restaurants. Different factors were found in different cities. This implies that the choice and selection criteria of customers from different cities in the same country for fast food restaurants may vary. Research limitations/implications - The results of this study should only be generalised to the fast food sector as the research only explored the fast food industry. The respondents were selected only from university students of three cities in Pakistan. Other customer segments and geographical areas should be included in future studies. Practical implications - The results enable marketers to focus on key points in formulating different strategies, like designing the pricing strategy, the service blueprint, the menu, and positioning and promotional strategies, so that they can provide memorable experiences to customers. The findings also suggest that while operating in multicultural countries, customers need to observe closely. Also, adaptation to local cultures should not be limited to the national level; it should also be tailored to the regional level (cities). Originality/value - This paper puts forward the selection criteria for fast food restaurants in a large and ethnically diverse country like Pakistan. The paper also provides useful information for both academicians and marketers about new and emerging areas in how consumer choices vary in culturally diverse nations.","Asian Soc Management & Mkt Res, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Ehsan, U (通讯作者)，Asian Soc Management & Mkt Res, Islamabad, Pakistan.",com2usman@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,17,21,2,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

While the linear trend is far more popular in econometric applications, a nonlinear modeling of the trend allows a more subtle information extraction from real data, especially if the linearity of the trend cannot be expected and verified by hypothesis testing. We exploit the exact unconditional approach to propose alternative versions of some trend tests. One of them is the test of relaxed trend (Liu, 1998), who proposed a generalization of the classical Cochran-Armitage test of linear trend. A numerical example on real data reveals the advantages of the test of relaxed trend compared to the classical test of linear trend. Further, we propose an exact unconditional test also for modeling association between an ordinal response and nominal regressor. Further, we propose a robust estimator of parameters in the logistic regression model, which is based on implicit weighting of individual observations. We assess the breakdown point of the newly proposed robust estimator.","[Kalina, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Comp Sci, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences,,kalina@cs.cas.cz,"Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,519.0,529,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500048,0

The paper also presents the motivations and challenges for hospitality practitioners in developing and maintaining direct relationships with primary suppliers. Design/methodology/apProach - In order to enable the collection of information about both behaviour and attitudes in regard to direct supply relationships, a multi-stage survey approach is used. This involves a questionnaire followed by a structured focus group; this dual approach seeks to provide opportunity for a richer dataset and also enables some triangulation of data so as to optimise the validity and reliability of the study. Findings - The paper gives an initial picture of the level and types of supply relationships in the hospitality sector and makes clear that there is scope for a more strategic approach to supply chain management across the sector. The evidence from this study gives support to the assertion that there are strong social, economic, organisational and market rationales for a more concerted effort to promote higher levels of direct supply chain relationships in the hospitality sector. Research limitations/implications - The study is exploratory in nature and uses a relatively small sample to identify the benefits and challenges. Practical implications - The study aims to provide guidance and recommendations for industry stakeholders as to the benefits of direct supply relationships.

This article attempts to find an answer to the question whether the minimum wage in the Czech Republic is set at a level that motivates people to seek work. This paper describes the development of the gross minimum wage in the Czech Republic in the years 1991 - 2012. After taxes on personal income and after considering other deductible items the net minimum wage is derived. The paper also describes the development of the living minimum in the Czech Republic. The living minimum reflects a change in its structure since 2007. A separate contribution for housing was introduced. By comparing the net minimum wage and the living minimum this paper examines whether particularly low-skilled people are motivated to look for work and not to rely on social benefits in the Czech Republic. It shows that there were years during which it was better not to work and to live on social benefits in the Czech Republic.

By making modern health care more accessible and affordable, policymakers hope that more women will seek prenatal care and thereby improve health outcomes. This paper studies how Ghana's social health insurance program affects prenatal care use and out-of-pocket expenditures, using the two-part model to model prenatal care expenditures. We test whether Ghana's social health insurance improved prenatal care use, reduced out-of-pocket expenditures, and increased the number of prenatal care visits. District-level differences in the timing of implementation provide exogenous variation in access to health insurance, and therefore strong identification. Those with access to social health insurance have a higher probability of receiving care, a higher number of prenatal care visits, and lower out-of-pocket expenditures conditional on spending on care.","[Abrokwah, Stephen O.] Swiss Reinsurance Amer Holding Corp, 175 King St, Armonk, NY 10504 USA; [Moser, Christine M.] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ & Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] NBER, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Western Michigan University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Abrokwah, SO (通讯作者)，Swiss Reinsurance Amer Holding Corp, 175 King St, Armonk, NY 10504 USA.",stephen_abrokwah@swissre.com; christine.moser@wmich.edu; ecnorton@umich.edu,", Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631",,,,,26,17,18,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Indeed, in the short run, changes in social capital predict a much smaller portion of the changes in subjective well-being than over longer periods.

Findings reveal physicians are highly responsive to fee generosity under both programs. Also, their willingness to accept patients under either program is affected by the generosity of fees under the other program, i.e., there are significant spillover effects between Medicare and Medicare fee generosity. We also simulate how physicians in 2008 would have likely responded to Medicaid and Medicare payment reforms similar to those embodied in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, had they been permanently in place in 2008. Our findings suggest that Medicaid Parity for primary care physicians would have likely dramatically improved physician willingness to accept new Medicaid patients while only slightly reducing their willingness to accept new Medicare patients. Also, many more primary care physicians would have been willing to treat dually enrolled patients.","[Brunt, Christopher S.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Jensen, Gail A.] Wayne State Univ, Inst Gerontol, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Jensen, Gail A.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; Wayne State University; Wayne State University,"Brunt, CS (通讯作者)，Georgia So Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",cbrunt@georgiasouthern.edu; gail.jensen@wayne.edu,,"Brunt, Christopher/0000-0003-4760-6707",,,,,19,16,19,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

In line with the recent literature on the gravity model of trade, the paper presents a battery of estimation methods. The analysis shows that bilateral VWT flows are affected by the classical determinants of trade, by national water endowments, and by the level of pressure on water resources. These general findings are robust, even though some variation can be observed across the estimation methods and, in particular, when smaller sub-samples of countries (such as continents and regional groups) are considered. This contributes to account for the mixed evidence in the literature on the importance of water endowments for the VWT flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main contribution of this article is to investigate how different combinations of flexible and stringent mechanisms create the incentives and constraints to shape market selection and innovation. The model outcomes stress that (1) stringency is the most determining feature of policy design (timing is also decisive but it appears to be of secondary importance); (2) technology substitution that brings radical technological change and significant pollution reduction is possible only if regulation is stringent enough but after many sacrifices, especially in terms of market concentration and number of failures; and (3) soft regulation does not lead to technology transition because of weak incentive and selection effects.

This article compares the PBs and GCR paradigms and integrates them into a unified PBs-GCR conceptual framework, which we call Boundary Risk for Humanity and Nature (BRIHN). PBs emphasizes global environmental threats, whereas GCR emphasizes threats to human civilization. Both paradigms rate their global threats as top priorities for humanity but lack precision on key aspects of the impacts of the threats. Our integrated BRIHN framework combines elements from both paradigms' treatments of uncertainty and impacts. The BRIHN framework offers PBs a means of handling human impacts and offers GCR a theoretically precise definition of global catastrophe. The BRIHN framework also offers a concise stage for telling a stylized version of the story of humanity and nature co-evolving from the distant past to the present to multiple possible futures. The BRIHN framework is illustrated using the case of disruptions to the global phosphorus biogeochemical cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Even if they are often disconnected from an organizational standpoint, glocal manifestations of resistance have emerged since the 1990s. Today, environmental movements assert common values related to place, identity, and culture. Activists' concepts such as ecological debt, environmental justice, environmental liabilities, land grabbing, environmental gentrification, corporate accountability, climate justice, food sovereignty, or economic degrowth are the keywords of the networks of the global Environmental justice movement. At the same time, such concepts support the rural and urban movements that remake place for marginalized groups, re-assert traditional practices, and protect territory from contamination, land appropriation, and real estate speculation. Some possibilities exist for cooperation between Environmental justice and the other varieties of environmentalism.

J,"Abreu, MD",,,,"Abreu, Marcelo de Paiva",,,"A 'blank cheque'? Portuguese Second World War sterling balances, 1940-73",ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The British effort in the Second World War required massive external financing which depended on Lend-Lease and the accumulation of sterling balances. Indebtedness in sterling balances corresponded to almost 38 per cent of this total at the end of the war. Portuguese sterling balances, although a small share of the total, were important because of pre-emptive purchases, especially of wolfram, and because of the 'gold clause' which was to be applied to outstanding balances. Portugal's willingness to finance British purchases contrasts with the requirement of German payments in goods or cash for their purchases in Portugal. The settlement of Portuguese sterling balances in August 1945 was singular as it preceded the Anglo-American settlement of December 1945 which had important consequences for sterling balance holders, as the US insisted that the US$3.75 billion loan should not be used to settle British war debts. Postwar settlement of British debt through a long-term loan from Portugal to Britain contrasts with settlements that involved the sale of British assets. Salazar's concerns about the postwar international position of Portugal, the Portuguese Empire, and the survival of the Portuguese regime are relevant in explaining his pro-British stance during and after the war.","[Abreu, Marcelo de Paiva] Pontif Cathol Univ Rio JaneiroEcon, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Abreu, MD (通讯作者)，Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,"Abreu, Marcelo/0000-0002-9693-7134",,,,,46,4,4,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

During the latter nineteenth century, the officer corps was highly specialized, split between groups of line and staff officers. Developments in general purpose technologies created a dilemma for the organization, as it balanced between the benefits of a specialized workforce implementing increasingly complex technologies with rising communication and coordination costs. We first document the nature and extent of labor specialization in the mid-nineteenth-century Navy-engineers worked more with newer and larger vessels, while line officers worked more with unskilled personnel. The Navy endeavored to destroy this distinction, forcing generalized training and tasks for all officers. We suggest that the Navy's phased-in approach was an effective strategy, helping the U.S. to become a world-class naval power.","[Glaser, Darrell J.; Rahman, Ahmed S.] US Naval Acad, Dept Econ, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy,"Rahman, AS (通讯作者)，US Naval Acad, Dept Econ, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA.",dglaser@usna.edu; rahman@usna.edu,,,,,,,36,4,5,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2014,8.0,2,,,,,173.0,200,,10.1007/s11698-013-0098-y,0.0,,,28,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AF4LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000334683500002,0

Following its concept of flood protection, a state authority felled thousands of trees in a highly popular nature protection area, which culminated in public protests and lawsuits. In analysing this conflict, we pursue a twofold aim: (1) to better understand the conflict at hand, and (2) to explore the advantages and limitations of using the capability approach for addressing an environmental conflict involving collective actors. We use qualitative research methods to examine the case, relying upon semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders as well as a document analysis. The freedom-agency lens of the capability approach proves helpful in analysing the actors' positions and interplay in the conflict. However, its limitations also become visible. We suggest that one should go beyond the variables included in a typical capability generation framework to understand the case better: certain variables need to be elaborated in more detail while some further variables need to be added to the framework.

Although several stochastic frontier models for panel data are available, only a few of them are normally applied in empirical research. In this article we chose a broad selection of such models based on different assumptions and specifications of heterogeneity, heteroskedasticity and technical inefficiency. We applied these models to a single dataset from Norwegian grain farmers for the period 2004-2008. We also introduced a new model that disentangles firm effects from persistent (time-invariant) and residual (time-varying) technical inefficiency. We found that efficiency results are quite sensitive to how inefficiency is modeled and interpreted. Consequently, we recommend that future empirical research should pay more attention to modeling and interpreting inefficiency as well as to the assumptions underlying each model when using panel data.","[Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, Stavanger, Norway; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.; Lien, Gudbrand] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Lien, Gudbrand] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, Lillehammer, Norway; [Hardaker, J.

This regime shift comprises several transformations, which are currently altering the technological, political and economic system structure. To build my argument, I first sketch how technological, political and economic developments reduced the resilience of the conventional fossil-nuclear energy regime and created a new RES-regime. Second, I depict recent changes in German public discourse and energy policy as the shift to the RES-regime. Third, I highlight the challenges involved with increasing the resilience of the RES-regime. In particular, sufficient resilience of the electricity transmission grid appears to be crucial for facilitating the transformation of the whole energy system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We apply a frontier-based efficiency measure, the stochastic frontier approach, to estimate fund efficiency and the benefit of diversification. The empirical results indicate that concentration strategy may not be appropriate for fund managers, and the benefit of diversification disappears or negatively affects performance when a fund holds too large a number of different stocks. Moreover, this paper examines whether market conditions moderate the relation between diversification and fund performance. The result shows that the benefit of diversification increases within low market return, high market volatility, and financial crisis, implying that the number of stocks needed to achieve a well-diversified portfolio increases under such market conditions.","[Hu, Jin-Li; Chou, Ray Yeutien] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Chang, Tzu-Pu; Chou, Ray Yeutien] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Hu, JL (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, 118 Chung Hsiao W Rd,Sec 1, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",jinlihu@mail.nctu.edu.tw,"Chou, Ray Yeutien/S-7788-2019; Hu, Jin-Li/S-6534-2019; Chou, Ray Yeutien/C-3201-2011","Hu, Jin-Li/0000-0002-7337-2935; Chang, Tzu-Pu/0000-0003-4040-5208",,,,,30,6,6,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The study is based on the socioeconomic approach concerning interrelation between social and economic aspects of reproduction. The methods are realized for the estimation of parenting stimulation policy in the largest Russian metallurgical company. The analysis of social efficiency revealed that the birth decision made by the employees was highly determined by parental labor support measures which had been realized at the enterprise. Social efficiency is also shown by positive dynamics of birth rate, decrease of perinatal mortality, number of complicated and premature births. The results of the analysis also show high economic efficiency of the realized measures. The analysis which has been carried out using socioeconomic approach showed that social activity of business in the demographic sphere is profitable.

Design/methodology/approach - The literature review in this study assesses scientific papers, studies conducted by Brazilian and international institutions, and trade news related to the evolution of the production and commercialisation of organic products. The analysis is based on theories of consumer behaviour and competitive strategies. Findings - The results provide evidence that the organic food market in Brazil was initially based on social ideology and a movement that was opposed to conventional farming; however, since 1980, the supply and demand patterns have changed. The commercialisation of organic products since the turn of the decade has expanded beyond ideological motivation and into the Brazilian agribusiness sector. The main reasons for this expansion are changes in preferences by the Brazilian consumer, a substantial number of whom have become more concerned with the nutritional value and quality of the food they eat. This study also demonstrates that in Brazil, as well as in other countries, organic products have become a market trend. Research limitations/implications - The limited research material concerning the ideological aspects of production and trading of organic products is a factor to be considered with respect to this study.

The global financial and economic crisis has highlighted the risks faced by the single currency area, if the member states react to events differently. Mundell considered the probability of asymmetric shocks as one of the downsides of the optimum currency area. This article aims to explain the characteristics of the euro zone crisis and to identify the problems that have arisen under the influence of asymmetric shocks to answer the question whether the euro zone corresponds to the optimum currency area criteria.

There is no lack of definitions currently offered, however, based on expanding, evolving, and sometimes conflicting, dimensions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate various emerging definitional elements of local foods to determine which elements may be as important to food shoppers today as the prevailing food miles definition. Design/methodology/approach - A shopper survey is fielded and repeated measures ANOVA conducted to measure the relative importance of various definitional elements, assess where shoppers expect to acquire local foods, the price premium they are willing to pay, and differences that may exist across customer groups. Findings - The study finds that consumers do consider other definitional elements as important as distance in their definition of local foods and they expect to find them in secondary outlets beyond farmers markets and the produce department. Consumers are willing to pay a price premium and there are differences across light, medium, and heavy users. Practical implications - This study provides researchers with an expanded and clearer definition of local foods for future research and practitioners with guidance on what shoppers expect and value today and how to better source, merchandise, and promote local foods. Originality/value - By combining definitional elements from across industry, government, and academia and analyzing them together, this study offers a more comprehensive definition of local foods and consumer expectations.","[Lang, Mark; Stanton, John; Qu, Yingdao] St Josephs Univ, Dept Food Mkt, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA",Saint Joseph's University,"Lang, M (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Dept Food Mkt, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",mlang@sju.edu,,,,,,,31,44,52,0,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In a conventional automatic mode of a laser depth control system, the blade height is set by the laser control box with respect to a desired plane, which is provided via a laser transmitter. During leveling, if the cutting depth becomes too high, the power needed will be higher than the tractor drawbar power, and this will lead to extra load on the engine of the tractor and a decrease in engine speed. To prevent the overload on the land-leveling machine and tractor, the driver must quickly change from auto-mode of the laser system to manual and decrease the depth of cutting simultaneously. This needs a fast and skillful response from the driver. In order to prevent overload during leveling, an extra blade depth controller was designed and fabricated in this project. The designed system consisted of a closed-loop controller, which gets the real tractor engine speed via a dynamo. This was compared to values of critical and desired speeds of the engine that were defined by the user via a manual keyboard. These data were stored in the main microcontroller memory (programmed with 130 lines of codes with AVR-Codevision software), and displayed on an LCD screen. If critical engine speed is reached and the engine is overloaded, the system disrupts the laser control and raises the blade. The fabricated system was fitted onto a land-leveling laser machine and evaluated on a farm. The fuel consumption and field performance of the land-leveling machine were determined with and without using the fabricated system in operation. The test was conducted with five replications. Results showed a significant difference at the 5% level with an 18.4% reduction in fuel consumption and 19.7% increase in field productivity.","[Masoumi, A. A.; Shafaei, S.

This paper first investigates Moran's I tests for spatial dependence in panel data models where spatial weights matrices can be time varying. Based on time varying and time invariant spatial weights matrices, the empirical size and power of Moran's I tests for spatial dependence are evaluated and compared. Monte Carlo results indicate that size of Moran's I tests based on time varying and misspecification of time invariant spatial weights matrices have not significant difference, especially compared with misspecification time invariant spatial weights matrices, power of Moran's I tests for spatial dependence with time varying spatial weights matrices is much higher. TV-Moran tests are superior to NTV-Moran tests with the misspecification of invariant spatial weights matrix, with larger power.","[Ou, Bian-Ling] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,,oubianling@amss.a.cn,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,12,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",1951-6851,,978-94-6252-008-0,ADV INTEL SYS RES,,,2014,107.0,,,,,,27.0,33,,,,,,7,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BB0ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340893200005,0

Recently, however, not only clusters are gaining importance, but mainly related variety, defined by Boschma as 'industrial sectors that are related in terms of shared or complementary competences' (2007). Related variety is a key concept of creating regional smart specialisations because of its positive impact on regional development. We claim that cluster potential identification tool can still be one of the most effective tools for identifying related variety and specialisation within it on the micro level. The literature review shows several methods, that are widely used to identify cluster potential, among them exist such as: case studies, concentration analysis and input-output methods. This papers presents new approach that may be used to find related sectors cooperating together not only between regions, but also within the region. The approach seeks for the real functioning cooperation links, not only existing sectors in given proximity. Finding these links will allow to identify related sectors that are exchanging knowledge through value chains.

We use data obtained from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey. A recursive bivariate probit model is adopted to analyze the factors affecting the awareness and the utilization of preventive care. The probability of awareness of free preventive care under the National Health Insurance is higher for those who are younger, Mainlanders, have received more education, have a spouse, exercise regularly, have better self-rated health status, and have chronic diseases; the probability of awareness is lower for those who are aborigines and who live in the south and the east. Awareness of preventive care services, having a spouse, living alone, having better health status, and the existence of chronic diseases increase the probability of preventive care utilization; working reduces the probability of preventive care utilization. Our result supports the views in Arrow (Am Econ Rev 53(5):941-973, 1963) that health information is an important factor determining the demand for medical care. Policymakers may enhance such preventive care service utilization by increasing the awareness of such services among the elderly.","[Chen, Chun-Chih] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Yen-Ju] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Finance & Taxat, Taichung 404, Taiwan; [Lin, Ying-Tzu] Chinese Culture Univ, Sch Continuing Educ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University; National Taichung University of Science & Technology; Chinese Culture University,"Lin, YJ (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Finance & Taxat, 129,Sec 3,Sanmin Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",jzchen@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; yenru@nutc.edu.tw; yingtzulin@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,12,14,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Compositional change and declining energy intensity attenuate emissions growth, but their impacts are offset by increasing population and income. Despite absolute interstate divergence in both emissions and their precursors, states' emission-and energy intensities-and ultimately, CO2-appear to be stochastically converging. We assess the implications of these trends using a novel vector autoregression (VAR) emission forecasting technique based on our index numbers. The resulting emission projections are comparable to, but generally exceed, those forecast by the 2010 EIA Annual Energy Outlook.","[Baldwin, James G.; Wing, Ian Sue] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Baldwin, JG (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 685 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jbaldwin@bu.edu; isw@bu.edu,,,,,,,50,16,19,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This study reinforces those findings for forest and species conservation across two groups of countries. Additionally, through explicit comparison with two previous EKC studies, I enable an illustration of precisely how EKC results are affected by the incorporation of consumption and highlight persistent problems with EKC analyses. Despite general linear modeling results showing that wealthy countries drive deforestation in poorer countries through the import of forest resources, EKC analyses can still indicate improvements in conservation for wealthier countries. Such contradictions suggest that recent methodological improvements to the EKC cannot guarantee the validity of evidence from EKC analyses. Poor quality of resource stocks data, the restrictive time scales that can be examined with those data, and the lack of consistent results across different groups of countries all speak to continued inadequacies of the EKC hypothesis and the need to focus on approaches that address actual behavior patterns exhibited by different income groups.

Latin America has pursued a development path based largely on exports of primary resources. Adopting this path has characteristic environmental and social impacts. In this paper, we provide the first broad based estimate of material use and material efficiency for the region, beginning in 1970 and extending to the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008. The results show a region with rapidly growing primary materials consumption, which is simultaneously becoming less efficient at converting those resources into national income. Using an IPAT framework, we found that population growth and rising per-capita incomes made comparable contributions to growing material use, while technological change as reflected in material intensity, did not moderate consumption. Increasing materials intensity, observed for the region as a whole, is also observed for most individual countries. This contrasts with some other world regions, and implies that many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean will confront higher environmental pressures than expected when expanding their extractive industries to take advantage of new demand from other world regions, while simultaneously supplying the requirements for their own domestic industrial transformations and urbanization.

It was negotiated pursuant to a mandate established by the First Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties in 2004 under an enabling provision in the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol. The Supplementary Protocol seeks to deal with damage to biodiversity as well as 'associated' traditional material or personal damage. It delineates two pathways to dealing with such damage: the administrative approach that empowers a competent authority to deal with the matter administratively, without initial recourse to courts; and a civil liability approach that requires litigants to seek private law remedies through national legal systems. However, while the Supplementary Protocol has elaborate and comprehensive provisions implementing the administrative approach, it incorporates only a single article on civil liability which does little more than exhort parties to continue to apply their existing domestic law on the subject or establish rules to deal specifically with the matter. This was not the outcome anticipated when the negotiations started. It was the expectation, primarily of developing countries then, that the prospective protocol would deal essentially with civil liability and set out substantive and procedural rules on liability and redress. This article traces how and why all this came to pass. It also analyses the provisions, and the implications, relating to the administrative approach and the single enabling article on civil liability. It deals also with the challenges in implementing the administrative approach, novel to most countries. Finally, it examines the prospect for the emergence in the future of a more elaborate international civil liability regime.","[Nijar, Gurdial Singh] Univ Malaya, Fac Law, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Nijar, Gurdial Singh] Ctr Excellence Biodivers Law, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Nijar, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Law, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",director.ceblaw@um.edu.my,,,,,,,13,10,11,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

As the largest participant in the CDM market, China shoulders the biggest proportion of market risk. Among the studies on CDM in China, few have focused upon the legal aspect of CDM, which is crucial in defending developers' interests. To fill this research gap in making the transition from policy to law, this paper claims that carbon emission right, which is the basis of trade, should be attributed as a property right in Property Law of People's Republic of China. The present study will discuss the characteristics of carbon emission, definition, and legal attribution of carbon emission right. The valid object of carbon emission right in the CDM market under Property Law should be certified emissions reductions (CERs). The usufructuary right could be specifically applied in practice to the owners' property right on CERs in China. Although experience from the CDM is not fully applicable to the development of cap and trading, the success of CDM market provides a reasonable platform to study emission right in the view of legal science.

We want to understand the impact that financial pressures can have for the uninsured in advanced economies. To do so we focus on analyzing the effect of the introduction in the US of managed care and the big rise in financial pressures that it implied. Traditionally, in the US safety net hospitals have financed their provision of unfunded care through a complex system of cross-subsidies. Our hypothesis is that financial pressures undermine the ability of a hospital to cross-subsidize and challenges their survival. We focus on the impact of price pressures and cost-controlling mechanisms imposed by managed care. We find that financial pressures imposed by managed care disproportionately affect the closure of safety net hospitals. Moreover, amongst those hospitals that remain open, in areas where managed care penetration increases the most, they react by closing the health services most commonly used by the uninsured.","[Mas, Nuria] IESE Business Sch, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Mas, Nuria] PPSRC Res Ctr, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Mas, N (通讯作者)，IESE Business Sch, Av Pearson 21, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",nmas@iese.edu,,,,,,,30,5,7,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

During the most severe episodes, banks in cities across the country would often suspend or restrict the par convertibility of their demand deposit liabilities. In diagnosing the causes of the Great Depression, Friedman and Schwartz famously regard these local initiatives as a second best solution, which in the absence of an effective lender of last resort would have prevented the rash of bank failures during the early 1930s and their dire monetary and real impacts. Recent research in macroeconomics though has raised the possibility that banks' suspension of payments might also have negative real effects albeit through changes in aggregate supply such as the financing of working capital. We would expect to observe these negative shocks during the pre-Fed era, because the decentralized, private interbank payments network was especially vulnerable to systemic disruptions such as suspensions by New York and other money center banks. Reports in national trade periodicals and local newspapers during suspension periods offer many accounts of factories closing because of the inability to obtain currency for weekly payrolls and domestic exchange to finance internal trade. We corroborate these observations with more systematic econometric evidence at the national and regional levels. Our results show that controlling for the overall contraction and bank failures, suspension periods were associated with a statistically significant and quantitatively large decline in real activity, on the order of 10-20 %.","[James, John A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [McAndrews, James] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Weiman, David F.] Barnard Coll, Dept Econ, New York, NY USA",University of Virginia; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"James, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",jaj8y@virginia.edu,,,,,,,81,13,14,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2013,7.0,2,,,,,99.0,130,,10.1007/s11698-012-0083-x,0.0,,,32,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,133XO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318174400001,0

Simply put, sustainability, and its predecessor term, sustainable development, mean different things to different people. How can we hope to achieve a shared vision when we're not certain what vision we are sharing? This is not simply a rhetorical question businesses and other organizations require measurable, manageable objectives to achieve progress in this area of endeavor. The challenge of defining sustainability has already been noted by a number of writers. The most common definition, development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs first appeared in the World Commission on Environment and Development's report, Our Common Future (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987), but there are many, many more definitions and interpretations. This note takes a different approach. Rather than seeking or proposing yet another definition of sustainability, it uses Wordle, a web-based data visualization tool, to generate a tag cloud of the common elements in over one hundred previously-published definitions. The result is a visually-appealing menage of terms providing a composite picture of the essence of sustainability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The second purpose is to examine the moderation effect of CSR importance ascribed by the consumers on the above mentioned relations. Design/methodology/approach - An experimental design consisting of three between-subjects conditions was applied and three CSR initiative conditions were selected (positive, negative CSR and no CSR information as a control condition). In this framework, three different scenarios were designed and tested under the condition of a product-harm crisis related to margarine. Findings - This study highlights that CSR has an impact on attribution of blame, brand evaluation and buying intention but not on the perceived degree of danger. CSR importance has a moderation effect on the relationship between CSR and blame attribution, brand evaluation and buying intention. Practical implications - Companies in the food industry should generate CSR strategies and should develop favourable CSR history not only because CSR has an impact on brand evaluation and buying intention in routine situations but because it is a part of crisis management and response strategy as well. Originality/value - There is lack of research directly emphasizing the role of CSR in product-harm crises, in the food industry.

Design/methodology/approach Manufacturing of the probiotic ingredient involved a proprietary technique using combination of controlled fermentation of the L. casei CRL431 cells, encapsulation in a food grade matrix and drying under controlled parameters. Findings The developed ingredient was stored at 25 C for a period of 12 months. The loss in cell viability was 1.9 log cfu g-1 after 12 months and maintained at 8.3 log cfu g-1. In vitro gastric juice and bile salts incubation revealed that the probiotic cells were better protected within the encapsulated than in the free form. The survival of the encapsulated cells was 5.0 and 2.1 log cycles higher than free cells in gastric juice and bile salt solution respectively. Fortification of probiotic bacteria did not have any negative impact on the sensory qualities of the foods mentioned above. Research limitations/implications The developed technology is only applicable for fortifying dried or intermediate moisture foods with beneficial probiotic bacteria. The water activity of the products needs to be ranged from 0.2 to 0.5. A higher moisture contained food will lead to bacterial proliferations, product spoilage and loss in storage viability of the fortified probiotic cells. Practical implications A general guideline issued by FAO/WHO states that any good effect of probiotic bacteria on human health can be obtained only if consumed at a level of 10'7 to 10'8 viable cells per day. Delivery of such a concentration of live probiotic cells is particularly challenging in the case of long shelf life foods. As shown in the results, the authors' probiotic powder is able to deliver over 100 million live cells per gram after 12 months of ambient storage. Even the foods fortified with this powder are able to deliver over 1 million cells per gram after six months of ambient storage. Social implications The developed technology rightly identified the gap for fortifying probiotic bacteria into foods stored under ambient conditions which is a real hindrance to reach out to consumers particularly in the developing countries where refrigerated supply chain and storage are not yet established in an efficient way.

Productivity growth in personal services was not stagnant by definition, as current understanding has it, but instead was unparalleled in some cases. Motion pictures' contribution to aggregate GDP and TFP growth was much smaller than that of general purpose technologies steam, railways, and electricity, but not insignificant. An observer might have noted that motion pictures are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.

The paper finds that firm efficiency, as estimated using stochastic frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis, is negatively related to state ownership while positively related to public and employee share ownership. In addition, the relationship between ownership concentration and firm efficiency is U-shaped, indicating that the largest shareholder may engage in tunneling activities. As the identity of the largest shareholder changes from government, government-controlled legal entity to other types of legal entity, firm efficiency significantly improves. These results provide strong evidence that political interferences have reduced firm efficiency. Moreover, firms with more independent board are more efficient, supporting the argument that board of directors can be an effective internal governance mechanism. Furthermore, provincial market development, a proxy for the strength of external governance mechanism, is positively related to firm efficiency. Overall, the findings illustrate that restructuring state-owned enterprises via improvements in corporate governance has enhanced firm efficiency, but partial privatization without transfer of ownership and control from the state to the public remains a major source of inefficiency in corporate China.","[Su, Dongwei; He, Xingxing] Jinan Univ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Su, DW (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",tdsu@jnu.edu.cn; tschen@jnu.edu.cn,"Su, Larry/AAH-8426-2021","Su, Dongwei/0000-0002-6306-1850",,,,,69,36,38,3,115,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The paper presents a cost-minimisation model for nutrient abatement measures for the River Elbe. The model is applied to estimate the shadow price of phosphate and nitrogen nutrient retention services by restored floodplains. It is shown that the shadow price of restored floodplain area is a function of the nutrient load reduction target for the river basin. The scope of the floodplain restoration projects is shown to have a lesser impact on the estimated shadow price. In addition, this paper presents an empirical cost function for the costs of floodplain restoration measures in the Elbe Basin. In conjunction with the shadow prices, this allows for a rapid strategic assessment of the costs and benefits of 45 potential restoration sites along the Elbe trajectory. In spite of the large investment costs for dike realignments, the nutrient retention effects alone may in many cases generate sufficient benefits to generate an economic efficiency gain. Floodplain restoration may therefore, under advantageous circumstances, constitute a cost effective nutrient abatement measure. However the key thrust of the argument is that floodplain restoration projects have to be assessed as multifunctional projects, with the positive impacts on water quality being one of several benefit dimensions.

Estimation accounts for potential biases due to the endogeneity of density and industrial composition effects. Using new information on output per worker for U.S. metropolitan areas along with a measure of density that accounts for the spatial distribution of population, we find that a doubling of density increases productivity by 24 percent. Consistent with theories of learning and knowledge spillovers in cities, we demonstrate that the elasticity of average labor productivity with respect to density increases with human capital. Metropolitan areas with a human capital stock one standard deviation below the mean realize no productivity gain, while doubling density in metropolitan areas with a human capital stock one standard deviation above the mean yields productivity benefits that are about twice the average.

The results are linked to newly available evidence for regional value added in order to begin to form an explanatory hypothesis of long-term regional inequality in Italy: convergence in value added per capita is tested in light of the neoclassical exogenous growth approach, which incorporates human capital and social capital as conditioning variables into a long-term production function. In contrast with conventional wisdom (e.g. Putnam 1993), we find that social capital was not a significant predictor of economic growth in post-Unification Italy: It grew in importance only in the last decades. Conversely, human capital was more important in the first half of the twentieth century. Results suggest that there was not one single conditioning variable over the long run, thus supporting the view that, in different periods, conditioning variables can be determined by technological regimes.","Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Felice, E (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",ClaudioEmanuele.Felice@uab.cat,"Felice, Emanuele/G-9045-2013","Felice, Emanuele/0000-0002-1928-140X",,,,,92,55,56,1,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2012,6.0,3,,,,,267.0,306,,10.1007/s11698-011-0076-1,0.0,,,40,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,992IM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307768900003,0

Since production is often the core of the agricultural and environment policy analyses, we evaluate the models using criteria that reflect the objectives of policy analysis. We argue that policy production models should optimize the precision of policy response predictions, but also incorporate sufficient heterogeneity to allow policy makers to consider the distributional consequences of policies. Hence we develop a series of quantitative metrics of both precision and heterogeneity to compare model performance. Our approach consists of two steps. We first combine the method of generalized maximum entropy and data envelopment analysis and simultaneously estimate the production frontier and technical inefficiency parameters. With a set of household level data, we estimate production models at three different levels. The province-level model restricts the production technology parameters to be the same for all households. The county-level models allow production technology parameters to vary by county but restrict them to be equal across communities within the same county. The community-level models allow production technology parameters to vary by community. In the second step, we use the disaggregated information gain, percentage absolute prediction error and the Theil's U statistic to evaluate these models.","[Huang, Qiuqiong] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Howitt, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Food Secur & Environm Program, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Wood Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of California System; University of California Davis; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Huang, QQ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 249E Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",qhuang@umn.edu,"huang, qiuqiong/A-8130-2009","Huang, Qiuqiong/0000-0002-3354-5213",,,,,41,3,3,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We show that campaign inefficiency can alter the outcome of an election. Specifically, a loser would have won in six of the 57 races had he or she been efficient. We also show that incumbents are more likely to spend inefficiently than are challengers. Overall, inefficiency accounts for less than 5% of campaign funding but a loss of about 9% in votes received. We find evidence that campaign efficiency has increased since the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, known widely as the McCain-Feingold Act.","[Lewis, Herbert F.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Technol & Soc, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Sexton, Thomas R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Coll Business, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Lewis, HF (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Technol & Soc, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",Thomas.Sexton@StonyBrook.edu; Herbert.Lewis@StonyBrook.edu,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Here we explore the global governance challenge posed by planetary boundaries interactions by focusing on the role of polycentric systems and order, a theoretical field that has gained much interest in the aftermath of claims of a stagnant UN-process. In the first part we work toward a clarification of polycentric order in an international context, and develop three propositions. We then present a case study of the emergence of international polycentricity to address interacting planetary boundaries, namely the climate change, ocean acidification and loss of marine biodiversky complex. This is done through a study of the Global Partnership on Climate, Fisheries and Aquaculture (PaCFA) initiative. As the case study indicates, a range of mechanisms of polycentric order (ranging from information sharing to coordinated action and conflict resolution) operates at the international level through the interplay between individuals, international organizations and their collaboration patterns. While polycentric coordination of this type certainly holds potential, it is also vulnerable to internal tensions, unreliable external flows of funding, and negative institutional interactions.

The articles in this special section move us forward from this focus in three ways. First, they highlight the crucial role played by non-state actors in shaping water governance outcomes. Second, they show us how these actors can increase the 'room for manoeuvre' in negotiations. Third, they provide an entry point for developing process-focused approaches in transboundary water governance research. This article argues such an approach might improve our understanding of transboundary water outcomes and suggests new focus on how key actors form networks of alliances and shape decision-making landscapes at multiple governance levels and arenas. From a scholarly perspective, it brings to light the blurred boundary between state and non-state actors, as derived from a better understanding of the elusive links between actors and organisations; it unravels additional layers of complexity in the hydro-hegemony concept and bends the rigid notion of power asymmetry, towards the subtleties of power relations and interplays in transboundary decision-making processes.","[Suhardiman, Diana] SE Asia Reg Off, Int Water Management Inst, Viangchan, Laos; [Giordano, Mark] Int Water Management Inst, Headquarter, Colombo, Sri Lanka",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Suhardiman, D (通讯作者)，SE Asia Reg Off, Int Water Management Inst, Viangchan, Laos.",D.Suhardiman@cgiar.org,,"Suhardiman, Diana/0000-0001-7892-4148",,,,,35,21,22,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Such regulations may, however, jeopardize hunter satisfaction, on which game managers depend. Consequently, finding the optimal hunting intensity is not straightforward. Using data from Norwegian grouse hunting, we show that an integrated approach combining sociology and bioeconomics can give markedly different priorities than an optimization based exclusively on bioeconomics. Three grouse hunter typologies with contrasting stated preferences regarding bag size and crowding were used to account for varying hunter behavior. Omitting the social constructs from the model pushed the hunter density towards its upper limit, because the gain of selling one more permit generally superseded the loss in hunter satisfaction (expressed as willingness-to-pay). Although this strategy multiplied the overall profit, it produced a daily bag size that would be unacceptable to practically all hunters. We conclude that biosocioeconomic modeling is a valuable tool in the pursuit of sustainable game management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We found that health care has an income elasticity that qualifies it as a necessity good, which is consistent with results of the most recent studies. Furthermore, we found that health care spending is least responsive to changes in income in low-income countries and most responsive to in middle-income countries with high-income countries falling in the middle.

Fare et al. (1985) extended the index to measure efficiency in the full space of input and output quantities. Unfortunately, this index fails to satisfy not only indication and monotonicity at the boundary (of output space), but also weak monotonicity. We show, however, that a simple modification of the index corrects these flaws. To demonstrate the tractability of our proposal, we apply it to baseball batting performance, in which zero outputs occur frequently.","[Russell, R.

We calculate the apparent consumption of wood, taking into account both net imports of wood and the home harvest. We then develop some quantitative exercises that correlate wood consumption with GDP, with prices of wood and iron (as an alternative material to wood) and with other measures. The main conclusion is that, although wood had lost its economic centrality after the energy transition, wood consumption continued to grow in Britain both in absolute and relative terms, showing a positive elasticity to GDP superior to the unit. This result allows us to reach a more complete understanding of the socio-metabolic transition associated with the Industrial Revolution. Britain faced the increase in wood demand by relying almost entirely on imported wood, reinforcing the idea that the decoupling of economic growth from land use must to be handled with care, and should be observed not at the national level but on a global scale. Although British economic development was to a great extent focussed on what has been called the subterranean forests of coal, it simultaneously supported large tracts of surface foreign forest.

A risk assessment model for a Mediterranean river basin,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Water economics; Risk management; Drought management; Mediterranean river basins,,"Groundwater resources are traditionally overexploited in arid and drought-prone regions with profitable irrigated agriculture, and the depletion of this groundwater results from a combination of the physical scarcity of surface sources and the lack of effective control of use rights on the part of water authorities. This is the case in the Segura River Basin of southern Spain. As a result, drought risks and structural deficits have steadily increased over the last 50 years. The Drought Management Plan recently approved by the Segura River Basin Authority aims to enforce more stringent water supply restrictions from surface sources, but the plan does not include any explicit policy to handle illegal groundwater abstraction. By using a stochastic risk assessment model, this paper shows that the implementation of the drought plan will increase the expected irrigation deficits of surface water and can, paradoxically, lead to higher drought and aquifer depletion risks than the traditional rules that the new plan replaces.

We conducted choice experiments on wolf reintroduction in Hokkaido, Japan, in order to value the resulting mortality risk. This process involves three unique factors: the mortality risk is zero before the reintroduction, the increment of the risk caused by the reintroduction is substantially small, and the risk largely depends on citizens' individual characteristics concerning reintroduction. Because of these factors, the heterogeneity of risk preference is expected to be large. In order to examine these heterogeneous risk preferences, we use a random parameter logit model. The estimation results confirm that considerable heterogeneous risk preferences exist. Finally, the mean marginal willingness to pay to prevent the loss of one person per one billion people because of wolf reintroduction is several hundred yen. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These costs increase as conservation efforts lead to recovery of animal populations, and human population growth increases the proportion of land outside the parks used for agriculture. Financial and social costs associated with crop raiding were studied in 25 villages around Kibale National Park, Uganda. Perceptions about crop raiding were collected using focus groups and household surveys, while damage was evaluated based on physical monitoring of crop raiding incidents. The average financial loss for farmers around the park over six months was US$74 (1.5% of median household capital asset wealth) and damage was particularly high within 0.5 km of the park boundary. Households experiencing crop raiding were more prone to food insecurity, and higher rates of self-reported human and livestock diseases, while children from villages bordering the park tended to have poorer scholastic achievement. Compensation is not affordable for the wildlife authority, nor is it sustainable as crop raiding is escalating. To mitigate costs for local communities, funding has been justified for the implementation of crop raiding defenses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In literature, catastrophic expenditure is measured as out-of-pocket health expenditure that exceeds some fixed proportion of household income or household's capacity to pay. According the new measure proposed in this paper, OOP health expenditure is catastrophic if it reduces the non-health expenditure to a level where household is unable to maintain consumption of necessities. Based on this measure of catastrophic health expenditure, the paper examines determinants of catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure in India. The results show that, incidence of catastrophic OOP health expenditure increases with income, when we use the earlier measures. However, results based on the revised measure show that, the incidence of catastrophic payments goes down as income increases. Therefore, the analysis suggests that the findings are sensitive to the method used. The findings from multivariate analysis show economic and social status of Indian households are important determinants of incidence of catastrophic health expenditure. Education reduces the probability of incurring catastrophic health expenditure. Moreover, these findings are sensitive to measure of catastrophic OOP health expenditure and therefore, it is important to consider appropriate measure of catastrophic OOP health expenditure.","Narsee Monjee Inst Management Studies, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",SVKM's NMIMS (Deemed to be University),"Pal, R (通讯作者)，Narsee Monjee Inst Management Studies, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.",ramajoglekar128@gmail.com,"Pal, Rama/ABW-7942-2022","Pal, Rama/0000-0003-1850-3565",,,,,33,53,59,2,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Substitution of bioenergy for fossil energy is an intensely discussed option for mitigating CO2 emissions. This paper, by applying a global land-use model and a global energy-economy-climate model, explores how demand for cellulosic bioenergy crops will add an additional pressure on the land system in the future. In accordance with other studies, we find that CO2 emissions from land use change due to energy crop production will be an important factor in the GHG balance of bioenergy if natural forests will not be protected. But restricting land availability for biomass plantations by conserving natural forests requires additional efforts in the agricultural sector: First, our simulation results indicate that significant additional crop yield increases will be needed due to the combination of forest conservation and the cultivation of dedicated bioenergy crops. Secondly, our simulation results show that forest conservation in combination with increasing demand for dedicated bioenergy crops will lead to higher agricultural production costs of approximately 20%.

In this paper we argue that nuclear power is not a sustainable solution to energy problems. First, we explore the stock of uranium-235 and the different methods, fast breeder and MOX fuel reactors, developed by the nuclear power industry to exploit this resource. Second, we show that these fuel reactors are not feasible. Third, we show that the claim that nuclear energy can be used to reduce CO2 emissions is false: the emissions from the increased water evaporation from nuclear power generation must be accounted for. In the case of Japan, water from nuclear power plants is drained into the surrounding sea, raising the water temperature which has an adverse effect on the immediate ecosystem, as well as increasing CO2 emissions from increased water evaporation from the sea. Next, a short exercise is used to show that nuclear power is not needed to meet electricity demand in Japan. Such an exercise should be performed for any country considering the construction of additional nuclear power plants.

This paper is the first in a two-part survey of personal carbon trading (PCT), the term used here to describe proposed (sub-)national greenhouse gas emission trading schemes under which at least some emissions rights are allocated to and surrendered by individuals. After introducing the various proposed PCT schemes, the paper compares, in terms of equity, the two most-discussed PCT schemes with two alternative emission trading schemes and a carbon tax. The papers' two key findings are as follows. First, there are strong arguments that the equal per capita allocation proposed under some instruments is not completely fair. Second, the five instruments compared can be equivalent in terms of their equity. Along with equity, efficiency and effectiveness make up three key criteria for comparing environmental policy instruments. As PCT has no advantage in terms of equity, the paper concludes that any case for PCT will depend on it having advantages in terms of efficiency and/or effectiveness. Whether PCT has such advantages is explored in Part 2. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aims to analyse how consumers in five EU countries view a mandatory EU logo for organic food and to give recommendations for agrarian decision makers and market actors in the organic sector. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a comprehensive picture of consumer views. Focus group discussions were conducted with consumers in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy and the UK. A subsequent survey with 2,042 participants was carried out to quantify consumer views on key issues and analyse country differences. Finally, the results of the qualitative and quantitative study were brought together. Findings - While the introduction of a mandatory EU logo for organic food was generally welcomed in all countries, trust in he underlying production standards and the inspection system was not very pronounced (except in Italy). The authors conclude that the introduction of the new EU logo should be supported by communication campaigns to make clear what the new logo stands for and remove unfounded consumer concerns regarding the downscaling of standards and the trustworthiness of the inspection system. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, no previous studies exist on consumer views on a mandatory EU logo for organic food. The recommendations drawn from their findings can help to reach the objectives con nected with the introduction of the mandatory EU logo.","[Janssen, Meike; Hamm, Ulrich] Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Janssen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Witzenhausen, Germany.",M.Janssen@uni-kassel.de,"Hamm, Ulrich/AAI-6552-2020; Hamm, Ulrich/F-7886-2013; Janssen, Meike/AAA-5767-2022","Janssen, Meike/0000-0002-7734-9409; Hamm, Ulrich/0000-0001-7444-3451",European Community [207727],European Community,"The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments which helped to considerably improve the manuscript.

The Christian-religious purpose was replaced by a state of welfare (Justi) and then by a principle of population (Sonnenfels). With an acceptance of a work and thoughts of Adam Smith, a special subject was formed within the frame of economic teaching - a national economy. It was not based on relations of a purpose and the means but on a research of natural laws with a universal validity and a corresponding economic policy based on a principle laissez-faire, laissez-passer. The national economy changed a subject of examination to the theory exploring the laws effects conditioned by place and time (Braf). The content was formed by a teaching of the German historical school and the Austrian school. They are referring to the economic policy based on ideas of departmental socialism.

While the motivation for consuming convenience food has been investigated frequently, few studies have investigated the barriers. Design/methodology/approach - Three focus group studies, exploring consumers' ready-to-heat (RTH) meal dilemmas, were conducted in Norway. Findings - The frequency of barriers and four narratives are presented, and the results indicate that consumers face bottom-up dilemmas related to barriers like sensory perception, health, economy, and managing relationships; and/or top-down value dilemmas related to traditions, quality of life and environmental barriers when considering convenience food consumption. Research limitations/implications - This research contributes to the current body of literature, which mainly focuses on drivers of convenience demand, by elaborating on barriers and dilemmas for convenience choice. Practical implications - The findings imply how marketers should communicate with the convenience market. Marketing managers need to understand which barriers to break or what dilemmas to discuss when communicating with the RTH market.

To further elicit the varying underlying links between obesity and social conditions, a methodology of partial correlations was used to create social transects across Birmingham so the operational effects of social conditions upon poor diet could be investigated across a range of Birmingham neighbourhood types. Findings - Across Birmingham as a whole, people whose ethnic or social make-up did not fit the dominant group in their neighbourhood were more likely to be obese than those of the majority socio-ethnic group for that area. The level of qualifications was the dominant influencer on obesity and diet. Particularly, less wealthy people in the more affluent areas of Birmingham were likely to suffer financial difficulties in eating healthily. However, in less affluent areas, being in (low-paid) work actually increased the chances of being obese, as compared to being unemployed in these districts. Research limitations/implications - Changes in the pattern of retailing or changes in individual's social status over the period of this research may confound the results; however the research may be regarded as a snapshot of conditions in Birmingham in ca.2006. The areal analysis may be confounded by the MAUP problem, although as distance to shops does not emerge as a major predictor of obesity, the results are still valid. The research applies to only one city (Birmingham), although a wide range of neighbourhood types typical of other British cities are covered. Practical implications - Time limitations emerge as a significant factor in diet, especially in the less-affluent areas of Birmingham. The significance of a range of social indicators upon diet is greatly affected by the range of neighbourhood types sampled. Factors barring access to a healthy diet can vary upon very small scales, even down to the individual household. Distance to shops has an effect upon diet, but only as a moderating factor acting in conjunction with a wider range of economic and social factors. Social implications - The effects of poverty, and especially unemployment, have very different effects upon diet and obesity in poor as compared to affluent areas; and in poorer areas, time limitations upon households operate so as to worsen the diet of those in low-paid work. This implies that dietary improvement initiatives aimed at the less well off should aim for a compromise between health and convenience; otherwise such initiatives will merely widen health inequalities. Minority groups in all areas, whether a minority by ethnicity, age, or wealth, need special attention by dietary investigators. Originality/value - The use of partial correlations to elicit the different responses to socio-economic conditions as regards diet has not been applied before to a major UK city. The distance to shops for all residential areas for a major UK city has not been previously mapped.","Harper Adams Univ Coll, Business Management & Mkt Dept, Newport, Shrops, England",Harper Adams University,"Shaw, H (通讯作者)，Harper Adams Univ Coll, Business Management & Mkt Dept, Newport, Shrops, England.",hshaw@harper-adams.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,7,9,0,64,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In total, 668 people were surveyed from four types of population: fish farmers, economic and institutional stakeholders, pond users and inhabitants of villages located close to the ponds. A typology of perceptions was established using a principal component analysis associated with an ascending hierarchical ranking. It shows differentiated perceptions of the categories of ecosystem services by population type. Age and education affect these perceptions. In addition, econometric modeling (a multinomial logit model) showed the importance of regulating and supporting systems for fish fanners, stakeholders and pond users. The preferences of local residents are more evenly spread across service categories, although it may be noted that educational level tends to increase the choice of supporting and regulating services.

Analogous to Battese et al. (J Prod Anal 21:91-103, 2004), the metafrontier production function allows for calculating comparable TE measures, which can be decomposed into group specific TE measures and technology gap ratios. The proposed approach differs from Battese et al. (J Prod Anal 21:91-103, 2004) and O'Donnell et al. (Empir Econ 34:231-255, 2008) mainly in the second step, where a stochastic frontier analysis model is formulated and applied to obtain the estimates of the metafrontier, instead of relying on programming techniques. The so-derived estimators have the desirable statistical properties and enable the statistical inferences to be drawn. While the within-group variation in firms' technical efficiencies is frequently assumed to be associated with firm-specific exogenous variables, the between-group variation in technology gaps can be specified as a function of some exogenous variables to take account of group-specific environmental differences. Two empirical applications are illustrated and the results appear to support the use of our model.","[Huang, Cliff J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Huang, Tai-Hsin; Liu, Nan-Hung] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Money & Banking, Taipei, Taiwan",Vanderbilt University; National Chengchi University,"Huang, TH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Money & Banking, Taipei, Taiwan.",cliff.huang@vanderbilt.edu; thuang@nccu.edu.tw; 96352509@nccu.edu.tw,,"HUANG, TAI-HSIN/0000-0001-6518-4566",,,,,17,148,158,3,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We use publicly available agricultural production data to estimate the net inflows, stocks and outflows of nitrogen for 14 European countries in years 1961-2009. The dynamic model allows us to analyze the trends in the nitrogen stocks and flows overtime, and break down the total outflow of nitrogen into flows to water, air and soil. We argue that the nitrogen outflow, modeled as the decay of nitrogen stock, provides a more reliable and robust agri-environmental indicator than the conventional nutrient balance. Mathematically, the nutrient balance is an interval scale measure, whereas the nitrogen stock and the outflow from stock are ratio scale measures. Nitrogen efficiencies, calculated based on the nitrogen stocks, provide useful and insightful information beyond the conventional eco-efficiency measures defined from the nitrogen balances. The results of this paper can be used as input data for more comprehensive eco-efficiency or productivity analysis and for the evaluation and design of agri-environmental policies in Europe.

However, less focus is given to the realization that changes in labour input alone could also affect LP. Because this effect disappears when the short-run technology exhibits constant returns to scale, we call it the returns to scale effect. We decompose growth in LP into three contributing factors: (1) technical progress, (2) capital input growth and the (3) returns to scale effect. We propose theoretical measures for these three components and show that they coincide with the index number formulae consisting of prices and quantities of inputs and outputs. Subsequently, we apply the results of our decomposition to US industry data for 1987-2009. LP in the services sector is shown to grow much slower than that in the goods sector during the 1987-1995 productivity slowdown period. We conclude that the returns to scale effect can considerably explain the gap in LP growth between the two industry groups.","Ryukoku Univ, Dept Econ, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6128577, Japan",Ryukoku University,"Mizobuchi, H (通讯作者)，Ryukoku Univ, Dept Econ, Fushimi Ku, 67 Fukakusa Tsukamoto Cho, Kyoto 6128577, Japan.",mizobuchi@econ.ryukoku.ac.jp,"Mizobuchi, Hideyuki/KBR-3306-2024","Mizobuchi, Hideyuki/0000-0001-6893-4035",,,,,28,3,4,2,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We exploit a new survey covering 22,759 individuals from EU27 countries. Our results suggest that individual preferences matter to move beyond an orientation based on recycling, to achieve a reduction of the sources of waste.

However, this scholarship fails to adequately take into consideration that if planned de-growth actually materialised it would do so in societies that differ considerably from one another and that this would have implications both for the transition processes and the nature of their outcomes. In other words, not enough importance is ascribed to capitalist diversity and the nature of institutional change in the growth-critical literature. Against this background, the purpose of the present article is to make the concrete utopia of de-growth scholars and steady-state economists more specific by utilising insights from scholarship on capitalist diversity and institutional change. On the basis of a typology of different models of capitalism, the article suggests that if de-growth transitions took place they would take different forms and lead to a variety of types of steady-state economies (SSEs).

Establishing a sustainable bioenergy industry requires considering the role of biological control in farm decision making. An important question is how biomass supply changes when farmers take into account agricultural pest biocontrol services. A spatially-explicit bioeconomic model of potential biomass supply that incorporates the effect of biological control on crop choice is employed using data from four Wisconsin counties. The results of the study show that integrating agricultural biocontrol into farmers' production technology generally results in biomass from crop residues being supplied more readily (at a lower relative price).

With this separation come three fundamental but interrelated decision-making perspectives on the sustainability assessment of resource use. These three perspectives correspond to the three assessment questions if, how, and where resources should be used. Most sustainability assessment approaches do not make their underlying assessment perspectives explicit. The goal of this paper is to provide structure and organisation to existing approaches. This structuring suggests that any discussion on the appropriateness and validity of different assessment approaches and their results must take into account the underlying assessment perspective. The three questions if, how, and where resources should be used correspond to the requirements of a sustainable resource use. While existing assessments do address the three questions in isolation, it is all the more important that the limitations and implications of focusing on a single perspective are spelled out. As the main contribution, the paper distinguishes the rationale of each assessment perspective and develops on their interlinkages and thus provides the context and structure for a more informed and fruitful debate on the assessment of sustainable resource use.

This paper aims to understand and identify the underlying discourses that have dominated the emergence of REDD+, by identifying the key story lines in the policy and academic debates on REDD+. As such, this paper takes a step away from the fine-tuning of policy recommendations and instead studies REDD+ from a more theoretical approach with the intent to provide a critical analysis of the ideational structures that shape the policies that have emerged around REDD+. The analysis shows that ecological modernization and its accompanying story lines constitute a dominant notion of REDD+ as being able to manage the complexities of forest in a synergetic way, combining cost-efficient and effective mitigation with sustainable development. The paper also identifies the critical counter discourse of civic environmentalism, which criticizes this notion of REDD+ and instead promotes issues such as equity, the importance of local knowledge, and the participatory process. It argues that reducing deforestation involves trade-offs between economic, ecological, and social dimensions, also arguing that REDD+ fits overwhelmingly with the interest of the global North.","Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Nielsen, TD (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",tobias.nielsen@svet.lu.se,,,,,,,53,38,40,1,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Robust accounts of biophysical resources used in the production processes of traded goods are required to support sustainable consumption and to expose problem shifting related to environmental policies. In this context, multi-region input-output analysis (MRIO) is becoming a widely applied tool to establish consumption-based accounts and to analyse production-consumption links along complex international supply chains. Using the example of China's trade in cropland products and embodied cropland, we make the case for a re-evaluation of its application to land and other resources. While analyses based on physical trade matrices show that China is a major net importer of cropland products and embodied cropland, MRIO-based results suggest exactly the opposite. We do not find convincing arguments that could explain these large differences. Based on our knowledge of land systems and biomass metabolism and on the results from physical accounting, we question the plausibility of MRIO-derived results. We conclude by outlining next steps in research that are required to improve assessments of trade-related resource use in order to produce more robust results, a prerequisite for the formulation of policy recommendations.

Although born in an economic context, IOTs are increasingly used for the environmental impact assessment of product systems, e.g. in environmental policy analysis, and for several others such as the accounting of greenhouse gases. However, the use in these contexts does not ensure the validity of the LOT as a consistent and robust multidisciplinary modeling tool in itself. It is in respect to certain basic requirements that IOTs should find their legitimacy. In this paper, we study their validity with respect to a well-established scientific law: the mass balance. Compliance with this basic balance is an important check for data consistency. Following such a track, we focus specifically on monetary input-output tables and we reach the conclusion that IOTs can fail in respecting the basic balance laws whenever prices differ per purchaser. Therefore caution is needed because the estimations in terms of environmental pressures can be biased. The drawback lays in the use of homogeneous prices, which determines a discrepancy in physical units between what is used and what is asked for, within and between activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is proven that: first, the RPI index collapses to the Malmquist productivity index when the technology is constant returns to scale (CRS); second the RPI index equals the Hicks-Moorsteen productivity index under homotheticity of technology (and non-CRS).

In spite of this wide consensus, central questions remain unanswered. Thus, while the harmful effects of dysfunctional administrations are extensively covered in the theoretical literature, little is known about the empirical relevance and the expected costs of insufficient administrative rationalization. And while efficient bureaucracies are considered a key ingredient to institutional performance, the existing research rarely investigates how desirable administrative structures have been implemented in history or which concrete policy measures constitute feasible reform strategies for present-day development countries. The present paper therefore aims at providing empirical evidence to dose this lacuna; to do so, it relies on the case of administrative reforms in the last three decades of the nineteenth century in Meiji Japan. Building on an exceptionally detailed set of official statistics and documentary sources, it constructs a panel of 45 Japanese prefectures and assesses the impact of heterogeneous reform implementation on canonical indicators of economic performance including measures of regional GDP, business activity and financial market development. The central results of the econometric analysis are that delayed administrative rationalization came along with a statistically significant and robust penalty on all development indicators. Moreover, this effect was remarkably persistent over time, as the data show that late-reforming prefectures performed systematically worse than the administrative forerunners until well into the twentieth century.","Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Muehlhoff, K (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",kmuehlho@rumms.uni-mannheim.de,,"MUHLHOFF, Katharina/0000-0001-7471-1161",,,,,62,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2014,8.0,2,,,,,201.0,239,,10.1007/s11698-013-0099-x,0.0,,,39,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AF4LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000334683500003,0

Most burden-sharing proposals for climate mitigation treat states as homogenous agents, even those that aim to protect individual rights. This can lead to free riders in some large emerging economies and expose the poor to mitigation burdens in others. Proposals that incorporate an exemption for the poor can avoid these outcomes, but do not account for the role of internal policies on the poor's actual emissions and mitigation burdens. This will create moral hazards in the design of such agreements and risk the misallocation of mitigation costs when implemented. To ensure equitable outcomes at the individual level, international agreements would need to build in additional provisions to encourage benefiting states to reduce emissions and target exemptions to the poor.

This paper aims to highlight the influence of the proximity between biomass production and energy consumption on the demand for alternative bio-fuels. In the context of Burkina Faso, we explore potential demand for Jatropha oil (Jatropha curcas) as a diesel substitute among engine owners. Survey data are based on a between-groups design: one group of respondents experiencing a local supply chain, while the other a global one. Results show that proximity has a significant effect on potential demand itself and on the formation and strength of beliefs regarding Jatropha oil. In a local supply chain context, the demand is superior and seems to be guided more by a certain economic and technical rationality. Conversely, the prospect of a Jatropha oil produced outside the village restrains demand and this latter is more determined by contextual factors and social interaction. Our analysis confirms that demand does not only depend on technical and economic factors such as price but also on the integration of the biomass production and processing in the socioeconomic life of local rural populations. Understanding demand construction and assessing underlying beliefs are key success factors for bio-energy projects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Relying on a large sample of notarised loans, the article shows that women participated in the credit market as lenders and borrowers. However, their participation was lower than that of men. In addition, women received smaller loans and paid higher interest rates than men. The evidence suggests that the lower participation of women as borrowers and their smaller loans were largely a consequence of the distribution of collateral. In addition, much of the difference in interest rates resulted from the differences in loan sizes. As women received smaller loans and there were probably fixed costs involved in granting a loan, making a loan to a woman implied a higher average cost. RESUMEN Este articulo analiza el papel de las mujeres y la discriminacion por genero en el mercado de credito hipotecario en Peru entre 1860 y 1875. Basandonos en una muestra significativa de prestamos notariales, el articulo muestra que las mujeres participaron en el mercado de credito como prestamistas y prestatarias. Sin embargo, su participacion fue menor que la de los hombres. Adicionalmente, las mujeres recibieron prestamos mas pequenos y con mayores tasas de interes que los hombres. La evidencia sugiere que la menor participacion de las mujeres como prestatarias y el menor tamano de sus prestamos se debieron en gran medida a la distribucion de colateral. Ademas, en gran medida las diferencias en tasas de interes se explican por las diferencias en tamanos de los prestamos. En la medida en que las mujeres recibieron prestamos mas pequenos y hubo probablemente costos fijos en garantizar un prestamo, prestar dinero a una mujer implico un mayor costo promedio.","CTR Catolica Grad Business Sch, Lima 33, Peru",,"Zegarra, LF (通讯作者)，CTR Catolica Grad Business Sch, Jr Daniel Alomia Robles 125-129, Lima 33, Peru.",lfzegarrab@pucp.edu.pe,,"Zegarra, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-9956-8055",,,,,54,6,9,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

A review of the literature on non-parametric dynamic efficiency models identifies five key factors of the inter-temporal dependence between input and output levels over different periods: (i) production delays; (ii) inventories (inventories of exogenous inputs or inventories of intermediate and final products); (iii) capital or generally quasi-fixed factors (and associated embodied technological change, vintage specific capital); (iv) adjustment costs; and (v) incremental improvement and learning models (disembodied technological change). This paper reviews the literature and finds that the dynamic issues associated with adjustment costs and capital have received considerable attention in the literature, whereas the dynamic issues associated with inventories have received less attention. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research such as relaxing the perfect anticipation/knowledge assumption for future variables, prices, and states. Moreover, Dynamic Network Data Envelopment Analysis has provided a unifying framework for some dynamic factors, but further development of these models is necessary including meaningful applications.","[Fallah-Fini, Saeideh; Triantis, Konstantinos] Virginia Tech, Northern Virginia Ctr, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Syst Performance Lab, Falls Church, VA 22043 USA; [Johnson, Andrew L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Fallah-Fini, S (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Northern Virginia Ctr, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Syst Performance Lab, 7054 Haycock Rd, Falls Church, VA 22043 USA.",fallah@vt.edu; triantis@vt.edu; ajohnson@tamu.edu,"Johnson, Andrew/B-7226-2012","Johnson, Andrew/0000-0003-3848-6977",,,,,74,48,50,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses actual purchasing behaviour of six consumer segments with different attitudes towards food in general, and organic production and products in particular. The data is from the Danish market for organic foods, which is one of the most mature markets in the world. Findings - The segmentation splits consumers into a positive and a non-positive half, each half consisting of three different segments. The estimations show that the development in general organic consumption varies between segments, and that their behaviour varies between sub-markets. The positive half of the population has driven the overall growth in organic budget share at the Danish market over the period 2005 to 2007, while the other half have not changed their consumption significantly. Practical implications - The results indicate that for the most dedicated organic consumers, the organic budget share may be approaching a saturation point for some types of food, but also identify other types of food which still have a growing organic budget share, even among the most dedicated consumers. Originality/value - The combination of attitudes and actual behaviour for a large number of consumers is new, and the results provide a valuable contribution to the ongoing investigation of organic consumers, and provide new nuances to the understanding of the latest organic growth.","[Andersen, Laura Morch; Lund, Thomas Boker] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Andersen, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",La@ifro.ku.dk,"Lund, Thomas/E-4584-2015; Andersen, Laura Morch/K-8279-2013","Lund, Thomas/0000-0001-5282-1562; Andersen, Laura Morch/0000-0001-8763-1670",International Centre for Research in Organic Food Systems (ICROFS),International Centre for Research in Organic Food Systems (ICROFS),"The research presented in this paper is part of the DARCOF III project The viability and stability of demand (CONCEPTS) which was funded by The International Centre for Research in Organic Food Systems (ICROFS, formerly known as Danish Agricultural Research Centre for Organic Farming, DARCOF).",,21,6,8,1,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In recent years, to solve these problems, many good alternative methods like artificial neural networks have been proposed in the literature. Although the most used artificial neural networks type is multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks, multiplicative neuron model artificial neural networks (MNM-ANNs) have been used to obtain forecasts for a few years. Many of previous studies were used to original series without any transformations such as differencing operation, Box-Cox transformations. Although stationary is an important assumption, previous studies have shown that forecasts obtained from ANNs were employed to non-stationary time series. Box-Cox transformations have been often used to time series because of heteroscedasticity. We used particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms to train MNM-ANNs, and investigated differencing effects of original and transformed data which are obtained from Box-Cox transformations.

For a market with a high degree of product differentiation, i.e. the German cheese market, price premiums of various cheese attributes are examined. Thereby, special attention is paid to country of origin (CO) effects, geographical indications (GIs) and organic claims. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on homescan panel data of 13,000 representative German households provided by the GfK consumer research association. The data set combines actual purchase and demographic data for a five-year sample period from 2004 to 2008. Applying the hedonic technique, the cheese price is modelled as a function of a wide range of consumer, store and product characteristics. Effects are analysed in detail by distinguishing between supply-and demand-side effects and by estimating price regressions not only for the whole sample but also for different shop types. Findings - The estimated organic price premiums range between 18 per cent in discount shops and 26 per cent in hypermarkets. The impacts of the CO and GIs are considerably smaller in magnitude and limited to special shopping venues like super- and hypermarkets. Originality/value - The German cheese market is currently evolving from a staple product market to a highly differentiated market where increasing attention is paid to quality indicators such as organic claims or GIs. The data are remarkable, both in sample size and information content. Furthermore, the estimation of shop type-specific price premiums offers new and detailed insights in consumer valuation and producer costs of a wide range of cheese attributes.","Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Schröck, R (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",rebecca.schroeck@ernaehrung.uni-giessen.de,,,"German Federal Ministry of Nutrition, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV); [2808OE148]","German Federal Ministry of Nutrition, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV);","The author would like to thank two anonymous referees for very helpful comments, which have improved considerably the quality of this paper.

Through an examination of Canadian data, the authors elucidate the implications of entrenching voluntary, extra-governmental, charitable food assistance programs as an adjunct to publicly funded social assistance programs. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Publicly available food bank reports, population health survey data, and the results of a study of low-income families in Toronto are reviewed to examine the food security status of social assistance recipients and their use of food banks. Findings - In 2012, 70 percent of households in Canada who were reliant on social assistance were food insecure. Social assistance recipients comprise at least half of food bank clientele and have done so for as long as this information has been tracked, but the assistance provided by food banks appears insufficient to alter households' food insecurity. Although food banks currently distribute over 200 million pounds of food annually, the scale of their operations pales in comparison to the food needs of those who seek their help. Originality/value - In the 30 years since food banks began in Canada, there has been considerable research into this response, as well as extensive population monitoring of food insecurity. Canada provides an informative case study of an affluent country's long-term dependency on charitable food assistance and the impact this has on the food insecurity of those reliant on social assistance programs.","[Tarasuk, Valerie; Dachner, Naomi; Loopstra, Rachel] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Tarasuk, V (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",valerie.tarasuk@utoronto.ca,"Cavicchi, Alessio/A-4477-2016; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; Loopstra, Rachel/I-7253-2013","Cavicchi, Alessio/0000-0002-7793-865X; Loopstra, Rachel/0000-0002-7541-6209","Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [FRN 115208]","Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)","This work was supported by a Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (FRN 115208).",,62,76,92,6,87,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We investigated the value of forest cover in protecting water quality in five urban lakes around Prescott, AZ. We first estimated the role of forest cover in regulating sediment loadings into each lake via a sediment delivery model. We then used 8301 single-family residential property transactions that occurred between 2002 and 2005 in Prescott, AZ, to estimate a hedonic price function. This yielded an estimate of the marginal willingness-to-pay (MWTP) for avoiding 1 t of sediment per lake-acre, from which we were able to infer the marginal willingness to pay for the erosion control services associated with a 10% change in current canopy cover. We found that the marginal value of the erosion control services of forest cover varies widely across the watersheds depending on the accessibility of affected lakes, the current level of canopy cover, and the number and value of affected residential properties among other factors.

Since meat consumption is one of the major contributors to human made environmental destruction including climate change, biodiversity loss or water and air pollution and at the same time under volitional control meat consumption is an interesting target for interventions. Design/methodology/approach - An integrated model was derived from the theory of planned behaviour, the norm activation theory and the protection motivation theory which was tested in a paper-pencil based questionnaire study including self-reported meat consumption was conducted with a convenience sample of 210 adult inhabitants of Trondheim (Norway). Findings - The model was confirmed to a large extent. Meat consumption was predicted strongly by meat eating habits, but also negatively by reduction intentions. Reduction intentions were determined by attitudes, moral beliefs and health beliefs. Moral beliefs were predicted by injunctive and descriptive norms as well as perceived behavioural control. Research limitations/implications - The study was based on a convenience sample, thus the sample is not representative. Furthermore, some of the measurement instruments are of only mediocre quality. Practical implications - The results show that interventions to reduce meat consumption need to include habits braking components to be effective. Meat consumption reduction is motivated by a broad array of motivations, including morality and health. Intervention campaigns need to cover this spectrum. Originality/value - This study is one of the first that systematically analyses determinants of meat consumption which makes it valuable in spite of its limitations.","[Zur, Ifat] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Ecol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Klockner, Christian A.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Klöckner, CA (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",christian.klockner@svt.ntnu.no,,"Klockner, Christian A./0000-0003-4510-1748",,,,,49,75,82,8,90,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, the Precautionary Principle has been widely criticised. In response to these criticisms, a qualitative version of the Precautionary Principle is developed which draws its normative content from a blend of formal decision theory and political philosophy. It is argued that precautionary action can be justified by some flexible combination of uncertainty and incommensurability. The 'greater' the uncertainty, the 'less' incommensurability is required to justify precautionary action, and vice versa. Throughout the paper, the arguments are explored using the example of climate change decision problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines whether the geographical location of such business firms influences the performance of these firms. The overarching analysis framework of this paper emerges from the recently developed Strategic Performance Management (SPM) concept for individual firms, which in the present study is extended with spatial meso-attributes related to the location of these firms. SPM aims to improve the firms' competitive performance through the application of strict internal management principles. Our study thus adopts a micro-business perspective on the organizational determinants of a firm's economic performance and its links with distinct spatial entrepreneurship conditions and general economic moderator variables. The present study focuses on both large and small and medium-sized (SME) firms, mainly operating in the creative high-tech sector in the Netherlands. The research methodology uses stepwise the following analytical tools: multivariate analysis of an extensive micro- and meso-data set on the internal performance of firms and regional covariates; Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and its recent extension to super-efficient DEA for mapping out in a comparative way the achievements of both regions and firms; a GIS-oriented statistical analysis to identify geographically discriminating factors in the firms' performance; and the design and estimation of a Structural Equations Model (SEM) for assessing the performance of the firms concerned (using what is called the flying disc model). Our results show significant differences in the performance of large vis-a-vis SME firms that have adopted SPM, while their geographical position in the country, in general, also plays a significant role.","[Kourtit, Karima; Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kourtit, K (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.kourtit@vu.nl; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,"karima, karima/AAH-3200-2019","karima, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,105,13,15,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

One discourse that is gaining popularity is the concept of environmental security, a discourse that presupposes environmental threats as urgent. The attempt to cast environmental issues as security issues has resulted in the common use of security jargon, idioms, and metaphors in policymakers' and politicians' statements. Various analyses attempt to identify why natural resources are discussed in terms and language of security. However, far fewer studies have attempted to identify differences in the manner in which different types of resources are incorporated into such a discourse by different actors and what variables contribute to this process. This study examines the construction of the security references, security arguments, and language in the statements of the Commission on Sustainable Development dealing with energy and water. We found that international organizations and Non-governmental Organizations were somewhat more likely than state actors to use security references to discuss sustainability issues. The issues securitized are not the traditional high political ones such as regime stability and conflicts, but rather issues more associated with human security, such as access to renewable energy, affordable food, and clean water. The fact that in many statements examined the use of security references was not associated with any existential threat and hence did not comply with the conditions of the Copenhagen School raises some doubts as to whether security language in these statements implies a true securitization move. We also examined whether the use of the term security by states was correlated with greater resource scarcity or vulnerability. In the case of water-related sessions, the evidence was mixed, depending on the choice of dependent variable. The results from energy security regressions, however, were inconsistent with the hypothesis that greater scarcity or vulnerability induces more use of security language.","[Fischhendler, Itay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, Jerusalem, Israel; [Katz, David] Univ Haifa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Haifa,"Katz, D (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.",fishi@mscc.huji.ac.il; katzd@geo.haifa.ac.il,"Katz, David/ABD-9038-2020","Katz, David/0000-0002-9898-2713",,,,,68,29,30,1,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The motivation behind the extension to system of SF regressions is analogous to the classical generalization to system of seemingly unrelated regressions (Zellner in J Am Statist Assoc 57:348-368, 1962). A demonstration of the copula approach is provided via the analysis of a system of two SF regressions. The consequences of ignoring the correlation between the composite errors are examined by a Monte Carlo experiment. Our findings suggest that the stronger the correlation between the two SF regressions, the more estimation efficiency is lost in separate estimations. Estimation without considering the correlated composite errors may cause significantly efficiency loss in terms of mean squared errors in estimation of the SF technical efficiency. Finally, we also conduct an empirical study based on Taiwan hotel industry data, focusing on the SF regressions for the accommodation and restaurant divisions. Our results, which are consistent with the findings in simulation, show that joint estimation is significantly different from separate estimation without considering the correlated composite errors in the two divisions.","[Lai, Hung-pin] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Huang, Cliff J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",National Chung Cheng University; Vanderbilt University,"Lai, HP (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan.",ecdhpl@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,22,25,27,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

An accurate definition of their output bundles-i.e., the services and facilities they provide to their constituencies-is essential to this research. However, several difficulties emerge in this task. First, since in most cases the law only establishes the minimum amount of services and facilities to provide, it may well be the case that some municipalities go beyond the legal minimum and, consequently, might have an uncertain effect on efficiency when compared to other municipalities which stick to the legal minimum. Second, municipalities face very different environmental conditions, which raises some doubts about the plausibility of an unconditional analysis. This study tackles these problems by proposing an analysis in which the efficiency of municipalities is evaluated after splitting them into clusters according to various criteria (output mix, environmental conditions, level of powers). We perform our estimations using order-m frontiers, given their robustness to outliers and immunity to the curse of dimensionality. We provide an application to Spanish municipalities, and results show that both output mix and, more especially, environmental conditions, should be controlled for, since efficiency differences between municipalities in different groups are notable.","[Teresa Balaguer-Coll, Maria] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Prior, Diego] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Prior, Diego] IESEG Sch Management, Catalonia, Spain; [Tortosa-Ausina, Emili] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Valenciano Invest Econ Ivie, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Autonomous University of Barcelona; IESEG School of Management; Universitat Jaume I,"Tortosa-Ausina, E (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Inst Valenciano Invest Econ Ivie, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",tortosa@uji.es,"Tortosa-Ausina, Emili/B-1205-2017","Tortosa-Ausina, Emili/0000-0002-7873-1714; Prior, Diego/0000-0002-4669-2861; Balaguer-Coll, Maria Teresa/0000-0003-2126-0963",,,,,85,55,57,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We find that more restrictive legislation reduces the economic damage caused by vessel oil spills. Based on the results of this international meta-regression, we are able to predict the marginal contributions to the damage function of the most relevant causing factors.

It aims to explore a proposed cycle for the promotion of lucerne for human consumption. Furthermore it seeks to propose lucerne as a potential vegetable and to briefly discuss the chemical composition, protein application, safety and medicinal uses of lucerne. Design/methodology/approach - A non-experimental approach, namely a systematic literature study, was used. During the study searches were done on the scientific databases Science Direct, Sabinet online, Emerald, EbscoHost and SpringerLink. Moreover internet searches were undertaken on the search engine, Google Scholar. Additionally, available textbooks and theses were consulted. Different combinations of keywords as well as synonyms for keywords were used during the searches. Some keywords used included lucerne, alfalfa and legumes. Findings - The high costs of animal protein have led to a growing interest in the industrial applications of lucerne in developing countries as lucerne is a valuable source of protein, suitable to produce nutritional food for human consumers. The full development of lucerne's potential is hindered by a lack of awareness among consumers as well as by a lack of capacity within a research community. Therefore the key steps in the proposed cycle can be used to aid in the diversification of lucerne in the market place. Originality/value - To the author's knowledge there exists a lack of previous reviews on lucerne. It is important for scientists to become aware of the nutritional and entrepreneurial potential and contribution for human consumption purposes in the future in order for the lucerne industry to diversify.","North West Univ, Sch Physiol Nutr & Consumer Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Mielmann, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Physiol Nutr & Consumer Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Annchen.Mielmann@nwu.ac.za,"Mielmann, Annchen/N-1201-2017","Mielmann, Annchen/0000-0003-4276-4239",,,,,45,37,39,7,106,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Peat moss is being used for many years as a main component of soilless media, mainly due to its excellent physical properties. Recently peat is frequently replaced by a variety of recycled, aerobically-stabilized materials, also known as composts. This trend is driven by the societal need to recycle organic wastes in an environmentally-sensitive manner, by the rising cost of peat and by peat conduciveness to several soil-borne diseases. Proper composting of many types of organic wastes achieves a number of important objectives. It should eliminate phytotoxicity, pathogens and weed seeds, and stabilize the material with respect to N and oxygen demand of microorganisms. In addition, some composts are suppressive against several soil-borne diseases. Compost maturity is a crucial characteristic in relation to its use in growing media. It ensures minimal medium shrinkage, oxygen consumption, nitrogen immobilization and phytotoxicity. Feedstocks for composts include bark, sawdust, spent mushroom compost, grape marc, composted green wastes, rice hulls, animal manures, biowaste and others. Limitations to the use of composts in growing media are their physical properties (high bulk density, low content of easily available water), salinity, high pH and rate of residual degradation with time. As a result, normally the fraction of the compost in the mixture should not exceed 50%, although some exceptions exist. Advantages of composts as ingredients of growing media include their low cost, nutritional contribution and suppressiveness against soil-borne diseases. A clear advantage of composts used in substrates is that most of them can be further recycled, after the end of the growing cycle, by soil application. Required future research includes the effect of composting techniques and feedstocks on compost characteristics and predicted performance. The effect of compost storage on the shelf life of its desirable properties should also be studied.","Agr Res Org, Dept Environm Hort, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel",VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Raviv, M (通讯作者)，Agr Res Org, Dept Environm Hort, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel.",,,,,,,,115,56,56,1,28,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66052-57-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2013,982.0,,,,,,39.0,52,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2013.982.3,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture; Soil Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGP15,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323698200003,0

However less progress has been made in understanding the internal dynamics of the economy that produce periods of slow growth, even in the absence of biophysical constraints. The real economy is a complex system, replete with myriad positive feedback loops. By looking at the economy from a systems perspective ecological economists can better understand the internal dynamics of a market system that lead to the periodic depressions and recessions that characterize the failed growth economy. A non-growing or declining economy exacerbates formidable economic problems such as unemployment, debt, and poverty. Since the middle of the 20th century governments have pursued growth strategies to solve social problems. But the age of economic growth is coming to an end, driven by its own internal dynamics and by biophysical forces such as climate change and peak oil. Degrowth implies less, and the steady state implies less on a permanent basis. Ecological economists need to pay more attention to the implications of less for a market economy and the effects upon people under our present economic configuration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

While the most common approaches to be found in the literature consider the certification of such systems to be an indicator of proactivity and cooperation with stakeholders, this article posits that it is also a mechanism firms use to discriminate between stakeholders, allowing firms to react to the pressure of certain stakeholders only. Specifically, the analyses conducted on a sample of 3748 plants reveal that the implementation of an EMS responds to pressure from stakeholders, but once this system has been certified a firm's environmental actions basically respond to the pressure from internal primary stakeholders, ignoring pressures from external primary and secondary stakeholders and regulators. The key element in the theoretical line of reasoning regarding these results is the opportunistic behavior associated with certification, given that the certification by itself represents incomplete information. Thus, an EMS can serve as a valuable shield against a majority of stakeholders, since only the pressure of those stakeholders who can verify the effects of such pressure will have an influence on the environmental behavior of firms with a certified EMS.

Weaker downstream riparian states can resort to issue linkages and side payments to coerce a change in the upstream hydro-hegemon's behavior, but the success of these tools depends on the specific political and economic situation in the basin and on the preferences of the hydro-hegemonic state for cooperation. Neglected in the literature is another possibility. Through a consideration of the sanctioned discourse of watershed management at the domestic levels, this article shows that domestic environmental non-governmental organizations and policy entrepreneurs-through the application of a range of tools-can work to change the domestic water management discourse from a state-hydraulic paradigm to a more sustainable water management paradigm. When these efforts are successful, we can find that these non-state actors can perform a crucial function in cleaning up domestic stretches of international rivers, which produces positive externalities downstream. In the process, they are able of achieving what often years of international negotiations failed to accomplish. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, India's policies on water quality in the national stretches of Ganges Basin and China's policies on biodiversity in the national stretches of the Mekong Basin are used to make this argument.","[Zawahri, Neda A.] Cleveland State Univ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Hensengerth, Oliver] Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; Northumbria University,"Zawahri, NA (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, 2121 Euclid Ave,RT 1757, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",N.zawahri@csuohio.edu,,"Hensengerth, Oliver/0000-0002-6565-692X",,,,,135,25,25,0,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We find that the increase in the self-pay ratio had a positive but insignificant effect on the share of medical expenses in household expenditure. However, when we employ the data as repeated cross-sectional observations to increase the sample size, the increase in the self-pay ratio has a significantly positive effect on the share of medical expenditures. This provides corroborating evidence that middle- and old-aged persons were unable to reduce their demand for medical services with the increase in the self-pay ratio. An additional finding is that medical services are a necessary good, particularly for those aged 61 years or older and those with medical expenditures accounting for a relatively high share of medical expenditures in high household expenditure.","[Sasaki, Masaru] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Matsuura, Tamie] NLI Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan",Osaka University,"Sasaki, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",sasaki@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21243024, 23530275] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,17,1,1,0,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

But what was the transmission channel? This article explores how the continent's financial troubles affected Britain's banking system. The freeze of Central European assets created a liquidity strain for London merchant banks because they had accepted (guaranteed) the commercial bills of German merchants. I use new balance sheet data to quantify this shock and explore how the liquidity crisis contributed to the sterling crisis.

We employed a combination of choice models to evaluate the preferences, welfare impacts and choice elasticities associated with alternative community forestry programs, allowing for different assumptions regarding heterogeneity. In line with economic theory, increased participation costs reduced the demand for community forestry, while increases in expected productivity raised the demand. With respect to preferences for the other alternatives considered: type of forest, area enclosure and type of land upon which the forest was to be situated, the results point to significant differences in preferences across the study population, suggesting that programs should be tailored to the communities in which the program is to be implemented.

Design/methodology/approach - In order to determine the antioxidant activity of oregano extract and its synergistic effect with tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), thermal oxidation was performed using the following treatments: SO, SO with 50 mg/kg of TBHQ, SO with 3,000 mg/kg of OE, and SO with 3,000 mg/kg of oregano extract and 50 mg/kg of TBHQ (mixture). The treatments underwent heating at 180 degrees C for 20 hours, and analyses of oxidative stability, total polar compounds, tocopherols and fatty acids composition were performed. The results obtained were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey test for averages at 5 percent, using the program ESTAT version 2.0. Findings - Considering the results of antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds, it was possible to verify that the ethanolic extract of oregano has presented antioxidant potential. Furthermore, considering the results obtained in the analyses of oxidative stability, polar compounds, tocopherols and fatty acids profile, it was possible to,observe that the extract has prevented lipid oxidation when added to SO.

A lack of collaboration has been identified as a key problem in many of these regions. To date, few sugar researchers have exploited the valuable supply chain collaboration knowledge available in the literature, such as the Supply Chain Collaboration Index (SCCI). This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from three sugarcane milling areas. The SCCI was contextualised from a psychological perspective and used in the quantitative data analyses. A special objective was to raise a number of pertinent questions, which would fast track stakeholders to a new level of collaboration. Findings - Many relationships in the supply chain remain relatively positive. The main attributes of concern are stability, reliability, trust, personal relationships and communication. A lack of these attributes causes fragmentation, opportunism and a desire to over-control. Mutuality and communication are key leverages in the system. Research limitations/implications - There is a need to understand how collaboration could be enhanced when stakeholders hold different balances of power. This study is still limited to sugarcane milling in South Africa. Practical implications - This paper demonstrates a partially quantitative research methodology to understand collaboration in a food supply chain. The authors also propose a tool to help industry stakeholders to resolve current problems. Originality/value - The psychological profiling of SCCI attributes and subsequent correspondence analyses is original. A framework of collaboration questions combined with Kepner-Tregoe Problem Analyses is unique. These tools are generic to any agricultural supply chain.","[Bezuidenhout, Carel Nicolaas] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Engn, Scottsville, South Africa; [Bodhanya, Shamim] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Leadership Ctr, Scottsville, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Bezuidenhout, CN (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Engn, Scottsville, South Africa.",bezuidenhoutc@ukzn.ac.za,,,South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI),South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI),"This research was funded by the South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI).

Till now, almost all of the studies in this field are trying to improve the accuracy rate of the proposed algorithms and this is the first times that trust concept is used in credit scoring domain. In this paper, a trust-based approach for credit scoring is proposed which lets the financial institutions granting their credit, based on the level of trust of the customers. The mathematical formulas are proposed to link the credit scoring domain and trust concept. At the classification stage, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - based model is used. To show the applicability and superiority of the proposed algorithm, it is performed on a credit card dataset obtained from UCI repository.","[Mirtalaei, Monireh Sadat] Univ Tafresh, Dept Ind Engn, Tafresh, Iran; [Pazhoheshfar, Peiman] Islamic Azad Univ, Tafresh Branch, Young Researchers Club, Tafresh, Iran; [Roghanian, Emad] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Saberi, Morteza] Curtin Univ Technol, Inst Digital Ecosyst & Business Intelligence, Perth, WA, Australia; [Saberi, Zahra] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; K.

Furthermore, market segmentation is attempted on the basis of specific socio-demographic characteristics, pork consumption habits and quality perception. Design/methodology/approach - A field research was performed in a Greek urban area, Thessaloniki. The research was based on consumers' quality evaluations of pork meat pictures, which were computer-manipulated to acquire different levels of two intrinsic quality cues (colour and marbling), while labels were added indicating various levels of two extrinsic quality cues (price and origin). Data were analysed by means of conjoint analysis. Findings - Results indicate that Greek consumers appear to attach more importance to marbling when forming pork quality judgments. Price is classified second in importance closely followed by colour, while country of origin appears to be the least important factor affecting quality perception of pork. Research limitations/implications - The study has employed only a number of quality cues, hypothesising that these cues principally influence consumers' decisions on pork quality. This restricted number of cues was decided so that consumers could more easily and effectively respond to the data collection procedure. As a result, some cues that could possibly be used by consumers were not included. Originality/value - Although quality perception of meat has been researched before in Greece, the procedure followed in the present study was employed for the first time to investigate quality perception of pork meat.","[Papanagiotou, Panoraia; Tzimitra-Kalogianni, Irini] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr, Dept Agr Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Melfou, Katerina] Technol Educ Inst Western Macedonia, Dept Agr Prod Mkt & Qual Control, Florina, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Papanagiotou, P (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr, Dept Agr Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",ppapanag@agro.auth.gr,"Melfou, Katerina/AAD-7185-2022","Melfou, Katerina/0000-0002-6701-9705",,,,,38,6,6,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The objective of the present work is to further investigate how consumers make choices by determining the stages as well as the content of the family's daily food (i.e. seafood and meat-related) decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach - Twenty-four families in Denmark, Norway and Iceland were asked to fill in a one-to-two-week semi-structured diary regarding any thoughts they had about the decision-making sequence regarding their evening meals. Data were analysed by means of content analysis so as to gain insight into the main themes and distinctive patterns with respect to the four stages of the decision-making sequence by identifying a number of codes and sub-codes of high and lower abstraction level. Findings - The main results were similar across the three countries. Planning was the most important phase of the evening meal decision-making sequence, where Nordic respondents considered practical issues, and engaged in a more rational type of thinking, allowing cognitive aspects to prevail at this particular stage. The presence of rational thoughts was repeated in the successive stages of purchasing, whereas affective thoughts were elicited mainly during the later stages of preparation and consumption. Furthermore, the comparison of seafood and meat as choices that complied with respondents' demands and expectations revealed that the two food types were perceived as substitutes for each other, however, meat was considered a choice that respondents felt more confident with in terms of pre- and post-purchasing experience. Originality/value - This paper offers substantial insights into the factors that influence the decision making process, as well as the importance that consumers assign to those factors across most stages of the decision making process. This valuable, in-depth information can only be collected by using qualitative methods such as the present diaries. Gaining insights into the factors that influence various stages of the evening meal decision-making process enables researchers to identify the importance that consumers assign to cognitive and affective factors across the food provisioning stages for a variety of food products (including seafood).","[Perrea, Toula] Aarhus Univ, MAPP, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Mkt & Stat, Aarhus, Denmark; [Altintzoglou, Themistoklis] Nofima Marine, Tromso, Norway; [Einarsdottir, Gunnporunn] Matis, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Luten, Joop] Nofima Market, Tromso, Norway",Aarhus University; Nofima; Nofima,"Perrea, T (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, MAPP, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Mkt & Stat, Aarhus, Denmark.",toula@asb.dk,"Altintzoglou, Themistoklis/AEO-3958-2022","Altintzoglou, Themistoklis/0000-0002-9877-966X; Perrea, Toula/0000-0002-0305-849X",New Nordic Food Program; Nordic Innovation Centre (NICEe),New Nordic Food Program; Nordic Innovation Centre (NICEe),"The authors gratefully acknowledge New Nordic Food Program and Nordic Innovation Centre (NICEe) for its financial support for the project MmmmmSeafood (Innovative concepts for culinary consumer oriented Nordic seafood products for easy use at home and for out-of home consumption), part of the NORDFOOD platform for the Nordic Identity of Regional Foods.",,54,2,4,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

(black cumin) has a unique nutritional profile that can be employed in food formulation to improve health of consumers. Black cumin is already used in traditional medicines in Pakistan to treat various maladies like diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal disorders, and as immune booster. The core objective of the present research study is to explore the role of black cumin fixed oil (BCFO) as a functional ingredient in cereal-based bakery products. Design/methodology/approach - The BCFO was supplemented in cookies' formulations and impact on nutritive quality, tocopherols and thymoquinone contents was studied. Findings - The results indicated that addition of fixed oil influenced the physical characteristics of cookies significantly. Chemical attributes varied non-significantly, but oxidative stability of the cookies was improved as indicated from decreased peroxide (POV) and TBA value. Gradual increase in BCFO in cookies formulations increased the amounts of total tocopherols significantly from 9.85 +/- 0.392 to 53.19 +/- 1.689 mg/kg-oil. BCFO addition significantly enhanced alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-tocopherols i.e. 8.80 +/- 0.630 to 32.19 +/- 1.410, 0.96 +/- 0.035 to 3.47 +/- 0.114, 0.09 +/- 0.000 to 14.98 +/- 0.520, 0.00 +/- 0.000 to 2.55 +/- 0.127 mg/kg-oil, respectively. Likewise, thymoquinone contents were recorded highest in cookies containing 5.0 @ BCFO (7.25 +/- 0.482 mg/100 g) as compared to control. Moreover, cookies containing fixed oil @ 4% rated better on hedonic scale as compared with control by the trained taste panel during sensory evaluation. Originality/value - The results of present research paved the way for the commercial applications of BCFO especially in cereal-based products. Moreover, present intervention heightened the prospects of using black cumin seed oil in different food products that may produce healthy impact on end consumers.","[Sultan, Muhammad Tauseef] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Food & Hort Sci, Multan, Pakistan; [Butt, Masood Sadiq; Saeed, Farhan; Batool, Rizwana] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Natl Inst Food Sci & Technol, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Bahauddin Zakariya University; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Sultan, MT (通讯作者)，Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Food & Hort Sci, Multan, Pakistan.",tauseefsultan@bzu.edu.pk,"Saeed, Farhan/AAB-9559-2022; Sultan, Muhammad/AAD-1337-2021; Butt, Masood Sadiq/AAZ-8801-2021; Butt, Masood Sadiq/ABB-9144-2021; Butt, Masood Sadiq/G-3031-2015; Sultan, M.

The decision making theory offers a well-developed methodological apparatus for decision making in inevitable and predictable situations. However, within a risk environment, the theory offers utilities such as the multi-attribute (multi-criteria) utility function. Regrettably this approach is too complicated for routine use by managers. This paper presents different approaches to the evaluation of options under risk. Furthermore paper summarizes their advantages and limitations. In the second part paper proposes a new approach based on connecting methods and decision making tools in risk settings (in particular, probabilistic trees, risk decision matrices and rules) using conventional multi-criteria evaluation approaches deployed during conditions of certainty. This approach is understood as a normative framework for the multi-criteria evaluation of alternatives under risk. The application of this method to management improves the quality of decision making under conditions of risk, without a significant increase in demands on the decision maker.","[Svecova, Lenka; Fotr, Jiri; Vrbova, Lucie] Univ Econ, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,,lenka.svecova@vse.cz; jiri.fotr@vse.cz; lucie.vrbova@vse.cz,"Švecová, Lenka/AAE-5194-2021","Švecová, Lenka/0000-0002-0329-2921",,,,,15,1,1,1,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,1090.0,1100,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500102,0

According to the testing and field observations, it has been verified that the system monitored well, without site operations. Therefore, the system may be applied to automatic static and dynamic displacement monitoring for both long-term and short-term without wiring and operations. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, in the real life, the young children are very interested in taking elevators as a kind of game. Few people or educational organizations pay close attention to the study of the elevator safety warning system, especially the warning pictures, which are taken as a very efficient way to prevent the potential risks. In this article, China's elevator safety publicity system and the different elevator manufacturers' designs are introduced. Because of the public utilities, the concept to carry out uniform standards in elevator safety warning is proposed. Propaganda target, picture warning content, warning way, and intensity of color are defined. To enact a consistent standard, the principles of scientific elevator safety warning pictures' system, combination of universality and particularity and color and pattern and text should be followed.

This paper aims at empirically identifying structural potentials and policy challenges for prosperity at scales where economic development remains within ecological carrying capacities. Building on the growing literature that interprets prosperity 'beyond' economic growth, the paper presents a three-dimensional concept to operationalise prosperity in terms of ecological sustainability, social inclusion, and the quality of life. These dimensions are measured using data from sources such as The World Bank, the Global Footprint Network and the OECD. The results of cluster and correspondence analyses indicate the existence of five 'prosperity regimes' and demonstrate that all aspects of prosperity - including (unsatisfactory) ecological performance - are linked to economic development. However, our findings also indicate that in order to achieve a decent minimum of prosperity moderate levels of the material living standard are sufficient Further increases in the material living standard do not lead to significant additional prosperity; instead they cause greater environmental harms. The paper concludes by highlighting potentials for prosperity for each of the 'prosperity regimes' and corresponding policy challenges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Data for the study were mainly obtained through participatory rural appraisal, village level survey, forest inventory and secondary sources. The model was run under six alternative management regimes represented by model scenarios: (1) BAU: the business as usual, (2) NSIR: no state intervention with traditional rules, (3) NRFG: no state and traditional rules, (4) NRF: no state and traditional rules without goat husbandry, (5) NFH: no forest harvesting, and (6) NGH: no goat husbandry. The results of BAU, NSIR and NRFG scenarios brought out that state control, traditional rules as well as biological feed-back mechanisms keep the goat population within carrying capacity. Comparing forest density in NSIR and NRFG model scenarios showed that even without state control, villagers managed to preserve forest resources through traditional institutional arrangements. The population of goats would decline if forest harvesting was banned due to reduction in coppicing and fodder availability. The highest NPV was observed under the NRFG model scenario resulting in lowest sustainability of resource use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In order to draw conclusions based on solid historical data, we provide a thorough reconstruction of the key balance sheet time series of Italian banks, considering all the main assets and liabilities over the last 150 years. We come to three main conclusions. First, while there was close correlation between loans and deposits (relative to GDP) until the mid-1970s, over the last 30 years, this link became more tenuous and the volume of loans has increased in relation to deposits. The banks covered this funding gap mainly by issuing new debt securities. Second, the Italian financial cycle has a much longer duration than traditional business cycles. Third, taking into account the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its trend, an acceleration of credit preceded or accompanied a banking crisis in 8 out of the 12 episodes listed by Reinhart and Rogoff (This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2009). A Logit regression confirms a positive association between the probability of a banking crisis and a previous acceleration of the credit-to-GDP gap. However, there were also periods-such as the early 1970s-in which the growth of the credit-to-GDP ratio was not followed by a banking crisis.","[De Bonis, Riccardo; Silvestrini, Andrea] Bank Italy, Econ Res & Int Relat, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Silvestrini, A (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ Res & Int Relat, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",riccardo.debonis@bancaditalia.it; andrea.silvestrini@bancaditalia.it,"Silvestrini, Andrea/B-3410-2009",,,,,,68,14,14,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2014,8.0,3,,,,,301.0,334,,10.1007/s11698-013-0103-5,0.0,,,34,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AN4XS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340593700002,0

The method applied is a choice experiment where people are asked to choose between two hypothetical wind farms characterized by different attributes. Five attributes are included in the experiment: (i) type of landscape, (ii) type of ownership, (iii) the degree of local participation in the planning process, (iv) the choice to transfer revenue to the society in a pre-specified way, and (v) a monetary cost in terms of an additional electricity certificate fee. The data are analyzed with multinomial logit, random parameter logit, and latent class models. The results indicate that consumers in Sweden are more likely to accept the higher renewable electricity certificate fee if: (a) wind power farms in areas used for recreational purposes are substantially avoided, (b) the establishment is anchored by whole or partial ownership in the local community and, (c) the locals are involved in the planning and implementation process. Our policy simulation exercise shows that respondents are willing to pay a higher electricity fee corresponding to about 0.6 Euro cents per kWh to avoid wind farms located in the mountainous area and private ownership.

In calibrating the growth function's parameters the census data are used in conjunction with rhino poaching data. The rhino population and poaching data are used to econometrically estimate a harvest function. The relationship between civil unrest and rhino poaching is identified as positive and significant. The analysis factors in the probable relationships between poaching and several additional variables - including black market rhino horn prices, potential size of black markets, and anti-poaching efforts. These variables are seen to have the predicted associations with poaching, and help isolate the latter's relationship with civil unrest in the regression models. The goodness of fit between the data on rhino population and poaching and the estimates from regression models are studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The axiomatic features of the non-parametric methods correspond closely to the procedural and economic criteria for good practice network regulation. However, critique has been voiced against the robustness of best-practice regulation in presence of uncertainty regarding model specification, data definition and collection. Incorrect data may result from structural sources, such as heterogeneous technologies; deterministic approaches applied to stochastic data generation processes or poorly defined scope of activity. Specifically within regulation, reporting may also be biased through individual gaming or collusive behavior, including the intentional provision of absurd data in order to stall or perturb regulatory process (here called maverick reporting). We review three families of outlier detection methods in terms of their function and application using a data set from Swedish electricity distribution, illustrating the different types of outliers, contrasting with the actual analysis ex post. This paper investigates the foundation of the critique both conceptually and by describing the actual state-of-the-art used in energy network regulation using frontier analysis models in Sweden (2000-2003) and in Germany (2007-). Finally, the paper concludes on the role of outlier detection as a mean to implement regulation with higher robustness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An electronic control system was designed to control stepper motors in addition to a DGPS system, which was used to determine positioning. The application map software was used to provide communication between the variable rate system and the stepper motor, computer and DGPS. In order to develop a variable rate controller, a toothed axle was fitted to the stepper motor. A variable rate controller was developed to combine cereal sowing machines. This system includes step motors for each seed metering unit as well as PIC, PDA and GPS receivers. The software was developed to create an application map and send signals to control units.

Design/methodology/approach - Structured questionnaires were randomly distributed among academic staffs and students of two universities in southern Punjab, Pakistan. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed model fit. Findings - Results of the study showed that subjective norms significantly moderate the relationship between attitudes and buying intention as well as between perceived behavior control and buying intention. Furthermore, subjective norms significantly influence attitude toward buying intention. Practical implications - The paper provides useful insights for the academics and marketers. Academics may further explore the role of subjective norms in order to have a better understanding of their effects on TPB components. Whereas, marketers can target the opinion leaders and reference groups to increase the demand of organic food. Originality/value - Majority of previous studies overlooked the role of subjective norms in determining the buying intentions with respect to organic food. The striking feature of this study is an in-depth emphasis on exploring the direct and moderating effects of subjective norms on the elements of TPB. Moreover, to the best of authors' knowledge, this is a pioneer study that comprehensively examines the linkage of components of TPB with organic food purchasing in Pakistan.","[Al-Swidi, Abdullah] Univ Utara Malaysia, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business, Sintok, Malaysia; [Huque, Sheikh Mohammed Rafiul] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Accountancy, Sintok, Malaysia; [Hafeez, Muhammad Haroon; Shariff, Mohd Noor Mohd] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Business Management, Sintok, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Hafeez, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Business Management, Sintok, Malaysia.",haroonhafeez@bzu.edu.pk,"shariff, mohd noor mohd/E-2097-2013; Hafeez, Muhammad Haroon/T-3357-2017; Al-Swidi, Abdullah/A-9397-2016; Huque, Sheikh Mohammed Rafiul/ABB-2676-2020","Hafeez, Muhammad Haroon/0000-0002-2858-2589; Al-Swidi, Abdullah/0000-0002-1718-0269; Huque, Sheikh Mohammed Rafiul/0000-0001-7435-6251",,,,,74,284,300,24,130,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

J,"Booth, S; Whelan, J",,,,"Booth, Sue; Whelan, Jillian",,,Hungry for change: the food banking industry in Australia,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food poverty; Food banks; Carol Bacchi; Corporate food system efficiency,INSECURITY,"Purpose - Over the last 20 years, food banks in Australia have expanded nationwide and are a well-organised industry operating as a third tier of the emergency food relief system. The purpose of this paper is to overview the expansion and operation of food banks as an additional self-perpetuating tier in the response to hunger. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on secondary data sourced from the internet; as well as information provided by Foodbank Australia and Food Bank South Australia (known as Food Bank SA) to outline the history, development and operation of food banks. Food banking is then critically analysed by examining the nature and framing of the social problems and policies that food banking seeks to address. This critique challenges the dominant intellectual paradigm that focuses on solving problems; rather it questions how problem representation may imply certain understandings. Findings - The issue of food banks is framed as one of food re-distribution and feeding hungry people; however, the paper argue that the problem underpinning the food bank industry is one of maintaining food system efficiency. Food banks continue as a neo-liberal mechanism to deflect query, debate and structural action on food poverty and hunger. Consequently their existence does little to ameliorate the problem of food poverty. Practical implications - New approaches and partnerships with stakeholders remain key challenges for food banks to work more effectively to address food poverty. Social implications - While the food bank industry remains the dominant solution to food poverty in Australia, debate will be deflected from the underlying structural causes of hunger. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the limited academic literature and minimal critique of the food bank industry in Australia.

We hereby present the specific governance of the social enterprise Feuille d'Erable, which was analyzed through a qualitative case study. The method of investigation used is based on the interpretation of the perceived social utility of Feuille d'Erable by its internal stakeholders. Our findings indicate that the use of a classical corporate governance model which integrates tacit emotional methods is well adapted to socially and economically fragile Generation Y workers. We suggest that the managerial performance of social enterprises catering to the needs of socially and economically excluded Generation Y individuals can be enhanced by the combination of formal and informal managerial tools.","[Descubes, Irena; McNamara, Tom] ESC Rennes Sch Business, F-35000 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business,"Descubes, I (通讯作者)，ESC Rennes Sch Business, 2 Rue Robert Arbrissel, F-35000 Rennes, France.",irena.descubes@esc-rennes.fr; tom.mcnamara@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,324.0,333,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700032,0

It also considered the inconsistencies between their animal and human food supply chains, as well as between their procurement priorities and practices. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative, cross-sectional approach was employed, involving the use of a web-based questionnaire to gather data from 41 BIAZA members across 21 indicators of food sustainability. The results were considered within a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) framework. Findings - There was considerable variation amongst the issues considered by zoos during the SFP process for their animal and human food operations. For both, local expenditure, nutritional content and packaging reduction were some of the highest scoring indicators in practice and as priorities. The overall levels of SFP were found to be equal between the human and animal food supply chains. Significantly low levels of inconsistency were found between the two, practically and in terms of procurement aspirations. Within both supply chains, there was also very few significant gaps between procurement priorities and actions. Originality/value - The originality of this study lies in its comparison of procurement practices and priorities for two contemporaneous but distinct food supply chains. It demonstrates that it is possible to have a high overall degree of consistency between two parallel, but contrasting, supply chains, as well as between procurement priorities and priorities. It will be of use in SSCM, particularly within values-led organisations.","[Hanson, Jonathan; Holt, Diane] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Hanson, Jonathan] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",Queens University Belfast; University of Cambridge,"Hanson, J (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",jh847@cam.ac.uk,"Holt, Diane/A-6763-2015","Holt, Diane/0000-0002-2945-5207",,,,,53,3,3,0,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Such problem foods are important risks for avoidable cardio-vascular disease and diabetes burdens. Design/methodology/approach - The source population were members of the nationwide Thai Cohort Study (TCS) followed since 2005 (n = 87,151) for a study of the health-risk transition. For this report we used a multi-region sub-sample (n = 1,516) of TCS members responding to an additional questionnaire about food environments, shopping patterns and food consumption. By using a TCS sub-sample we gained access to four years (2005-2009) of longitudinal observations on a wide array of variables related to health and wellbeing from an informative group. Findings - Overall 85 per cent of the sample now have access to supermarkets; ten years ago the figure was 47 per cent, and when aged ten years, 5 per cent. Now half the participants regularly visit supermarkets and convenience stores, especially urban dwellers with higher incomes. Frequent shopping at supermarkets and convenience stores associated with consumption of six problem foods (soft drinks, snack foods, processed meats, western style bakery items, instant foods and deep fried foods). Frequent fresh market shopping was associated with increased vegetable intake. There was no association between food shopping and body mass index, diabetes or hypertension but supermarket shopping was related to hyperlipidaemia. Research limitations/implications - Modernization of food retailing is changing Thai diets and creating diet-related health risks. Originality/value - The paper addresses a knowledge gap on links between modernizing food retail in Asia and consumption of unhealthy foods, revealing strong linkage in transitional Thailand.","[Kelly, Matthew; Seubsman, Sam-ang; Banwell, Cathy; Dixon, Jane; Sleigh, Adrian] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Seubsman, Sam-ang] Sukhothai Thammathirat Open Univ, Sch Human Ecol, Nonthaburi, Thailand",Australian National University; Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University,"Kelly, M (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",matthew.kelly@anu.edu.au,"Kelly, Matthew/ABC-1069-2020; sleigh, adrian/J-4540-2019","Kelly, Matthew/0000-0001-7963-2139; sleigh, adrian/0000-0001-8443-7864; Banwell, Cathy/0000-0001-6808-1052; Seubsman, Sam-ang/0000-0002-7451-3218; Dixon, Jane/0000-0003-4658-4307",Wellcome Trust UK [GR071587MA]; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC268055]; NHMRC [585426],Wellcome Trust UK(Wellcome Trust); Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"This research was supported by the International Collaborative Research Grants Scheme with joint grants from the Wellcome Trust UK (GR071587MA) and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC268055) and a Global Health grant from the NHMRC (585426).

The created clusters can serve for dimensionality reduction by choosing one of the variables from a group of similar variables as a representative for the whole group. A suitable way for variable clustering is to apply hierarchical cluster analysis based on a proximity matrix expressing relationships for all pairs of variables. For measurement of similarity of nominal variables special measures have to be used, e.g. contingency coefficients, symmetric variants of directional dependence measures, measures of agreement, and coefficients determined for measurement of a similarity of objects characterized by nominal variables (for variables with categories of the same meaning). In the paper, the following measures are applied: Cramer's V, the symmetric uncertainty coefficient, the kappa coefficient of agreement, and the simple matching (overlap) coefficient. In addition, the Jaccard coefficient is used for binary variables and the agreement is measured by the Hamann coefficient for this type of variables. The complete method of hierarchical cluster analysis is applied to sets of variables from a sociological research. For evaluation of the created clusters, the within-cluster variability based on the Gini coefficient is considered.","Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Rezanková, H (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",hana.rezankova@vse.cz,"Rezankova, Hana/G-2103-2014; Rezankova, Hana/P-8370-2018","Rezankova, Hana/0000-0002-4131-5506",,,,,12,2,2,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1293.0,1302,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700126,0

Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports the results of a field study of 602 chili farmers in the largest chilli production area in Indonesia, West Java Province. The contractual arrangements were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while determinants of farmers' commitment were examined using factor analysis and Ordinary Least square (OLS) regression. Findings - The contractual arrangements between farmers and traders in both traditional and supermarket channels are characterized by verbal agreements. Price is the main aspect of the contract in the traditional channel, while grading aspects are the most important aspects in the supermarket channel. Trust and satisfaction have significant influence on farmers' commitment in the two channels, while the actual price has no influence. Practical implications - To improve farmers' commitment, traders should not only focus on absolute price, but also on building trust and satisfaction. Trust can be improved by providing payments on time and following through with their promises. Satisfaction can be improved by offering fair prices for farmers' products and providing quicker responses in handling farmers' concerns. Originality/value - This study compares the trade relationships between traditional and supermarket channels. It incorporates actual price and behaviour variables in the analysis of farmers' commitment.","[Sahara, Sahara] Univ Adelaide, Global Food & Agr Business Program, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Gyau, Amos] West & Cent Africa Reg ICRAF WCA, World Agroforestry Ctr, Yaounde, Cameroon",University of Adelaide,"Sahara, S (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Global Food & Agr Business Program, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",sahara_ipb@yahoo.com,,,Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR),Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res),"This paper is made possible by financial support from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).

A variety of DEA quality indices and a DEA variety of efficiency models are compared to determine how the treatment of quality influences findings regarding technical efficiency. Controlling for efficiency does matter, with outcome measures having an apparently greater impact than process measures. Given the call for improved quality and better cost containment, controlling for quality is an important contribution to efficiency analysis.","[Ferrier, Gary D.; Trivitt, Julie S.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Ferrier, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",gferrier@walton.uark.edu,,"Ferrier, Gary/0000-0001-7301-7928",,,,,63,52,57,2,94,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

To optimize the cost and facing the transportation demands of all departments, a mathematical model is designed and solved by a commercial software package. Also, the number of vehicles allocated to each parking facility is determined. A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm combining a genetic algorithm with parallel simulated annealing is developed which can be used even in more complicated structure of the problem.

This study uses the heights of some 4,000 individuals who served during the Second World War to quantify biological living standards from the 1900s to the 1920s, and focuses primarily on socioeconomic inequality during this period. The results suggest that generally the upper social strata, measured by fathers' occupation, exhibited the tallest average height, followed by the middle and lower classes. These socioeconomic differences became more pronounced during the First World War when the rationing system provided a limited food supply. Wealthier individuals were able to purchase additional foodstuffs on black markets. Therefore, children from upper-class families experienced only a small decline in average height compared to their counterparts from the middle and lower social strata.","Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Blum, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,60,23,25,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

These attempts are based on a confusion of concepts, however. In this article, two types of non-use values are distinguished: warm glow value, related to the satisfaction people may derive from altruism towards nature, and existence value, related to the satisfaction people may derive from the mere knowledge that nature exists and originating in the human need for self-transcendence. As benefits to humans, warm glow and existence values can be considered ecosystem services. Neither warm glow value nor existence value represents benefits to nature itself, however. Intrinsic value lies outside the scope of the wide palette of ecosystem services. Although the concept of ecosystem services does not cover benefits to nature and the intrinsic value of such benefits, intrinsic value is not necessarily incompatible with economic valuation. Although a deontological ethics does not allow economic valuation of nature as an end in itself, consequentialism does. In consequentialism, however, intrinsic value is not attributed to nature itself, but to benefits to nature. These benefits can be economically valued on the basis of benefit transfer.

This article highlights a relatively ignored aspect of the problem, arguing that the state, politics, and political economic ideology played a central role. In particular, the early eighteenth-century political victory of a version of political economy associated with the Whig party, which centred on manufacturing and consumption, was a prerequisite for the economic developments later in the century. The article begins by describing a political economy of manufacturing and its rival, a political economy of re-exporting associated with the Tory party. It then explains how and why a political economy of manufacturing became dominant, examining both political elites and ordinary voters and petitioners. The growth of manufacturing and consumption must be understood, therefore, as political as much as economic events.","East Stroudsburg Univ, East Stroudsburg, PA USA",,"Dudley, C (通讯作者)，East Stroudsburg Univ, East Stroudsburg, PA USA.",,,,,,,,45,9,12,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The paper maintains that migration would expand an individual's economic choices and opportunities and allow diversification. Consequently, diversification advantages influence the location decisions of migrants, an effect captured by the correlation of incomes at the origin and potential destinations. We use the discrete choice model based on random utility maximization as the framework for our empirical investigation of migration from the United States rural to urban counties. This paper takes advantage of an equivalent relation between the conditional logit model and Poisson regression to study the migration decisions using aggregate data among a large set of spatial alternatives. The results show that the diversification concerns have significant effects on location decisions of the rural-urban migrants in the United States.","[Arzaghi, Mohammad] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah 26666, U Arab Emirates; [Rupasingha, Anil] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA",American University of Sharjah; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Arzaghi, M (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah 26666, U Arab Emirates.",marzaghi@aus.edu; anil.rupasingha@atl.frb.org,,"Rupasingha, Anil/0000-0002-2380-8358",,,,,53,16,24,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

When we isolate the value of industrial incentives from the basic tax system in our theoretically preferred marginal tax measure, we find that a 10 percent reduction in liability achieved by way of lowering taxes is associated with a 4.5 percent increase in value added while an equivalent reduction achieved by way of increasing incentives is associated with only 1.2 percent industrial growth, the latter elasticity not statistically different from zero.","[Funderburg, Richard] Univ Iowa, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Bartik, Timothy J.] WE Upjohn Inst Employment Res, Kalamazoo, MI 49007 USA; [Peters, Alan H.] Univ New S Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Fisher, Peter S.] Iowa Policy Project, Iowa City, IA 52245 USA",University of Iowa; W.E.

Use of this drilling technology to extract natural gas from hitherto impermeable shale is expected to increase even more in coming decades. Two institutions, integration contracts and well spacing requirements, evolved to mitigate the common-pool economic wastes associated with conventional oil and gas drilling. U.S. regulators have applied these institutions to fracking. However, shale plays differ geologically from conventional plays and are subject to different extractive technologies. We theorize that the point-source pollution characteristics of conventional drilling allowed integration contracts and well space requirements to minimize local negative environmental externalities as an unintended byproduct of minimizing common-pool economic wastes. The non-point source pollution characteristics of fracking, however, make these institutions insufficient to minimize negative environmental externalities associated with drilling in shale plays, because the economic waste problem is different. If policymakers understand the crucial differences between conventional oil and gas plays and shale plays and the drilling technologies applied to them, they should be better equipped to craft fracking regulatory policies that internalize problematic externalities.

Thereby, IEAs may help to effectively curb environmental pollution. However, previous attempts to empirically measure institutional effectiveness found it difficult to provide credible estimates because they have missed to produce convincing counterfactuals. This study empirically estimates the effectiveness of one prominent example of an international environmental institution, the Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution agreement (LRTAP). It sets forth a transparent identification strategy in light of latest advancements in the causal inference literature and presents evidence for the non-effectiveness of the LRTAP in changing member states' behavior in terms of anthropogenic emissions of two substances (NO (x) and SO2). By deriving and illustrating the use of difference-in- differences (DID) design in the context of IEAs, this study provides a general methodological tool kit to drawing causal inferences about the effectiveness of international environmental institutions.","[Vollenweider, Juerg] ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Vollenweider, Juerg] IED, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Vollenweider, J (通讯作者)，ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, IFW C 43-1,Haldeneggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",jvollenweider@ir.gess.ethz.ch,,,,,,,57,19,19,2,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It was the French social theorist Michel Foucault (1926-1984) who coined the term episteme to refer to the possibility of knowledge that determines the development of thought and knowledge in a given period. For Foucault epistemes were the buried foundations of knowledge that his epistemic archaeology could unearth. In 2007, Foucault was identified as the most cited author of books in the humanities by Thomson Reuters' ISI Web of Science. This paper begins with a brief definition and description of epistemic analyses. A summary analysis of the Modern episteme and neoclassical economics is then provided and this is followed by outline evidence for the emerging episteme.

We provide an explanation by developing a two-region model with mobile labor, production externalities and endogenous natural amenities. We find that strong preferences for natural amenities generally foster population dispersion. However, such preferences can also lead to population concentration when ecological degradation is low and man-made capital is a relatively scarce input into natural amenity production. Investments that enhance natural amenities are found to reduce the divergence between the steady state and optimal outcomes.","[Chen, Yong] Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Irwin, Elena G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Jayaprakash, Ciriyam] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Oregon State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 219B Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",yong.chen@oregonstate.edu; irwin.78@osu.edu; jayaprakash.1@osu.edu,,"Irwin, Elena/0000-0001-7908-5964","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1127044, 1127055] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,13,6,9,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Yet although peasants comprised the majority of the population, and were responsible for the greater part of land use, surprisingly little is known about peasant cropping patterns and production strategies. Taking the Crowland Abbey manor of Oakington, Cambridgeshire as a case study, this article examines peasant land use and agricultural strategies. Using data collected from the Oakington tithe accounts and manor court rolls, this article demonstrates that peasants used their land more extensively than did the lord, raising their output per acre above that of the demesne. This was driven by peasant need for fodder crops, and the strain placed on agricultural systems that required peasants to use their land to produce grains and legumes for consumption, fodder, and sale.","Newnham Coll, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Sapoznik, A (通讯作者)，Newnham Coll, Cambridge, England.",,,,,,,,84,13,13,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The idea behind REDD+ is that payments for sequestering carbon can tip the economic balance away from loss of forests and in the process yield climate benefits. Recent analysis has suggested that developing country carbon sequestration can effectively compete with other climate investments as part of a cost effective climate policy. This paper focuses on opportunities and complications associated with bringing community-controlled forests into REDD+. About 25% of developing country forests are community controlled and therefore it is difficult to envision a successful REDD+ without coming to terms with community controlled forests. It is widely agreed that REDD+ offers opportunities to bring value to developing country forests, but there are also concerns driven by worries related to insecure and poorly defined community forest tenure, informed by often long histories of government unwillingness to meaningfully devolve to communities. Further, communities are complicated systems and it is therefore also of concern that REDD+ could destabilize existing well-functioning community forestry systems.

We develop a model of cost-minimizing surveillance and control of forest pathogens across multiple sites where there is uncertainty about the extent of the infestation in each site and when the goal is to minimize the expected number of new infections. We allow for a heterogeneous landscape, where grid cells may be differentiated by the number of trees, the expected number of infected trees, rates of infection growth, and costs of surveillance and control. In our application to oak wilt in Anoka County, Minnesota, USA, we develop a cost curve associated with saving healthy trees from infection. Assuming an annual infection growth rate of 8%, a $1 million budget would save an expected 185 trees from infection for an average of $5400 per tree. We investigate how more precise prior estimates of disease and reduced detection sensitivity affect model performance. We evaluate rules of thumb, finding that prioritizing sites with high proportions of infected trees is best. Our model provides practical guidance about the spatial allocation of surveillance and control resources for well-studied forest pathogens when only modest information about their geographic distribution is available.

Findings - were categorised based on the form, function and appearance of packaging design. Findings - Results highlighted that the majority of participants found milk packaging to be functional; however, beyond this use, vast improvement could be made in terms of the aesthetics surrounding packaging design. Research limitations/implications - Even for commodity products the use of packaging transcends beyond a functional role as consumers are becoming more demanding in their attitudes towards packaging design. Practical implications - The study provides insights for managers in relation to opportunities for adding value through packaging design within the liquid milk sector. Originality/value - The paper explores consumer attitudes towards milk packaging to identify possible new market opportunities.","[Hollywood, Lynsey] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Armstrong, Gillian] Univ Ulster, Dept Accounting, Newtownabbey, North Ireland; [Farley, Heather] Univ Ulster, Dept Management, Newtownabbey, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast; Ulster University; Ulster University,"Hollywood, L (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",l.hollywood@qub.ac.uk,,"Hollywood, Lynsey/0000-0003-3918-6255",,,,,61,27,36,4,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

By combining a biophysical crop model with an economic supply model we were able to predict and quantify this effect at a fine spatial resolution. We applied our approach to the very varied French case and showed that ozone has significant productivity and land-use effects. A comparison of moderate and high ozone scenarios for 2030 shows that wheat production may decrease by more than 30% and barley production may increase by more than 14% as surface ozone concentration increases. These variations are due to the direct effect of ozone on yields as well as to modifications in land use caused by a shift toward more ozone-resistant crops: our study predicts a 16% increase in the barley-growing area and an equal decrease in the wheat-growing area. Moreover, mean agricultural gross margin losses can go as high as 2.5% depending on the ozone scenario, and can reach 7% in some particularly affected regions. A rise in ozone concentration was also associated with a reduction of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions of about 2%, as a result of decreased use of nitrogen fertilizers. One noteworthy result was that major impacts, including changes in land use, do not necessarily occur in ozone high concentration zones, and may strongly depend on farm systems and their adaptation capability. Our study suggests that policy makers should view ozone pollution as a major potential threat to agricultural yields. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze three regimes: a decentralized economy where each household makes isolated choices without considering their external effects, a planned economy where a myopic planner fails to recognize both leisure and consumption externalities but recognizes production externalities, and a planned economy with a fully informed planner. We first compare the balanced growth paths under the three regimes and then we numerically investigate the transition to the optimal balanced growth path. We provide a number of findings. First, in a decentralized economy growth or labor (or both) are greater than in the regime with a fully informed planner, and hence are sub-optimal from a welfare standpoint. Second, a myopic intervention which over-looks consumption and leisure externalities leads to more growth and labor than in both the decentralized and the fully informed regime.

The paper also analyses the Spanish governments' graduation to responsible public debt management under democracy and the last debt crisis starting in 2010. After analysing the evolution of the outstanding public debt, budget deficits, the Spanish economy's ability to borrow, the central government's debt affordability and the profile of public debt, the article concludes that the Spanish case confirms the main hypotheses of concerning international debt crises: short-term borrowing enhanced the risk of a debt crisis; insolvency problems arose when governments were unwilling or unable to repay debt; debt crises took place after large capital inflows; most outright defaults ended up being partial defaults; public debt level became unsustainable when it rose above 60-90 per cent of GDP; default trough inflation became commonplace when fiat money displaced coinage; financial repression was used as a subtle type of debt restructuring; and defaults endangered the creditworthiness of the Spanish Finance Ministry and forced disciplined fiscal policies.","Univ Alcala, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Econ & Hist Econ, Madrid 28802, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Comín, F (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Econ & Hist Econ, Plaza Victoria 3, Madrid 28802, Spain.",francisco.comin@uah.es,,,,,,,36,12,12,1,31,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Recent research has documented cases of regime shifts in local and regional systems and there is mounting concern about regime shifts of global significance. In this paper we discuss management of social-ecological systems in light of the potential for regime shift. Management that increases system resilience and lowers the probability of regime shifts is beneficial when regime shifts are likely to reduce human well-being. It may not always be possible to avoid harmful regime shifts, so building capacity to adapt should a regime shift occur is beneficial too. Adaptive management can help reduce uncertainty about the likelihood of regime shifts, how this likelihood can be affected by management action, and the impact of regime shifts on well-being. Linking scientific understanding with decision-making is important but distributional consequences can impede decision making and action. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One of them is the pushing of economic growth. In the present economy, accumulation of capital is an end in itself. According to the Golden Rule of Accumulation, the extension rate of the capital stock is equal to the interest rate. However, in the present economic conditions the interest rate is always significantly higher than zero, due to the liquidity premium of money (Keynes). In this context, old proposals such as the free money approach of Silvio Gesell could provide interesting solutions. Gesell wanted to neutralize the liquidity premium by putting artificial carrying costs on money. By increasing the stock of capital assets without being interrupted by economic crises, the interest and profitability level should be reduced down to zero. Because in this situation every marginal saving and marginal investment would cause a negative interest or profitability rate, they would be stopped. Though Keynes was very excited by the proposals of Gesell, he criticized the fact that Gesell did not see many of the further obstacles. However, these obstacles could be overcome by means of further institutional reforms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A fixed effect panel data specification is used to control for the heterogeneity in the data. Mean-while, spatial autocorrelation is also diagnosed by a statistical methodology that allows us to split the model in subsamples (clusters) of more homogenous municipalities. The clustering analysis shows that there are three clusters whose land-use patterns are strongly different in an economical point of view. The first cluster identifies municipalities dedicated to logging, natural resources exploitation and slash-and-burn cultures; the second cluster shows a more diversified agriculture; while the third cluster presents very developed intensive agriculture municipalities. Another contribution of this article relies on the assessment of contemporaneous causal relation among distinct land-uses areas. This new approach allows us to evaluate the dynamics relations arisen from unexpected innovations in the process of soil occupation. The impulse response functions (IRF) and the forecast error variance decompositions (FEVD) generate the following results: (1) in the opposition direction of previous studies, we find that the demand for cropping does not require to clear new areas of forest.; (2) contrary to previous studies we do not find indication that cattle ranching is the primary driver of deforestation; (3) the impact of a shock of pasture land on itself is virtually null at the initial stages, but increases over time, not requiring to clear extra areas of forest land but rather competing with crop land; (4) it seems that if not for all the Amazon Basin, at least in one cluster, cattle ranching and cropping could be competitive activities; and (5) we find out that in the long run pasture innovation is responsible for the major percent of the forecast error concern all land uses. It probably means that the destiny of distinct categories of land, in cluster one, is endogenously determine by activities connected to cattle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, here we propose a hypothesis, based on a game theory model, that the social norm of fairness rather than self-interest might motivate cooperation in natural resource conservation by discounting the utility gain from illegal logging at the cost of another household's subsidy loss. In Wolong Nature Reserve of China, a recent household-based natural forest conservation program has led to remarkable progress in protecting the habitat of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) with low monitoring pressure. We undertook experiments based on a one-shot Ultimatum Game to test the prevalence of the norm of fairness in the local communities. Most proposers in the experiments showed strong preferences for fair offers in spite of the responders' reluctance to reject low offers, and the result contradicted the expectation of pure self-interest. Taking into account the norm of fairness, the prediction of the model is consistent with the local performance of the household-based conservation policy. It highlights the potential of local social norms to facilitate participation and cooperation by the local community in common natural resource conservation.

This analysis reports a unique longitudinal study of individual farmers' perspectives using Q methodology, with a group of UK farmers' opinions assessed in both 2001 and 2008. Three main outcomes are evident. Firstly, the set of farmers' perspectives identified in 2001 appears to be still adequate to summarise the range of views present in 2008; thus substantially new sets of concerns do not appear to be forming over this period. Secondly, the proportions of farmers aligning themselves with particular perspectives appear to have shifted, indicating some clear reorientations of attitudes. Thirdly, these shifts indicate a small number of specific directions of change, oriented towards more productivist positions and away from more environmental interests. In summary, the key dimensions of agri-environmental concern amongst farmers overall do not appear to be significantly changing over this period, but the proportions of farmers that are sensitive to particular concerns do appear to have undergone some change. Given the unusual methodology, sample size and recruitment methods used these results most certainly cannot be translated into population-wide effects, but they do provide a valuable opportunity for consideration of pathways of change.

This reflected the Americanization of smoking tastes and threatened domestic tax revenue. The popular preference for 'American blend' cigarettes also hindered trade with Greece and Turkey, suppliers of Oriental tobacco to German manufacturers. The proposed solution was tax cuts to stimulate demand for domestically produced cigarettes. These proposals antagonized welfare groups, who saw tax cuts as a threat to the health of the population.

Initially, the rent-seeking behaviour of both the supply firm and the City Hall at the local level affected the expansion of the local electricity market. During the 1930s, this collusion at municipal level coincided with unpredictable energy policies at state level. This circumstance impeded the indispensable increase of scale and the building of a regional market of electricity in north Portugal. The literature on regulation and institutional analysis has proved very useful. Finally, though equally important, primary sources from company archives and institutional bodies were also employed.","Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Seville 41018, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Rodríguez, IB (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Av Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",mbartolome@us.es,"BARTOLOMÉ-RODRÍGUEZ, ISABEL/K-5165-2014","BARTOLOMÉ-RODRÍGUEZ, ISABEL/0000-0001-9219-2916",,,,,61,3,3,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

We aggregate personal income micro data to the state level, differentiating nine income sources, and assess the role of these components in the observed changes in regional inequality indicators. The main results indicate that the largest part of the recent reduction in regional inequality is related to the dynamics of the market-related labor income, with manufacturing and services favoring deconcentration. Labor income in agriculture, retirement and pensions, and property rents and other sources favored concentration. The social programs Bolsa Familia and Beneficios de Prestacao Continuada are responsible for more than 24 percent of the reduction in inequality, although they account for less than 1.7 percent of the disposable household income. Such positive impact on regional concentration is impressive, since the goals of the programs are clearly nonspatial.","[Silveira-Neto, Raul M.] Univ Fed Pernambuco, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Azzoni, Carlos R.] Univ Sao Paulo, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Silveira-Neto, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Pernambuco, Av Prof Moraes Rego 1235, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil.",rau.silveira@uol.com.br; cazzoni@usp.br,,,,,,,46,19,19,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Taking Anglo-Saxon England as a case study, it is suggested that political restrictions led to the establishment of direct and indirect taxation, thereby providing rulers with revenues which surpassed those from domain resources. The main section of the article uses sources from coinage and wills to poetry and letters in order to give a general idea of the chronological development of a medieval tax state. This analysis challenges the views of the new fiscal historians, who argue that a collapse in a medieval domain state acts as the precondition for the emergence of a tax state. Instead, this article suggests that new policies arose because of the need of Anglo-Saxon kings and their advisers to take account of the requirements of ecclesiastical authorities, as well as a heavy revenue imperative, in paying for resistance against the Vikings. The article ends with a discussion of the comparative applications of the contexts and catalysts which lead to the adoption of pioneering fiscal policies.","Univ Roehampton, London, England",Roehampton University,"Wareham, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roehampton, London, England.",,,,,,,,132,10,11,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We developed a timber rent model that estimates optimal stumpage fees and compared three scenarios of harvestable areas access versus two harvest methods to calculate potential revenues to the State. We found that current stumpage fees undervalue timber resources and thus provide windfall profits to loggers. Annual forest revenues to the State could be increased from US$1 million to a maximum annual average of US$23.4 +/- 1.4 million over a 20-year period if the fee structure suggested from our estimations were adopted. Similarly, we show that the spatial distribution of current fees encourages timber harvesting outside of timber concessions, in particular from Brazil-nut concessions, which compete with timber concessions to supply timber to markets. Our results suggest that timber harvesting should be limited to a maximum volume of 5 m(3)/ha inside Brazil-nut concessions and that timber harvesting in all Madre de Dios could be increased by up to similar to 200% over the next 20 years without threatening conservation areas.

Using a Generalized Uncertainty Ramsey Rule derived from a model that separates intertemporal substitution and risk aversion, we find that the U.S. historical data on consumption growth and asset returns imply that (i) for the reciprocal of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution less than or equal to one, rho lies within +/- 1% from zero for a plausible range of the coefficient of relative risk aversion; and (ii) for the larger reciprocal of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, rho tends to be negative. These results contradict the widely-held belief in the environmental economics literature that the inferred rho must be significantly larger than zero and suggest that it is appropriate to use rho = 0 as a benchmark for economic analysis of environmental policies.

While they are inherently linked and thus should be part of the integrated processes of ecosystem management, they have been largely pursued separately. The majority of restoration ecologists and socioeconomic scholars tend to dwell in their own comfort zone and concentrate on different, disciplinary facets of the same issues. However, this situation is not conducive to the accomplishment of their common cause. The objective of this paper is to make a case for more effective efforts in integrating ecological restoration programs and payments for ecosystem services and thus more substantive interdisciplinary collaboration in the science and practice of ecological restoration and ecosystem service provision. To that end, the relevant research developments and bodies of literature are carefully reviewed, and China's recent experience and lessons in retiring and converting degraded cropland extensively presented. It is hoped that these efforts will highlight the challenges and opportunities in the current state of affairs and convince scientists in different disciplines to work together in better and more broadly integrated research of ecological restoration programs and payments for ecosystem services.

The main hypothesis of this paper is that the radical policies implemented as part of the Great Leap Forward resulted in agricultural output decline (i.e., availability issues), and in the implementation of an ineffective food distribution policy affecting rural populations (i.e., accessibility issues). An econometric analysis, based on provincial panel data from the 1954-1966 period, stresses the effect of ill-advised economic policies in handling the famine. This analysis also confirms that the increase in mortality rates during the famine was caused by the simultaneous collapse in food availability and food accessibility in rural areas.","Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, UMR CNRS 5113, Bordeaux, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Clément, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, UMR CNRS 5113, Bordeaux, France.",matthieu.clement@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,56,8,9,0,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2012,6.0,1,,,,,89.0,114,,10.1007/s11698-011-0065-4,0.0,,,26,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,870FK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298654300006,0

The goal of this study is to identify food applications that are more likely and food applications that are less likely to be accepted by the public. Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted in Mexico and was a replica of a study conducted in Switzerland. Another goal is to compare the acceptance ratings of citizens from a highly developed European country to the ratings of citizens from a less developed country. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in three different places in Mexico, which yielded N = 378 datasets. Findings - Affect and perceived control are important factors influencing risk and benefit perceptions. Applications that can be consumed are perceived as more controllable than applications related to the packaging or external use. The results are similar but not identical to the findings from Switzerland. Research limitations/implications - A convenience sample was used that was clearly more highly educated than the average population. One should be cautious when generalizing the findings. Practical implications - It is important to pay attention to public views regarding new technologies in the food business during the product development stage to avoid some of the pitfalls that GM technology had.

Design/methodology/approach - As a theoretical basis, two existing approaches, the switch (S) and the successive switch (SS) models, were examined and adjusted. The integration of both approaches led to the expanded switch of brands (SB) model. SB was tested empirically using panel data for a highly developed food market (the Austrian food market for three product categories, i.e. fruit juice, fruit yoghurt, and chocolate, with data for 2007 and 2008). Findings - The integration of S and SS into the expanded SB model succeeded. Based on an annual comparison, the reliability of the SB model was tested. Since the results can be reproduced, it can be determined that the SB model is reliable. To test the explanatory power, a variable assessing brand loyalty (brand purchase frequency) was introduced. Correlation analyses showed that the expanded variety-seeking model is more appropriate for approximating VSB than either S or SS. Research limitations/implications - The SB model is still very basic, integrating only three variables. Other influencing variables have to be considered to further improve the significance of the SB model. Practical implications - The expanded VSB model can be applied in all product categories and markets where panel data are available. It helps to analyse panel data in view of consumers' variety seeking and brand switching behavior. Originality/value - The expanded variety-seeking model (SB) is easy to implement and gives valid information on VSB. It can be used for marketing decisions, especially in connection to brand management.","[Meixner, Oliver; Knoll, Viktoria] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Mkt & Innovat, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Meixner, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Mkt & Innovat, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria.",oliver.meixner@boku.ac.at,"Meixner, Oliver/AAD-6219-2021","Meixner, Oliver/0000-0002-8505-3130",ONB Jubilaumsfonds,ONB Jubilaumsfonds,"The authors would like to thank the Austrian National Bank, which promoted this study with funds from the ONB Jubilaumsfonds, and Tobias Schediwy from GfK Austria, who made it possible for the authors to work with the original consumer tracking panel data.

External sources are very restrictive and expensive, thus, the chances of economic recovery mostly depend on national savings. The main sector of a national economy that is saving is the household sector and for this reason the saving and consumption behaviour are of utmost importance for the financial stability of a country. Therefore, the anti-crisis and economic recovery governmental programmes should include financial policies that stimulate savings, based on an as rigorous knowledge of these behaviours as possible. Pertinent results in the analysis of the saving behaviour of the households may be quickly obtained with the help of data from selective studies.

However, it is not known whether this so-called neutrally marinated meat will be appropriated by consumers in the long term, or will be destined to be a marginal second rate product. The purpose of this paper is to explore the views of consumers on neutrally marinated meat, including acceptance and potential problems for appropriation. Design/methodology/approach - Four focus group interviews were conducted involving 27 Danish consumers with various socio-demographic backgrounds. Findings - The interviewed consumers had very little prior knowledge of neutrally marinated meat, and expressed ambivalent attitudes when introduced to it. They had favourable reactions to its taste, texture and robustness and saw the potentially low price as a positive feature. But they also viewed neutrally marinated meat as unnatural, unauthentic and potentially risky to health. Furthermore, concern was expressed due to the lack of information available to consumers and due to suspicion of unfair prices. The focus group interviews also showed that categorisation of neutrally marinated meat in different social contexts is not settled, underlining a sense of ambivalence among consumers. So, even though neutrally marinated meat is being consumed it is unclear if and when conceptual appropriation will take place. Originality/value - This study provides a broader perspective on consumer perception of new products than found in conventional sensorial tests, including views on the processing, health aspects, ethical aspects and convenience aspects.","[Nissen, Nina Konstantin; Holm, Lotte] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Human Nutr, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Nissen, Nina Konstantin; Holm, Lotte] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sandoe, Peter] Univ Copenhagen, Danish Ctr Bioeth & Risk Assessment, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Nissen, NK (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Human Nutr, Copenhagen, Denmark.",nikn@foi.dk,"Holm, Lotte/L-7954-2014; Sandoe, Peter/E-8758-2015","Holm, Lotte/0000-0003-0667-7779; Sandoe, Peter/0000-0003-0397-3273","Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries - Danish Food Industry Agency","Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries - Danish Food Industry Agency","Acknowledgments to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries - Danish Food Industry Agency that supported this study.",,24,2,2,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Psychology Fatigue Measurement System was established in the experiment. Critical flicker fusion test, perceptual speed test, distribution of attention value test, reaction time test were used to test drivers of three types of buses, and then Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used to calculate significance of data changes with SPSS. This thesis reveals the Beijing bus drivers' fatigue evaluation index changing trends under different driving models and running time.

The household choosing farming or out-migration as a main livelihood strategy was more likely to escape from persistent poverty than those taking local non-agricultural employment.

Over 1300 past and present federal and state biofuel laws and incentives were analyzed to identify the establishment of Life-cycle thinking (Lr) in the biofuel policies. The policies were searched for search terms representing the three themes: life cycle assessment, environmental impact and sustainability. LCT in policies was first seen in the Renewable Fuel Standard under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, where life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction of biofuels was required. Existing U.S. biofuel policies were also characterized to define types of policy as tax incentive, grants, mandate, etc. The results suggested that climate change or energy incentives, air quality or emissions, etc. should be more emphasized in fuel legislation for a continuous improvement of biofuels industry. Only 13% of both the federal and state policies reviewed in this study employed some aspect of LCT. Policies that incorporate LCT often only focused on greenhouse gas emissions; policies should include other environmental impacts to avoid any environmental tradeoffs and unintended consequences from biofuel production.

Using referenda in a market experiment with externalities, we investigate the effect of trial periods on the acceptability of two theoretically equivalent Pigouvian tax schemes. While implementing either tax is in subjects' material self-interest, we find significant levels of opposition to both schemes, though the level differs considerably. Results show that trial runs can overcome initial tax aversion, which is robust across schemes, but a trial with one scheme does not affect the acceptability of the other. Trial periods also mitigate initial biases in preferences of alternative tax schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This dangerous pollutant is emitted by high temperature combustion and therefore its main source is transportation, which in turn is a consequence of an increase in population and better economic conditions. To examine the determinants of NOx emissions in the Community of Madrid, which is one of the most densely populated regions in Europe, we use an augmented STIRPAT model and a massive dataset which includes kriging estimates of pollution records and integrates various sources of information. Unlike previous research, we carry out our analysis at local level, where the relationship between socio-economic factors and environment becomes more complex, by considering the 179 municipalities of the Community over the period 2000-2009. Our results suggest a positive and statistically significant relationship between private transport-related variables and NOR. Interestingly, the coefficients of the variables related to public transportation are all significant with different signs. The overall outcome illustrates that policy makers should encourage a significant modal shift towards public transport and invest in attractive alternative means of transport and particularly railways in order to reduce transport energy use and mitigate pollutant emissions.

Although the EU-ETS is designed in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner and without prejudice for the Treaty, the system has become a concern issue for firms and industries over competitiveness in European and international markets in addition to carbon leakage. This paper analyses whether and to what extent the EU-ETS may harm competitiveness, by following a qualitative approach, and presenting the case of the Italian paper industry, included in the system as an energy-intensive sector. More specifically, first the paper identifies those key factors that provide a qualitative measure of the competitiveness risk related to the EU-ETS; then, those factors are used to examine the Italian paper industry and to assess the actual and potential risks affecting the sector.

However, new PSAs were banned in Russia even before the advent of state capitalism in the early 2000s. This was, to a large extent, the result of strong anti-PSA lobbying led by the domestic energy business elite. Consequently, Russia's gas policy in the east began evolving from being project-specific toward being region-specific. Contemporary Russian gas policy toward NEA relies upon domestic (national and regional) and external institutions. In 2009, following the completion of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Sakhalin, Russia entered NEA gas markets. Transformations in the international gas markets facilitated the establishment of a two-pattern gas export policy in Russia in 2013. Under this policy, Russia's EU-oriented pipeline gas export remains monopolised by Gazprom, while Asia-oriented LNG export is partially liberalised. Russia has not been experiencing institutional discrepancy in NEA gas markets. However, as the markets evolve toward greater coordination, a rational option for Russia is to genuinely liberalise its gas policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We seek to understand the effects of recent policies such as restructuring of Vehicle Excise Duties and EU standard on new vehicle fuel economy in the UK. In the past few years there have been substantial fluctuations in income and fuel prices, offering an interesting testing ground to understand their impact on the demand for fuel economy in vehicles. We use a monthly dataset to find that the emission standard is the largest driver for fuel economy improvements in recent years. Also, contrary to some recent findings in Europe and in UK we find that income has an effect and that the recession had some role in improving the fuel economy. The effects of fuel prices were relatively small. Restructuring of the VED also improved new vehicle fuel economy in the UK but the scrappage scheme had no significant effect. Results indicate that both supply and demand side policies are effective in improving fuel economy, although quantitatively the emission standard appears more effective due to its stringency. It is also important to consider the effects of income while devising demand side policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It estimates the impact of temperature change on heating and cooling degree days, electricity demand, and generating unit output and efficiency. These effects are then integrated into a dispatch and capacity planning model to estimate impacts on investment decisions, emissions, system costs, and power prices for 32 U.S. regions. Without mitigation actions, total annual electricity production costs in 2050 are projected to increase 14% ($51 billion) because of greater cooling demand as compared to a control scenario without future temperature changes. For a scenario with global emissions mitigation, including a reduction in U.S. power sector emissions of 36% below 2005 levels in 2050, the increase in total annual electricity production costs is approximately the same as the increase in system costs to satisfy the increased demand associated with unmitigated rising temperatures.

To examine the driving forces of China's energy use, this paper conducts a structural decomposition analysis based on hybrid input-output tables. In addition, we describe the framework of China's energy system by using two energy flow charts. The results show that China's current energy use is investment-led demand. Between 1992 and 2007, the three main final-demand categories - gross fixed capital formation, household consumption and exports - contributed approximately one-third each to the changes of total energy use in China. Between 2007 and 2010, however, three-quarters of energy consumption changes came from investment activity only. Technological improvement saved approximately five percent of the total energy use annually during the periods of 1992-1997, 1997-2002 and 2007-2010. In the period of 2002-2007, however, its contribution dropped to only three percent p.a. due to the rise of the indirect energy requirement coefficient in the construction sector. These results suggest that adjusting the final demand structure and improving energy efficiency further will meet China's energy challenges in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Six clusters describing a range from hyper-compact to low-density, dispersed settlements have been identified in the three cities together with the indicators accounting for the highest discrimination among clusters. Low-density and dispersed settlements were more diffused in fragmented (Lisbon) and moderately polycentric (Rome) cities than in mono-centric cities (Athens).

Especially oil is now an economic and a security concern by the Chinese regime and key international stakeholders. Until 2035, China will account for one fourth of the global net growth in global gas consumption and more than half of the net growth in oil consumption. The future demand cannot be covered by China's own conventional and unconventional sources. Pipelines from neighboring countries can cover more than half of the needed import of natural gas by 2030, but only 10 percent of the import demand of oil is secured so far. Even if China attempts to address its insufficient supply of oil by increased investments in overseas oil fields, there is still a large gap. Furthermore, the oil import will largely come from politically unstable countries and regions, and the bulk of the supplies must be shipped through the potentially insecure Hormuz and Malacca Straits. The ongoing territorial disputes with neighboring countries regarding areas with gas and oil reserves in contested waters bear evidence to regional conflict potentials, and China appears to engage more actively in energy diplomacy and regional cooperation.

For counties in the south-central U.S., I find little evidence of an emerging curse from greater natural gas production in the 2000s. Each gas-related mining job created more than one nonmining job, indicating that counties did not become more dependent on mining as measured by employment. Increases in population largely mitigated a rise in earnings per job and crowding out. Furthermore, changes in the adult population by education level reveal that greater production did not lead to a less educated population.

Using the example of distributed solar PV, we analyze the schemes used to encourage/induce owners of distributed assets to make them available for electricity generation. The dominant model in the U.S. is long term power purchase agreements (PPA) offered to owners/consumers by solar developers. We show that these agreements (mis)allocate the electricity price risk to owners/consumers and impose limitations on the scale up of distributed solar. By proper use of financial markets it is possible to shift the electricity price risk from owners/consumers to parties that are better positioned to manage it. The proposed contracts simplify the adoption decision for owners/consumers and can lead to a wider adoption. Removing barriers to scale up requires (i) eliminating the tight coupling between consumers and owners and (ii) rewarding the owners unambiguously for the assets they provide. These necessitate the transformation of the current intermediary firms into full-fledged distributed generators. We discuss the implications of such a transformation and argue that the broad outline of our analysis can be used to assess scale up schemes in other domains of distributed electricity resources as well.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the accuracy of surrogate models for labelling purposes. An ANN was applied to model the building stock of a city in Brazil, based on the results of extensive simulations using the high-resolution building energy simulation program EnergyPlus. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were carried out to evaluate the behaviour of the ANN model, and the variations in the best and worst performance for several typologies were analysed in relation to variations in the input parameters and building characteristics. The results obtained indicate that an ANN can represent the interaction between input and output data for a vast and diverse building stock. Sensitivity analysis showed that no single input parameter can be identified as the main factor responsible for the building energy performance. The uncertainty associated with several parameters plays a major role in assessing building energy performance, together with the facade area and the shell-to-floor ratio. The results of this study may have a profound impact as ANNs could be applied in the future to define regulations in many countries, with positive effects on optimizing the energy consumption.

An inventory is made of the major uses in the Central and Southern North Sea, including the expected development towards 2030. The spatial distribution of non-wind uses is determined as well as the possibilities for differentiation based on density, economic value or nature value and co-existence. These possibilities are translated into calculation rules quantifying the relative importance. These calculation rules have been incorporated in a Decision Support System (DSS) to analyse how the priority of OWE development could impact non-wind uses. In a low OWE priority scenario consequences for other use was found to be very limited, with fisheries and wildlife affected most. In a high OWE priority scenario a considerable amount of OWE may be developed with substantial claims on sand extraction and military use areas and a shift towards higher value categories for shipping and fisheries. Relocation and co-existence of uses are important means to reduce the impact of increased OWE development. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Jongbloed, R. H.; van der Wal, J. T.; Lindeboom, H.

However, unless the parametric likelihood family contains the true likelihood, the estimator is inconsistent due to density misspecification. To correct this bias, we identify an unknown scale parameter 77f that is critical to the identification for consistency and propose a three-step quasi-maximum likelihood procedure with non-Gaussian likelihood functions. This novel approach is consistent and asymptotically normal under weak moment conditions. Moreover, it achieves better efficiency than the Gaussian alternative, particularly when the innovation error has heavy tails. We also summarize and compare the values of the scale parameter and the asymptotic efficiency for estimators based on different choices of likelihood functions with an increasing level of heaviness in the innovation tails. Numerical studies confirm the advantages of the proposed approach.","[Fan, Jianqing; Qi, Lei] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Xiu, Dacheng] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Princeton University; University of Chicago,"Fan, JQ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",jqfan@princeton.edu; lqi@princeton.edu; dacheng.xiu@chicagobooth.edu,"Fan, Jianqing/B-2115-2008",,"NSF [DMS-0704337, DMS-1206464]; University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1206464] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Chicago Booth School of Business(University of Chicago); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We are grateful for helpful suggestions from the editor, the associated editor and the referees, extensive discussions with Chris Sims and Enrique Sentana, and thoughtful comments from seminar and conference participants at Princeton University, the 4th CIREQ Time Series Conference, and the 10th World Congress of the Econometric Society.

Using a geocoded dataset on employment and wages in the city areas of Sweden, the analysis is based on squares representing neighborhoods (, districts (, and agglomerations (. The wage-density elasticity depends on spatial resolution, with the elasticity being highest in neighborhood squares, where a doubling of density is associated with wage increases of 1.2 %, or roughly the size of the elasticity for region density. Moving from a mean-density neighborhood to the densest neighborhood would on average increase wages by 9 %. The results are consistent with (i) the existence of a localized density spillover effect and (ii) quite sharp attenuation of human capital spillovers. An implication of the findings is that if the data source is not sufficiently disaggregated, analyses of the density-wage link risk understating the benefits of working in dense parts of regions, such as the central business districts.","Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ CEnSE, Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Larsson, JP (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ CEnSE, Jonkoping, Sweden.",johan.p.larsson@jibs.hj.se,,"Larsson, Johan P./0000-0001-7432-7442",,,,,31,27,27,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The importance of a retail trade industry to the economy of a rural place depends on its market area. Since those market areas often extend into a place's hinterlands, retail trade can effectively have an export component for the place itself. Yet empirical determination of the export role of a rural retail trade industry has been historically confounded by data limitations which limit testing for and identification of an industry's market area. Using geographic information system tools to define variables for differing driving distances (as contrasted with circles defined by Euclidean distance) from a place, this paper tests for the market areas of seven retail trade industries in rural places and for the impact of retail trade in hinterlands on those market areas. This paper contributes to the relevant literature in three ways. First, it tests formally for a retail industry's market area driving time. Prior articles which have incorporated distance into their analyses have not generally tested for the actual travel times more appropriate for such analyses. Second, it finds that not undertaking such testing might produce misleading results regarding the relationship between a place and the hinterlands in its market areas. Third, the regression results suggest subtlety in the export nature of rural retail trade, with some industries losing their export nature when competing businesses appear in hinterlands (Weak Export Retail industries) and other industries retaining their export nature under those circumstances (Strong Export Retail industries).","[Mushinski, David; Weiler, Stephan] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Widner, Benjamin] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Econ Appl Stat & Int Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",Colorado State University; New Mexico State University,"Mushinski, D (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",david.mushinski@colostate.edu; stephan.weiler@colostate.edu; bwidner@nmsu.edu,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the attractiveness and efficiency of the public financing programme DOCUP 2000-2006 (Documento Unico di Programmazione) in the Piedmont region of Italy. The dataset consists of 1235 firms that applied for public funding to Finpiemonte S.p.A. First, the determinants that lead firms to apply for public funding are examined. It is found that leveraged firms are more likely to ask for public subsidies. What drives Finpiemonte in selecting the firms to be subsidized is then analysed. Results for Measure 2.1b point to lower levels of firm leverage, lower costs and a higher life cycle of the projects to be financed. If the grant scheme under Measure 2.6b is considered, the selection process seems to be influenced by firm profitability. Finally, the efficacy of the programme on firm performance in the years following the granting of the subsidy is estimated. It is found that subsidized firms show an increase of indebtedness and of total fixed assets, while there is no evidence of any impact on firm profitability.","[Cannone, Giusy; Ughetto, Elisa] Politecn Torino, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Cannone, G (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Corso Duca Abruzzi, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",giusy.cannone@polito.it; elisa.ughetto@polito.it,"Ughetto, Elisa/C-9313-2018","Ughetto, Elisa/0000-0002-6019-1051",,,,,39,20,22,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

When it comes to Poland, legal and environmental factors are of special importance, as they might significantly impact the exploitation of both tight gas and shale gas. Exploitation of unconventional gas deposits, because of the technology needed for opening of these deposits, has relatively great impact on the balance sheet and the quality of water. Polish water resources are limited and depend on time and local circumstances. Therefore, obtaining adequate amounts of water needed to hydraulic fracturing of unconventional gas reservoirs may cause some problems. Another problem is return water management. Injection of contaminated water into the rockmass on a large scale seems to be impossible in Poland. Water discharge to surface waters, which seems to be the most probable solution, would result in deterioration of the purity of Polish rivers. Around 32% of Poland is covered by different forms of protection, which might include limitations in exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits (depending on the type of area). Exploration, documentation and exploitation of unconventional gas in Poland is regulated mainly by the laws and regulations regulating geological and mining activities, environmental protection and waste management.

The big four accounting firms have offices in Lagos State. The research instrument used is the questionnaire. The data collected was analyzed using chi-square. It was discovered that family responsibilities do not affect career advancement of male and female accountants. Also, the findings revealed that gender does not influence the access of accountants to opportunities within the job. Finally, it was deduced that gender influences the choice of continuity of accountants in the professional practice of accounting.

To this end, we allow the individual unconditional variances in conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (CC-GARCH) models to change smoothly over time by incorporating a nonstationary component in the variance equations such as the spline-GARCH model and the time-varying (TV)-GARCH model. The variance equations combine the long-run and the short-run dynamic behavior of the volatilities. The structure of the conditional correlation matrix is assumed to be either time independent or to vary over time. We apply our model to pairs of seven daily stock returns belonging to the S&P 500 composite index and traded at the New York Stock Exchange. The results suggest that accounting for deterministic changes in the unconditional variances improves the fit of the multivariate CC-GARCH models to the data. The effect of careful specification of the variance equations on the estimated correlations is variable: in some cases rather small, in others more discernible. We also show empirically that the CC-GARCH models with time-varying unconditional variances using the TV-GARCH model outperform the other models under study in terms of out-of-sample forecasting performance. In addition, we find that portfolio volatility-timing strategies based on time-varying unconditional variances often outperform the unmodeled long-run variances strategy out-of-sample. As a by-product, we generalize news impact surfaces to the situation in which both the GARCH equations and the conditional correlations contain a deterministic component that is a function of time.","[Amado, Cristina; Terasvirta, Timo] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark; [Amado, Cristina] Univ Minho, Nucleo Invest Polit Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Aarhus University; CREATES; Universidade do Minho,"Amado, C (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark.",camado@eeg.umingo.pt; tterasvirta@econ.au.dk,"Terasvirta, Timo/J-1621-2019; Amado, Cristina/B-9811-2009","Terasvirta, Timo/0000-0002-0947-2114; Amado, Cristina/0000-0003-2173-7856",CREATES-Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series; Danish National Research Foundation,CREATES-Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"This work has been supported by CREATES-Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (DNRF78), funded by the Danish National Research Foundation.

In a center of research there are 5 types of active labour market policy programmes (training, employment incentives, supported employment and rehabilitation, direct job creation, start-up incentives). For the effect estimate linked to the relative expenditures on those programmes on the unemployment rate development a generalized method of moments has been used where the lagged explanatory variables are applied as the instrumental variables. To investigate the economic crisis effect a dummy variable has been introduced. The analysis results prove that in the pre-crisis period the unemployment decreased mainly as a result of employment incentives but during the crisis an efficiency of this tool fell but training and direct job creation are added.","[Hanclova, Jana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic; [Simek, Milan] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Natl Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Hanclová, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",jana.hanclova@vsb.cz; milan.simek@vsb.cz,"Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020; Hanclova, Jana/D-7723-2013; Šimek, Milan/I-6323-2018","Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852; Šimek, Milan/0000-0002-7566-8764",,,,,15,2,2,1,11,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,257.0,262,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900045,0

The IEM aimed at third party access and unbundling, neglecting the physical infrastructure and the basis for asset valuations and hence the harmonisation of network charges. The Commission plans to complete the IEM by 2014 almost a quarter of a century after embarking on the policy. Yet even if all the IEM directives are implemented, the EU will remain far from a single competitive market. The CCP was grounded on short term targets (the 2020-20-20 programme) on the assumption that fossil fuel prices would rise, making renewables competitive, and hence yielding a competitive advantage to the EU. The EUETS was intended to lead the way to a global trading system and an international agreement at Copenhagen. The EU has reduced the production of carbon emissions; but only as a result of de-industrialisation and slow growth, and at the expense of rising carbon consumption. Renewables have not led to green growth, but rather to a further eroding of competitiveness. The EUETS price has collapsed. In order for the EU to put the IEM and the CCP back on track, both need to be radically reconsidered. The IEM requires a refocusing on physical infrastructure, common accounting rules and an EU-wide approach to capacity markets and renewables trading. The CCP requires a refocusing on carbon consumption, on limiting the dash-for-coal, and on future rather than current renewables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a more realistic model of viral video diffusion in which every agent that viewed the video shares it once with a random subset of her neighbors. The optimal seeding strategy is then searched with genetic algorithms. The seeding strategy found by the genetic algorithm includes into the initial seed the agents with most connections and lowest clustering ratios; some agents are also selected randomly.

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is the most dominant and widely accepted technique for valuing a broad range of projects and companies. However, the DCF analysis is typically very sensitive to the discount rate, leading to a broad range of valuation estimates. Furthermore, especially for the valuation of early start-ups, the methodology does not properly account for potential company termination. A real options technique called the Matching Cash-Flows (MCF) method was recently developed to value early stage investment projects. The major advantage of the method is that it does not require a discount rate estimate, but rather, relies on the distribution of cash-flow projections to quantify the riskiness of the project or company. Furthermore, the method can properly account for bankruptcy. In this paper, we show how the MCF method can be used effectively, in place of DCF analysis. Two case studies are presented to show the advantage of the methodology.","[Lawryshyn, Yuri; Vinelli, Michael] Univ Toronto, CMTE, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Lawryshyn, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, CMTE, 200 Coll St, Toronto, ON, Canada.",yuri.lawryshyn@utoronto.ca; michael.vinelli@mail.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,PALACKY UNIV OLOMOUC,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,584.0,589,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900101,0

The optimality of capital mobility can be considered by using the consumption-smoothing current account approach: the mobility of capital flows is optimal when it allows for full consumption smoothing over time through the dynamics of the current account in the face of shocks to domestic output, investment, and government expenditure. The consumption-smoothing approach is based on comparing consumption-smoothing part of current account and optimal current account constructed by the help of expected increments of net foreign assets constructed on the base of relevant VAR model formulation. An application to the Czech Republic and Slovakia is performed finding that none of both countries exhibit an optimal level of capital mobility.","Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pánková, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",pankova@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,743.0,747,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900128,0

The discriminant analyses indicated that the sparkling wines treated with PCP2 showed the highest differences in the volatile composition of both sparkling wines studied, being the ethyl esters, terpenes, decanoic acid and some alcohols, the compounds that were affected in a greater extent.

The most important are usually the following five: retirement, buying a house, bringing up children, funding their education and leaving a bequest. These goals are characterized by different realization terms and magnitudes. Most households would not be able to afford financing them without previous saving and investing some part of their income (prefinancing). There are also such goals that just cannot be financed in any other way than prefinancing (e.g., retirement - no possibility of postfinancing with a credit). There arises a need of finding an optimal set of investment programs along with information which program is destined to cover which financial goal. In the article a method of facilitating life-long financial planning for a household is proposed. It allows to find the optimal match between systematic investment plans (SIP) with the same level of risk and multiple financial goals. The choice of portfolios of systematic investment plans is multi-criteria optimization with a number of constraints. At least for expected values of all stochastic factors, household financial liquidity should be preserved in all periods. The plan should also allow for accomplishment of all financial goals set by the household members. The main criterion is minimization of cost for each possible combination of goals and available investment programs. But the resulting life-long cumulated surplus trajectory should also suit other preferences of the household, like their life-length risk aversion. This is why for sets of financial programs chosen in one step of the optimization procedure, a goal function based on expected discounted utilities is maximized in one of the next steps. The result is a set of systematic investment plans with accompanying information which programs are destined to cover which financial goal.","[Pietrzyk, Radoslaw; Rokita, Pawel] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investments & Risk Management, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Pietrzyk, R (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investments & Risk Management, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",radoslaw.pietrzyk@ue.wroc.pl; pawel.rokita@ue.wroc.pl,"Pietrzyk, Radoslaw/S-2267-2016; Rokita, Pawel A./U-1101-2018","Pietrzyk, Radoslaw/0000-0002-6583-8424;",,,,,9,2,2,0,10,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,795.0,800,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900137,0

It is always very imperative to research on ways to mitigate sources of global warming to ensure sustainable growth. Metal processing chain, conversion of raw materials to finished products, is attributed to a significant portion of contributor to CO2 emission and a major industrial consumer of energy. Aluminium, the focus metal type in this paper, is almost fully recyclable due to its very low oxidizing capability. This paper proposes approaches to reduce CO2 emission and energy consumption for sustainable manufacturing growth and more holistic economic development to enhance global competitiveness, in term of world's resources.

Varying approaches to energy generation at the community scale provide interesting insights into the impact of policy innovation as well as the capacity of national energy frameworks to foster socially. innovative engagement practices beyond the purely technological diffusion of innovations. By examining interactions between technological and social innovations with the help of a qualitative analysis, opportunities for potential generators not traditionally engaged in energy generation to tap into these innovation systems are analysed. This paper suggests that greater commitment to diversification beyond the implementation of policy measures such as the feed-in tariff is required to provide communities with the capacity to develop new generation practices in terms of scale and ownership. The UK in particular is struggling to protect these new generation practices which allow communities to derive benefits facilitated by specific energy policy measures according to their potential. It concludes by indicating areas where niche protection might need to be expanded if community energy is to play a greater role in the UK's ambitious transition to a low-carbon economy.

While demand response resources are technically capable of providing these services, current experience across the U.S. illustrates they are relatively minor players in most regions. Accessing demand response resources for ancillary services may require a number of changes to policies and common practices at multiple levels. Regional reliability councils must first define ancillary services such that demand response resources may provide them. Once the opportunity exists, balancing authorities define and promulgate rules that set the infrastructure investments and performance attributes of a resource wishing to provide such services. These rules also dictate expected revenue streams which reveal the cost effectiveness of these resources. The regulatory compact between utility and state regulators, along with other statutes and decisions by state policymakers, may impact the interest of demand response program providers to pursue these resources as ancillary service providers. This paper identifies within these broad categories specific market and policy barriers to demand response providing ancillary services in different wholesale and retail environments, with emphasis on smaller customers who must be aggregated through a program provider to meet minimum size requirements for wholesale transactions.

The results show that under a highly optimistic renewable portfolio standard (RPS) of 80%, fossil fuel consumption in 2050 would be reduced from 4660 Pi to 306 PJ, and the GHG emissions would decrease from 489 million tons to 27 million tons. Nevertheless, price of the electricity generation will increase significantly from US$ 47/MWh under current circumstances (in the base case) to US$ 86/MWh under RPS80. However the effects on import dependency, energy-mix diversity, per unit price of electricity generation and cost of imported fuels indicate that, it may not be desirable to go beyond RPS50. Under RPS50 in 2050, fuel consumption of the power sector would reduce from 21% under the base case to 9% of total fossil fuels supplied to the country.

This study focuses on attempts to develop wind power in an archipelago setting, at Ut6 in Sweden. It has been argued that the development of Swedish wind power slowed during the 1990s; by revisiting the early days of wind power, looking at resistance and support, and connecting success factors, this can be further investigated. Whereas earlier research pointed out institutional conditions and site-specific conditions as crucial for successful wind power development and acceptance, the picture can be made more complete by discussing how wind power projects are affected by time-specific historical conditions. In the case of Uto, these can partly be associated with a newly launched political support program that gave the project political legitimacy and added a pioneering spirit to the endeavor. Conversely, when wind power is not seen as pioneering or experimental any more, but as a mere industrial activity, other incentives may need to be offered to municipalities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015) has set clear targets on installed capacities of different renewable energy technologies. This study aimed to assess the possible contribution of 12th Five Year Plan for China's future energy system and identify factors that might influence its impacts. First, current status of renewable energy development in China has been reviewed. Then several energy scenarios have been developed in an hourly simulation using an energy system analysis tool EnergyPLAN. It was identified that existing grid bottleneck would greatly reduce the potential contribution of renewable installations in terms of share of renewable electricity generation, share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy and system CO2 emissions. In contrast, improving technical performance of renewable energy technologies and sectoral energy efficiency plays an important role in increasing the share of renewables and promoting China's energy system transition. Finally, some policy suggestions were drawn to facilitate a better implementation of the renewable energy plan.

Changes in industrial CO2 emissions from 1991 to 2009 may be studied by quantifying the contributions from changes in five different factors: overall industrial activity (activity effect), industrial activity mix (structure effect), sectoral energy intensity (intensity effect), sectoral energy mix (energy-mix effect) and CO2 emission factors (emission-factor effect). The results indicate that the structure effect and intensity effect played roles in reducing GHG emissions, and the structure effect played a bigger role than the intensity effect. The energy-mix effect increased GHG emissions, and the emission-factor effect decreased GHG emissions. The time series analysis indicates that the GHG emission pattern was changed before and after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regime in Korea. The structure effect and the intensity effect had contributed more in emission reductions after rather than before the IMF regime in Korea. The structure effect and intensity effect have been stimulated since the high oil price period after 2001. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores how a market might be developed for the refurbishment activities assumed in these scenarios, taking the existing market for repair, maintenance and improvement (RMI) as its starting point. Interviews with 16 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry reveal the interdependence of products, practices and processes in housing renovation activities. Conservative practice as well as innovation can be understood as the outcome of multilateral influences on firms from other firms, clients, the material buildings and products in their working lives, and from regulations and regulators. Contractors' openness to innovation is contingent on an informal approach to risk assessment, taking account of cost, time efficiency, client demands, and installer confidence in the reliability of the resulting work. The implications of the research are discussed in relation to the need for new practices and processes on refurbishment projects, raising questions for future research on key questions of quality assurance, performance over time, the application of standards, and vocational training.

Typically policy is informed by forward-looking analysis of potential for alternative energy technologies. But historical knowledge of energy and processing requirements and greenhouse effects is more reliable for engineering evaluation of biofuel production systems. This study calculates energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions for the most efficient biomass feedstocks in New Zealand if the policy had been implemented to maximize liquid biofuel production in the year 2004/2005. The study uses existing processing technologies and agricultural statistics. Bioethanol production is calculated from putrescible wastes and starch crops, and biodiesel production from rapeseed, tallow, wood and waste paper. Each production system is further evaluated using measures of land use, energy input, crop production related to the energy product, plus relative measures of efficiency and renewability. The research findings are that maximum biofuel production in 2004/2005 would have provided only a few per cent of demand, and would not have reduced dependence on foreign imported oil or exposure to fuel price rise. Finally, we conclude that demand management and efficiency are more effective means of meeting policy objectives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that while there was a drop in support for expanded drilling (from 66% in 2008 to 59% in 2010) the change was not significant. There was, however, a significant decrease in support for offshore drilling among coastal residents. There was a slight, non-significant increase in support for offshore wind development which remained significantly higher than support for offshore oil (80% in 2008 and 82% in 2010). Despite there being no significant change in overall support levels, there was a shift in the strength of feeling regarding offshore oil, with 80% of Americans either less supportive or more opposed to expanded drilling in 2010 than they were in 2008.

A field trial is presented, which monitored occupant energy use and provided individual feedback to 83 office workers in a university. The trial comprised pre-and post-intervention surveys, energy measurement and provision of feedback for 18 weeks post-baseline, and two participant focus groups. The main findings were: statistically significant energy reduction was found, but not for the entire measurement period; engagement with feedback diminished over time; no measured individual variables were related to energy reduction and only attitudes to energy conservation were related to energy use; an absence of motivation to undertake energy reduction actions was in evidence.

This research analyzes the evolution of inequality in CO2 emissions per capita in the European Union (EU-27) in the period 1990-2009 and its explanatory factors. For this purpose, we decompose the Theil index of inequality into the contributions of the different Kaya factors. The decomposition is also applied to the inequality between and within groups of countries (North Europe, South Europe, and East Europe). The analysis shows an important reduction in inequality, to a large extent due to the smaller differences between groups and because of the lower contribution of the energy intensity factor. The importance of the GDP per capita factor increases and becomes the main explanatory factor. However, within the different groups of countries the carbonization index appears to be the most relevant factor in explaining inequalities. The policy implications of the results are discussed.

This paper reviews the state of GHG emissions forecasting methods for project-level development. We argue that when forecasting changes in regional emissions it is important to make explicit what is assumed about a project's effect on the population of residents and businesses in the region. We present five regional growth assumptions capturing the range of ways that project-level development might influence (i) construction and occupancy of similar developments elsewhere in a region and (ii) relocation of the initial activities that occur on-site before the project is built. We show that current forecasting tools inconsistently address the latter when they are interpreted as forecasted changes in regional emissions. Using a case study in Yolo County, California we demonstrate that forecasted changes in regional emissions are greatly affected by the regional growth assumption. In the absence of information about which regional growth assumption is accurate, we provide guidelines for selection of a conservative regional growth assumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The U.S. National Park Service has committed to quantifying and reducing scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 35% and scope 3 emissions by 10% by 2020 for all parks. Current inventories however do not provide the specificity or granularity to evaluate solutions that address fundamental inefficiencies in these inventories. By quantifying and comparing the importance of different inventory sectors as well as upstream and downstream emissions in Yosemite National Park (YNP), this carbon footprint provides a case study and potential template for quantifying future emissions reductions, and for evaluating tradeoffs between them. Results indicate that visitor-related emissions comprise the largest fraction of the Yosemite carbon footprint, and that increases in annual visitation (3.43-3.90 million) coincide with and likely drive interannual increases in the magnitude of Yosemite's extended inventory (126,000-130,000 t CO(2)e). Given this, it is recommended that per visitor efficiency be used as a metric to track progress.

An integrated life cycle framework to evaluate energy systems investment tradeoffs,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Oil sands; Life cycle assessment; Cost-benefit analysis,CARBON,"The inclusion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions costs in energy systems investment decision-making requires the development of a framework that accounts for GHG and economic tradeoffs. This paper develops such a framework by integrating partial cost-benefit analysis with life cycle assessment to explore the question of whether bitumen should be upgraded in the Canadian province of Alberta to produce synthetic crude oil (SCO), or blended with light hydrocarbons to produce lower-quality diluted bitumen (dilbit). The net present value (NPV) of these options is calculated from the stakeholder perspectives of the oil sands industry, the Alberta public, and a climate-concerned Alberta resident. This calculation includes monetized GHG emissions costs stemming from a hypothetical economy-wide GHG price, and a sensitivity analysis explores the effects of variations in technical and economic conditions on stakeholders' preferences. We find that under most plausible sets of conditions, industry would prefer the dilution option, while the climate-concerned Alberta resident would prefer the upgrading option. In contrast, the preferences of the general Alberta public depend on the values of key variables (e.g., the SCO-dilbit price differential). Key drivers of differences among stakeholders' preferences include different perceptions of risks and responsibilities for life cycle GHG emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Given its importance in policy debates, we have sought to explore the specification and measurement of diversity. We show that although conceptualisation of diversity has developed over recent years, along with increasingly elegant mathematical representations, the concept is, at core, subjective and irreducibly context specific. Subjectivity derives from determination of boundaries and the placement of objects into categories, the acts that make assessment of diversity possible. We illustrate this point with an empirical analysis of the diversity of renewable energy generation in the UK over the past century. By applying a range of different indices and classifications to this dataset, we demonstrate that the 'diversity story' told is different in each case. As such we argue that the analysis of diversity must be produced and consumed critically. Attempts to expand, manage, measure or comment upon the diversity of a system, be it an ecosystem, an organization, an economy, or an energy portfolio, demand rigor, reflexivity and, most importantly, transparency.

The Bangladesh Rural Electrification Program (BREP) has been highlighted as a positive case among developing countries, but from 2006 onwards there have been doubts about the program's chances of success. In this paper, we examine the rural electrification practices in Bangladesh and evaluate the claim that, whereas they were successful up to 2005, they then began to decline in terms of their performance. This study determines the factors behind the initial success of the program as well as those that account for the recent downturn in BREP. We found that the BREP was a clear success in terms of its growth and progress; however, its performance has been declining since 2006. The key driving factors for the success of this program had to do with prioritizing system investment, community involvement, anti-corruption features, standardized practices and performance-based incentives while excluding political parties. The major issues accounting for the decline were the lack of organizational autonomy, a shortage of funding, unrealistic tariffs, and power supply shortages. Renewable-based, off-grid technologies have been successfully supplementing the on-grid program in remote areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A focus on methods,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity savings; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 intensity,ENERGY EFFICIENCY; POWER-GENERATION; NUCLEAR-POWER; WIND POWER; ABATEMENT; STANDARD; COSTS,"In this paper we evaluate two approaches for estimating CO2 emission reduction from electricity savings: one based on average CO2 intensities of electricity generation and another that relies on marginal CO2 intensities. It is found that the average CO2 intensity approach has a significant shortcoming when it comes to scenario-based approaches for CO2 emission reduction. This shortcoming lies in the chicken-egg problem created, where larger future electricity savings are actually big enough to change the CO2 intensity in such a way that it cannot be used anymore to estimate the CO2 emission reduction. We show that in these cases the marginal approach is preferred. To correctly apply this approach, it is important to determine the CO2 intensity of the future power mix which will not be built in order to avoid under or overestimation of the CO2 savings calculated. We propose a seven-step approach which can be used in scenario-based potential studies as guidance for estimating the CO2 emission reductions from not only electricity savings but also renewable electricity and mitigation options that consume electricity such as electric cars and heat pumps. Using our approach would avoid a disconnection of the CO2 reduction potential with the underlying reference scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, high capture costs reduce profitability. This paper investigates carbon price uncertainty and technological uncertainty through a real option approach. We compare the cases of early and delayed CCS deployments. An early technological progress may arise from aggressive R&D and pilot project programs, but the expected cost reduction remains uncertain. We show that this approach results in lower emissions and more rapid investment returns although these returns will not fully materialise until after 2030. In a second set of simulations, we apply an incentive that prioritises sequestered emissions rather than avoided emissions. In other words, this economic instrument does not account for CO2 emissions from the CCS implementation itself, but rewards all the sequestered emissions. In contrast with technological innovations, this subsidy is certain for the investor. The resulting investment level is higher, and the project may become profitable before 2030. Negative emission in bioethanol production does not seem to be a short-term solution in our framework, whatever the carbon price drift. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The second strategy regresses the present expenditures on last year's expenditures over several subsamples. Both empirical strategies lead to the following conclusions.

The study covers power generation, petroleum refining, iron and steel, and cement production. By simulating capital stock turnover, scenarios that assume future developments in the technology stock, energy intensities, fuel and production mixes, and the resulting CO2 emissions were generated for each sector. The results confirm that the EU goal for reductions in Greenhouse Gas Emission in the sectors covered by the EU Emission Trading System, i.e., 21% reduction by 2020 as compared to the levels in 2005, is attainable with the abatement measures that are already available. However, despite the optimism regarding the potential for, and implementation of, available abatement strategies within current production processes, our results indicate that the power and industrial sectors will fail to comply. with more stringent reduction targets in both the medium term (2030) and long term (2050).

This paper attempts to estimate the economic value of LNG in Korea's manufacturing sector by employing the concept of the value of marginal product (VMP). For this, we used data on 328 firms using LNG as an input. Two types of production functions (the Cobb-Douglas and trans-log functions) are applied. The result of the specification test indicates that the trans-log function is more appropriate for estimating the data. The output elasticity and VMP of industrial LNG are estimated to be 0.1346 and KRW 6844 (USD 6.22) per m(3), respectively. The results have important implications for various areas of industrial LNG management. For example, any cost-benefit analysis of new projects providing industrial LNG requires information on the economic value of industrial LNG.

Direct rebound effects result from increased demand for cheaper energy services, while indirect rebound effects result from increased demand for other goods and services that also require energy to provide. Research to date has focused upon the former, but both are important for climate change. This study estimates the combined direct and indirect rebound effects from seven measures that improve the energy efficiency of UK dwellings. The methodology is based upon estimates of the income elasticity and greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of 16 categories of household goods and services, and allows for the embodied emissions of the energy efficiency measures themselves, as well as the capital cost of the measures. Rebound effects are measured in GHG terms and relate to the adoption of these measures by an average UK household. The study finds that the rebound effects from these measures are typically in the range 5-15% and arise mostly from indirect effects. This is largely because expenditure on gas and electricity is more GHG-intensive than expenditure on other goods and services. However, the anticipated shift towards a low carbon electricity system in the UK may lead to much larger rebound effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that women are less confident in their entrepreneurial skills, have different social networks and exhibit higher fear of failure than men. After controlling for endogeneity, we find that these variables explain a substantial part of the gender gap in entrepreneurial activity. Although, of course, their relative importance varies significantly across countries, these factors appear to have a universal effect.","[Koellinger, Philipp] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Minniti, Maria] So Methodist Univ, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Schade, Christian] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Inst Entrepreneurship & Innovat Management, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Southern Methodist University; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Koellinger, P (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",koellinger@ese.eur.nl; mminniti@cox.smu.edu; cds@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,,"Koellinger, Philipp/0000-0001-7413-0412",,,,,49,183,213,8,89,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The results seem to reject the efficient market hypothesis in the market. Moreover, by applying Granger-causality tests, this paper investigates whether the power price is determined from the information of primary energy and exchange markets that directly affect the cost of power generation. The results indicate no Granger-causality from the prices of oil and gas and the exchange rate to the price of electricity.

Thirty percent of bioethanol is produced from sugar beets in the EU. However, sugar beet cultivated area and yields have fallen due to the 2006 sugar regime reform. Given the potential uncertainty about the future for sugar beet farmers, biofuels may represent an alternative market. This paper analyses potential contribution to the efficiency, in terms of environmental output, of the sugar beet crop both when production is oriented toward bioethanol and regarding the use of input. An empirical application is performed in Spain by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The results show that 4% of farms have full technical efficiency, while the rest have an average efficiency of 55.9%. The figures show that inputs can be reduced over 40%, and also show the low average level of input-use efficiency. In addition, it cannot be said that there is a relationship between efficiency and farm scale. The consideration of aspects such as the environmental advantages of using sugar beet production for bioethanol can open new lines of action to support this crop in the EU. In addition, boosting sugar beet production may reduce potential dependency on importation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data on voting at the 2007 federal election and from the 2006 census, the paper shows that patterns of voter support for political parties have a distinct geography across Australia's cities and regions. Spatial and statistical modelling is used to derive spatial typologies of voter support for political parties and to identify key demographic and socio-economic factors that discriminate voter support for political parties. Clear socio-political landscapes are evident. The position of political parties in a two-dimensional socio-political space has changed over the last three federal elections, the first two of which in 2001 and 2004 saw the Coalition Government returned with strong majorities, while the third election in 2007 saw a marked voter swing to oust the Coalition parties and put the Labor Party into government.","[Stimson, Robert John] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Shyy, Tung-Kai] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Queensland,"Stimson, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",rstimson@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Seeing the outer suburbs: addressing the urban bias in creative place thinking, Regional Studies. This paper draws upon quantitative and qualitative research into Australian cities to question the assumption that creative industries workers inherently seek to cluster in inner-urban areas. It challenges this foundational assumption by combining a critical application of the location quotient analysis of major Australian cities with qualitative research drawn from interviews with creative workers based in suburban Melbourne and Brisbane. The findings provide analyses as to why many creative industries workers prefer to locate themselves in outer suburban places. There is also discussion of the implications of these findings for future work on the cultural geography and policies of creative industries.","[Collis, Christy; Flew, Terry] Queensland Univ Technol, Creat Ind Fac, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Freebody, Simon] Queensland Univ Technol, ARC Ctr Excellence Creat Ind & Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Collis, C (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Creat Ind Fac, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",c.collis@qut.edu.au; s.freebody@qut.edu.au; t.flew@qut.edu.au,"Flew, Terry/I-9738-2012","Flew, Terry/0000-0003-4485-9338; Collis, Christy/0000-0003-2951-8412",,,,,73,17,19,1,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

From an integrated social acceptance and customer-perceived value theory perspective we model the importance of customer value of smart metering in this regard. We further shape the model on a choice-based conjoint experiment with Swiss private electricity customers. The study finds that overall customers perceive a positive value from smart metering and are willing to pay for it. Further, based on a cluster analysis of customers' value perceptions, we identify four customer segments, each with a distinct value perception profile for smart metering. We find that energy policy and management should integrate a solid understanding of customer value for smart metering in their initiatives and consider different smart metering market segments within their measures.

In this. survey, a database with more than 400 buildings was created and analyzed. We researched energy consumption by region, building type, building size and vintage, and we determined the total energy use and performed end use breakdowns of typical buildings in six cities in southern China. The statistical analysis shows that, on average, the annual building electricity use ranged from 50 to 100 kWh/m(2) for office buildings, 120 to 250 kWh/m(2) for shopping malls and hotels, and below 40 kW h/m(2) for education facilities. Building size has no direct correlation with building energy intensity. Although modern commercial buildings built in the 1990s and 2000s did not use more energy on average than buildings built previously, the highest electricity intensive modem buildings used much more energy than those built prior to 1990. Commercial buildings in China used less energy than buildings in equivalent weather locations in the US and about the same amount of energy as buildings in India. However, commercial buildings in China provide comparatively less thermal comfort than buildings in comparable US climates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, the coupled space-time attributes of economic phenomena are difficult to be represented and examined. Both GIS and economic geography are faced with the challenges of dealing with the temporal dynamics of geographic processes and spatial dynamics of economic development across scales and dimensions. This paper thus suggests a novel way to generalize the characteristics and the structure of space-time data sets, using regional economic data as the example. Accordingly, a reasonable number of general questions (data analysis tasks) can be abstracted. Then, tools (methods) may be suggested on that basis. The cross-fertilization between exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and spatial economics is also identified and illustrated by the capabilities of these components, which have uncovered some interesting patterns and trends in the spatial income data of China and the United States. Through exploratory analysis of economic data, the detection of rich details of underlying geographical and temporal processes would be the first step toward such cross-fertilization. In addition, this exploratory analytical framework can be applied to other data sets that are also measured for areal units at multiple points in time.","[Ye, Xinyue] Bowling Green State Univ, Ctr Reg Dev, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Ye, Xinyue] Bowling Green State Univ, Sch Earth Environm & Soc, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Rey, Sergio] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ye, XY (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Ctr Reg Dev, 109 South Hall, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",xye@bgsu.edu,"ye, xinyue/A-7677-2011","ye, xinyue/0000-0001-8838-9476; Rey, Sergio/0000-0001-5857-9762",,,,,49,49,82,8,80,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We focus on four main areas that have been identified from empirical research in achieving this objective; these are: (i) financing, (ii) markets; (iii) trade and (iv) policy. The sources utilised consist of primary and secondary data compilation and analysis. Of particular relevance are the results of a market survey undertaken on funding opportunities, where the perspectives of both, project developers as well as project financiers are taken into account. Results indicate that the four areas cannot be treated autonomously, as they not only overlap but impact each other. There are a number of difficulties for biofuel ventures, not least the nature of the projects themselves, but also around the financing and political landscape of these enterprises. Common solutions which cross cut the four areas are the need to raise awareness and the skillsets, in areas including, financing opportunities, markets, policy, technical aspects among a range of stakeholders involved in biofuel ventures. There is also a necessity to create a supporting framework for the emerging carbon trading-related activities in Africa. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to test whether a process could be designed that encouraged individuals - from within their existing social networks - to facilitate energy reduction discussions that ultimately changed the way they consumed energy. Our Energymark process was grounded in the idea that change is facilitated by several supporting factors including the provision of tailored information, social support, encouragement to set goals, and access to feedback. In this paper we report on the first trial with members of the Australian public. By the end of the trial an average emissions reduction of 20% was reported using a pre- and post-trial carbon calculator incorporating the energy used at home, waste, spending on products and services, beef consumption, and transport. While many identified as climate change aware, and had the socio-economic capacity to make changes, we found that participants of widely varying demographics and dispositions responded to program features, achieving equivalent emissions reductions. This bodes well for the program's effectiveness and warrants further testing of the impact of voluntary action with social processes such as Energymark. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulation results show two important consequences of the greenbelt release. First, the greenbelt release would attract more residents and jobs into greenbelt zones and reduce the population and number of firms in both the central city and outer sides of the greenbelt, thereby implying the reduction of inner city densification and of development beyond the greenbelt. Second, both residential and nonresidential space rents would have declined for the whole metropolitan area from 0.4 to 13.7% had the greenbelt been completely released in 2006, thereby indicating that Seoul's greenbelt made a contribution to raising space rents by limiting land supply.","Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Jun, MJ (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",mjjun1@cau.ac.kr,"Jun, Myung-Jin/AAG-9363-2019","Jun, Myung-Jin/0000-0002-4218-3074",,,,,40,20,20,1,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Because low-income homeowners generally hold a larger fraction of their wealth as home equity and are less likely to sustain homeownership, the overall financial position of this population is especially dependent on house price movements during short holding periods and the timing of house purchase and sale. The data used for analysis include zip-code-level house price estimates provided by Fannie Mae and proprietary mortgage origination data for a representative sample of low-income US homeowners who received community reinvestment mortgages between 1998 and 2004. I estimate a series of linear mixed-effects models to predict house price appreciation and the risk premium associated with investment in housing as opposed to a risk-free asset. Controlling for a variety of related factors, including land scarcity and subprime lending activity, I find that land use regulations are associated with greater house price volatility and a greater risk premium for urban low-income households. Thus, the results suggest that the dependence of low-income homeowner wealth on the timing of house purchase and sale is weaker in less regulated markets.","Univ N Carolina, Ctr Community Capital, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Riley, SF (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Ctr Community Capital, 1700 Martin Luther King Blvd,Suite 129,CB 3452, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",sfr@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,29,5,6,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The introduction of nuclear energy in society should be seen as an ongoing social experiment, whose (moral) acceptability should continuously be addressed. Given the long-term risks of nuclear energy, intergenerational justice should be explicitly included in such an analysis. This will also have implications for nuclear power policies. Furthermore, emotions such as sympathy and feelings of responsibility can provide moral insights; they should be taken seriously in the debate about nuclear energy rather than being dismissed as irrational distractions as is currently the case. These proposed reforms would help society to move beyond the usual stalemate in the debate about nuclear power. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The term power quality includes, in general, a set of boundary conditions which allow electrical systems connected to the grid to function as planned. Therefore, the operation of the power system outside these boundaries directly impacts on the economic performance of the whole system. The evaluation of the economical loses derived from this fact has been the subject of several studies, mostly applied to individual cases, with calculation methodologies either too complicated to be applicable, needing a large input of data, mostly dealing with confidentiality issues, or based on particular cases and impossible to extrapolate. The objective of this paper is provide decision makers and authorities responsible of enforcing compensations for losses derived of power quality issues with a relatively easy to apply methodology for calculating the real quantity of these losses. An example of the application of this methodology and an analysis of the results is also provided.

The methodology is built on the newly developed multi-level perspective (MLP) transitions, as well as literature on innovation systems. Three lines of thought on the transition process are integrated to probe the possible transition pathways in China's power sector. Five transition pathways, namely reproduction, transformation, substitution, reconfiguration, de-alignment/re-alignment and reconfiguration, with their possible technology options are presented. The requirements for a smart grid in the socio-technical transition process are addressed within the MLP framework. The paper goes further to propose an interactive framework for low carbon transition management in China. Representative technology options are appraised by employing innovation theory to demonstrate the logic of policy design within the framework. The work presented in this paper will be useful in informing policy-makers and other stakeholders in China and it may prove to be a valuable reference for other countries in energy transition management.

Even when data and tools are intended for public re-use they often come with technical, legal, economic and social barriers that make them difficult to adopt, adapt and combine for use in new contexts. We focus on the promise of open, publically accessible software and data as well as crowdsourcing techniques to develop robust energy analysis tools that can deliver crucial, policy-relevant insight, particularly in developing countries, where planning resources are highly constrained-and the need to adapt these resources and methods to the local context is high. We survey existing research, which argues that these techniques can produce high-quality results, and also explore the potential role that linked, open data can play in both supporting the modelling process and in enhancing public engagement with energy issues.

Credit unions are historically viewed as a community-based strategy designed to fill voids in spatial financial markets. Unlike banks and more traditional retail financial institutions, our results show that credit unions operate in areas with a low concentration of retail banks. This suggests that credit unions do not follow the herd mentality that dominates traditional retail banking institutions. Instead they cluster around common bonds of association. That is credit unions are fundamentally capturing a different market than traditional banks and do not behave in a pro-competitive manner with banks. In the spirit of Bitter et al. (J Geogr Syst 9:7-27, 2007), we compare the overall performance of geographically weighted regression with a set of both spatial and non-spatial estimators. We find that the spatial estimators generally performed better than the aspatial estimators, and there is significant spatial heterogeneity in some of the determinants of credit union concentrations. Results on individual variables of interest tend to be stable across the different estimators lending confidence to our hypothesis that credit unions serve niche markets.","[Deller, Steven; Sundaram-Stukel, Reka] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Deller, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 515 Taylor Hall,427 Lorch St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",scdeller@wisc.edu; rsundara@wisc.edu,"Deller, Steven/I-5238-2015","Deller, Steven/0000-0003-4457-3444",,,,,84,8,12,0,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A clear understanding of energy-induced carbon emissions is therefore necessary for local communities to develop a better carbon emissions management system. We develop an integrated inventory method for energy-induced carbon emissions accounting in local Chinese communities. The method combines scope and sectoral analyses on the basis of local statistical features. As an outcome four core findings are presented: (1) From 2000 to 2009, the energy-induced carbon emissions of Chongming rapidly increased from 1.75 to 4.90 million tons, with the annual growth rate of 12.12%. (2) Emissions from manufacturing, construction, and household sectors accounted for 84.44%; manufacturing is the biggest emitting sector. (3) Carbon emissions from imported electricity reached a historic high of 22.51% in 2009, indicating the necessity of taking the imported carbon emissions into consideration. (4) In 2008, the per capita carbon emissions of Chongming were lower than that of the United States and Shanghai, but higher than that of the global average. Three strategic approaches are proposed: to optimize industrial structure and improve efficiency, reinforce carbon management for the household sector, and enhance carbon statistics.

One of them is the idea that governments are able to achieve sustained high growth. Another one is the believe that the solution to pressing financial and social problems centers on higher growth. It is also questionalble, however, to say that giving up on economic growth as a paradigm is the necessary condition to tackle the environmental crisis. In actuality, solving such problems is about radical growth in environmental and resource-saving technologies. It is also about radical de-growth in products and processes that undermine long-term living and production conditions. This paper describes some best practice cases of green growth and the conceptual generalisations given by the OECD and other established institutions in Europe and Asia.

Due to the price-inelasticity of oil demand the supply shortage leads to a sharp increase in oil prices in the second scenario, with high effects on GDP comparable to the magnitude of the global financial crises in 2008/09. Oil exporting countries benefit from high oil prices, whereas oil importing countries are negatively affected. Generally, the effects in the third scenario are significantly smaller than in the second, showing that energy efficiency measures and the switch to renewable energy sources decreases the countries' dependence on oil imports and hence reduces their vulnerability to oil price shocks on the world market.

Here, we obtain insight into the prospects of future price decline by establishing ex-post learning rates for HEVs and ex-ante price forecasts for HEVs and BEVs. Since 1997, HEVs have shown a robust decline in their price and price differential at learning rates of 7 +/- 2% and 23 +/- 5%, respectively. By 2010, HEVs were only 31 +/- 22 (SIC)(2010) kW(-1) more expensive than conventional cars. Mass-produced BEVs are currently introduced into the market at prices of 479 +/- 171 (SIC)(2010) kW(-1), which is 285 +/- 213 (SIC)(2010) kW(-1) and 316 +/- 209 (SIC)(2010) kW(-1) more expensive than HEVs and conventional cars. Our forecast suggests that price breakeven with these vehicles may only be achieved by 2026 and 2032, when 50 and 80 million BEVs, respectively, would have been produced worldwide. We estimate that BEVs may require until then global learning investments of 100-150 billion E which is less than the global subsidies for fossil fuel consumption paid in 2009. These findings suggest that HEVs, including plug-in HEVs, could become the dominant vehicle technology in the next two decades, while BEVs may require long-term policy support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the immense inequality of regional economic development in China, a comparative analysis of regional economic growth between coastal provinces and interior provinces is also conducted. The results suggest that interior provincial incomes as a system tend to converge, while there is no evidence supporting the convergences of coastal provincial incomes.

Improved stoves have been promoted by development actors since the 1970s to alleviate various environmental and health problems associated with biomass use, with largely disappointing outcomes. Against this background, this paper examines the intervention of an international development organisation - Practical Action in West Kochieng, Kenya, where the organisation's energy poverty alleviation efforts are aimed at addressing the health hazards of biomass smoke with six 'low-cost' improved cooking technologies. The study reveals that the cooking technology most valued by poor West Kochieng households is the one which most reflects their priorities, rather than those expressed by Practical Action. The findings point to three aspects of appropriateness of energy poverty alleviation interventions - technological, economic and cultural - which combine to influence acceptance and uptake of such interventions. The evidence highlights some of the limitations inherent in the generic policy recommendation to 'leapfrog' towards the resolution of energy poverty-related problems, and suggests that more measured steps which respond to the socio-economic realities of poor households are likely to engender more appropriate solutions.

This article estimates the energy consumption for this practice in the United States at 1% of national electricity use, or $6 billion each year. One average kilogram of final product is associated with 4600 kg of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, or that of 3 million average U.S. cars when aggregated across all national production. The practice of indoor cultivation is driven by criminalization, pursuit of security, pest and disease management, and the desire for greater process control and yields. Energy analysts and policymakers have not previously addressed this use of energy. The unchecked growth of electricity demand in this sector confounds energy forecasts and obscures savings from energy efficiency programs and policies. While criminalization has contributed to the substantial energy intensity, legalization would not change the situation materially without ancillary efforts to manage energy use, provide consumer information via labeling, and other measures.

These challenges in turn increase the demand for wind energy development. Along with rapid growth in manufacturing capacity, Chinese companies have aspired to increase their innovation capacity in order to enhance their competitiveness in the market. Joint research and development (R&D) is an attractive path for Chinese companies striving to advance their R&D capacity. This paper examines joint R&D between Chinese wind-turbine manufacturing companies and foreign design firms, assessing the performance of joint R&D activities in China using the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) framework. The study found that joint R&D has improved Chinese companies' technical capacity, human resources and financial growth. However, the effect on Chinese companies' innovation capacity is still limited because of unequal technical capacities of the two sides in collaboration, as well as their preference for augmenting profits rather than technical capacity. Current joint R&D mode is only the extension of licensing mode in wind-turbine manufacturing industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we have tested cointegration relationships using the Johansen bi-variate cointegration model. This is complemented with an analysis of an auto-regressive distributed lag model to examine the results' robustness. Then, the Granger short-run, the long-run and strong causality are tested with a vector error correction modelling framework. The results indicate that uni-directional causality exists from energy consumption to economic growth both in the short and the long-run while a bi-directional long-run causality exists between electricity consumption and economic growth but no causal relationship exists in short-run. The strong causality results indicate bi-directional causality for both the cases. A uni-directional causality runs from energy consumption to CO2 emission for the short-run but feedback causality exists in the long-run. CO2 Granger causes economic growth both in the short and in the long-run. An important policy implication is that energy (electricity as well) can be considered as an important factor for the economic growth in Bangladesh. Moreover, as higher energy consumption also means higher pollution in the long-run, policy makers should stimulate alternative energy sources for meeting up the increasing energy demand.

Our results show that in the long-run energy consumption has a positive significant impact on CO2 emissions. More interestingly, we show that real GDP exhibits a quadratic relationship with CO2 emissions for the region as a whole. However, although the estimated long-run coefficients of income and its square satisfy the EKC hypothesis in most studied countries, the turning points are very low in some cases and very high in other cases, hence providing poor evidence in support of the EKC hypothesis. CO2 emission reductions per capita have been achieved in the MENA region, even while the region exhibited economic growth over the period 1981-2005. The econometric relationships derived in this paper suggest that future reductions in CO2 emissions per capita might be achieved at the same time as GDP per capita in the MENA region continues to grow.

Here, I provide a novel conceptual framework for how firms can assess regulatory risk that focuses on the institutional processes governing policy-making. Risks are lower - and policies will subsequently be more stable - in jurisdictions where regulatory agencies have greater autonomy from politicians and where policies are formulated through more 'rigid' policy-making processes. The contrasting development patterns of renewable energy policies in Ontario and Texas offer support for the framework.

The practice of widening modern energy services access to the poor in Africa is complex, and exacerbated by the dual nature of the energy system across Sub-Saharan Africa where traditional and modern energy systems and practices co-exist. This presents major challenges for policy makers who have to contend with a fragmented energy system, which requires the mobilisation of an array of actors at cross-sectoral levels in order to develop effective institutions and implement innovative policy frameworks. This paper further argues that, the 'energy access' discussion needs to take place in the context of energy transitions, giving due consideration to the productive sector as an important vehicle for change. As the link between energy and development is context specific, each African country needs to chart its own energy transition pathway into the future, and there are ample lessons that they can draw from previous energy transitions.

The recommendations listed in the paper will help to change the existing legislation regarding green electricity by means of eliminating its main drawbacks. The best prospects for renewable electricity production are related to the energy from the wind and the sun, nonetheless energy from the sun and biomass is used mostly for heating purposes, whereas the number of plans for the construction of wind farms and solar plants is growing tremendously. Despite policies and legislation being in place for the inclusion of electricity from renewables in the grid, technical and financial obstacles exist. There are plenty of plans to build new generating facilities, but at the same time there is absolutely no information about the construction of power backup. The existing regulatory policy regarding green electricity production and consumption still has significant potential for improvement. Compared to other measures, feed-in tariff implementation has spurred green electricity production in Ukraine, because feed-in tariff rates are high, and grid access is guaranteed by law, a major advantage of the current legislation on renewables in Ukraine.

This paper forecasts the rate at which EV/PHEV will penetrate into the market in the future and the effects of that spread on CO2 reduction by using a learning curve for lithium-ion batteries, distribution of daily travel distance for each vehicle, and an optimal power generation planning model for charging vehicles. Taking into consideration each driver's economical viewpoint, the speed at which the EV/PHEV share of the new passenger vehicle market grows is fairly slow. The optimum calculation in our base case shows that the share of EV/PHEV is only a quarter even in 2050. However, the initial price and progress rate of batteries have a great effect on this share. Therefore, long-term economic support from the government and significant R&D innovation are required to reduce CO2 drastically through cutting down battery price. The results also show how much the CO2 emission intensity of power generation affects the CO2 reduction rate by introducing EV/PHEV. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on spatial statistics methods, this paper explores the regional imbalance of China's provincial energy intensity and the spatially correlation of energy intensity among provinces. Using spatial panel data models, this paper finds that GDP per capita, transportation infrastructure, the level of marketization, and scientific and technological input significantly reduce the energy intensity; the ratio of heavy industries to total industries and the ratio of coal consumption to total energy consumption significantly expand the energy intensity; meanwhile, the coefficient of the ratio of export to GDP is not significant. Then, the spillover and convergence of China's regional energy intensity have been tested. The results indicate that the spillover effect between the eastern and western China is remarkable, and there exist absolute beta-convergence of provincial energy intensity. Moreover, GDP per capita, transportation infrastructure, the level of marketization and scientific & technological input are conducive to conditional convergence after the spatial effects are controlled. According to the empirical results, this paper proposes some policy suggestions on reducing China's energy intensity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To date CCS technologies are not deployed on a commercial level, and policy instruments should be used to provide incentives to firms to use these technologies to reduce pollution. The aim of this paper is to compare the cost-efficiency of several incentive-based instruments (a fossil fuel tax, an emissions tax, a cap and trade system, and a subsidy on captured emissions) needed to spur the adoption of CCS and BECCS, using a dynamic general equilibrium model. This type of model has become the standard for assessing economy-wide impacts of environmental and technological policies. The study shows that BECCS will be deployed only if a specific subsidy per unit of biomass emissions captured with a CCS technology is available. We show also that the two most cost-efficient instruments for achieving a given emissions reduction target are a specific subsidy that rewards captured emissions and a carbon tax whose revenues are recycled to subsidize BECCS.

In Portugal, despite the fact that the organic effluents are a relevant energy source (873 Mm(3) biogas per year; 4889 GW h yr(-1)) and that new feed-in tariffs were established, biogas valorisation is still at an early stage. The importance of anaerobic digestion was only recognized in 2007 and the present installed power is about 10% of the potential electrical power (229 MW). Therefore, it is desirable to strengthen the national and regional biogas market. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Already today, VRE's power contribution is at times close to the total demand in some regions with severe consequences for the remainder of the power system. Grid extensions are necessary for the physical integration of VRE, i.e., for power transports, but they also have important economic consequences for all power system participants. We employ a regional, power system model to examine the role of grid extensions for the market effects of VRE in Europe. We derive cost-optimal macroscopic transmission grid extensions for the projected wind and solar capacities in Europe in 2020 and characterize their effects on the power system with high regional and technological resolution. Without grid extensions, lower electricity prices, new price dynamics and reduced full load hours for conventional generation technologies result in proximity to high VRE capacities. This leads to substantial changes in the projected achievable revenues of utilities. Grid extensions partially alleviate and redistribute these effects, mainly for the benefit of baseload and the VRE technologies themselves. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Life after regions? The evolution of city-regionalism in England, Regional Studies. This paper examines the evolving pattern of city-regional governance in England. Following the demise of English regional policy in 2004, city-regions have come to represent the in vogue spatial scale amongst policy elites. The result has been a proliferation of actual and proposed policies and institutions designed to operate at a, variously defined, city-regional scale in England. Nevertheless, attempts to build a city-regional tier of governance have been tentative and lacking coherence. Alongside this, city-regions are to be found emerging alongside existing tiers of economic governance and spatial planning. Arguing that what is being witnessed is not 'life after regions' but life with, or alongside, regions, the analysis presented argues that to understand why contemporary state reorganization results in a multiplication of the scales of economic governance and spatial planning, it must be recognized how the state shapes policies in such a way as to protect its legitimacy in maintaining regulatory control and management of the economy. The final section relates these findings to wider debates on state rescaling and speculates on the future role of transition models in sociospatial theory.","Univ Loughborough, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Harrison, J (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",j.harrison4@lboro.ac.uk,"Harrison, John/D-1485-2010","Harrison, John/0000-0002-6434-5142",,,,,81,78,79,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This study shows that, in a case like Brazil's, a two-part tariff may be used as a tool for network optimization.

These aspects are: (1) the use of advanced producer services (APS) office locations as a proxy for inter-city relations, (2) the problematic calculation of the functional polycentricity index, and (3) the narrow conceptualization of functional polycentricity. Alternative methodologies based on transaction link data are introduced to examine whether Central Belgium displays features of a functionally polycentric mega-city-region. The results suggest that this is not the case: Central Belgium displays more features of a hierarchical urban system with Brussels as the dominant service city.

In response to disputes about China's electricity market reform, this paper analyses the efficiency of China's coal-fired power plants using the Data Envelopment Analysis Slack Based Measure (DEA-SBM) method on three levels: groups, provinces, and plants. The results indicate that there are both coal-electricity efficiency disparities and generation-hour arrangement unfairness across groups; the disparity across provinces is obvious and long-lasting, as indicated by capacity surpluses and coal-electricity efficiencies; and the disparities are displayed in detail by the estimation at the plant level. The disparities are primarily caused by the generator combination and generation hour arrangement. Competition may be able to solve the disparities, but a further comparison indicates that competition at the national level will enhance the efficiency to a greater degree than competition at the regional level. These results demonstrate that both competition and a united electricity market are necessary for further electricity market reform. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to determine regional balances of excess heat relative heat demands for all third level administrative regions in the European Union (EU) and to identify strategic regions suitable for large-scale implementation of district heating. The approach is motivated since the efficiency of current supply structures to meet building heat demands, mainly characterised by direct use of primary energy sources, is low and improvable. District heating is conceived as an urban supply side energy efficiency measure employable to enhance energy system efficiency by increased excess heat recoveries; hereby reducing primary energy demands by fuel substitution. However, the importance of heat has long been underestimated in EU decarbonisation strategies and local heat synergies have often been overlooked in energy models used for such scenarios. Study results indicate that 46% of all excess heat in EU27, corresponding to 31% of total building heat demands, is located within identified strategic regions. Still, a realisation of these rich opportunities will require higher recognition of the heat sector in future EU energy policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results suggest that holding CAFE standards at the 2010 level could facilitate U.S. ethanol market expansion, making it easier to meet the mandate. Alternative-fuel vehicle production incentives appear to have small effects. However, there is uncertainty about the level of automaker response to those incentives, and analysis indicates the model is fairly sensitive to the assumed level of response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, all the research can become meaningless without understanding the public feelings about the disposal. The events at Fukushima in 2011 altered the perception towards nuclear-waste storage in the country. This work investigates the attitude of young Japanese towards the construction of a repository following the Fukushima crisis, and examines how public perception changed after the event A survey among 545 university students from different regions of Japan addressed three main variables: dread, trust and acceptance. The results suggest that the economy of the country is still the most concerning issue, but there was a dramatic increase of attention towards everything nuclear. Radiation leakage and food contamination are major concerns as well. The distrust towards the government deepened after Fukushima, although more than half of the respondents would accept the repository. In a clear phenomenon of NIMBY (not in my back yard), the acceptance drops to less than 20% if the repository is to be installed near the respondents' residency. Financial incentives would increase the acceptability of the siting, although only a substantial compensation might minimise the NIMBY in potential host communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we presented the rationale of China's two-phase EVSS and estimated their impacts on EV market penetration, with a focus on the ownership cost analysis of battery electric passenger vehicles (BEPV). Based on the ownership cost comparison of five defining BEPV models and their counterpart conventional passenger vehicle (CPV) models, we concluded that in the short term, especially before 2015, China's EVSS is very necessary for BEPVs to be cost competitive compared with CPVs. The transition from phase Ito phase II EVSS will generally reduce subsidy intensity, thus resulting in temporary rise of BEPV ownership cost. However, with the decrease of BEPV manufacturing cost, the ownership cost of BEPV is projected to decrease despite of the phase-out mechanism under phase II EVSS. In the mid term of around 2015-2020, BEPV could become less or not reliant on subsidy to maintain cost competitiveness. However, given the performance disadvantages of BEPV, especially the limited electric range, China's current EVSS is not sufficient for the BEPV market to take off. Technology improvement associated with battery cost reduction has to play an essential role in starting up China's BEPV market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relatively little is known about how public inputs can improve nuclear decision-making. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of public opinions regarding nuclear energy by examining its risk perception, trust and public engagement dimensions. Based on a survey of Hong Kong residents (n=509), we make some observations. Firstly, we offer empirical evidence that affirms the theoretical connections between risk perception, trust, and public engagement in the context of nuclear energy. Secondly, our logistic regression analysis indicates that demographics, trust, and perceptions of the efficacy of public engagement are factors explaining perceptions of greater risks and nuclear opposition. Thirdly, our conceptual model sheds light on the complexity of the trust concept, and specifies aspects of trust that are influential in the contexts of risk perception and nuclear choices. Our findings suggest that the Hong Kong government must ensure trust building receives prominent attention in nuclear decision-making, and that it should avoid excessive reliance on the business sector and should assume a key role for itself in enhancing trust in nuclear decision-making.

Five case studies of different domestic energy technology schemes in England highlight the influence of advisers and installers in householders' decisions to adopt low carbon technologies. Many of these advisers and installers are micro-enterprises working in connected groups in particular geographic areas. Such micro-enterprises form a large part of the construction sector, but despite the number of enterprises and the potential impact of changes in the behaviour of the sole traders and small firms, there appears to be little policy that specifically targets this group. Data from these case studies is presented and organised into a typological framework, in order to illustrate the range of ways in which the impact of advisers and installers can be modified. Two of the six factors in the typological framework relate to the motivation of installers themselves and how their work is perceived by their clients. By examining these factors in particular, this paper makes a novel contribution to understanding the factors that influence the take up and use of domestic energy technologies, leading to the possibility of new policy options or interventions.

To maintain resource adequacy for a grid's reliable operation, one option is to expand conventional generation, whose marginal unit is typically fueled by natural-gas. Two timely and relevant questions thus arise for a deregulated wholesale electricity market: (1) what is the likely price increase due to a nuclear plant shutdown? and (2) what can be done to mitigate the price increase? To answer these questions, we perform a regression analysis of a large sample of hourly real-time electricity-market price data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) for the 33-month sample period of April 2010-December 2012. Our analysis indicates that the 2013 shutdown of the state's San Onofre plant raised the CAISO real-time hourly market prices by $6/MWH to $9/MWH, and that the price increases could have been offset by a combination of demand reduction, increasing solar generation, and increasing wind generation.

Sectoral and regional expansion of the trading scheme is beneficial in aggregate, but not necessarily for individual countries. We simulate international CO2 emission quota markets using marginal abatement cost functions and the Copenhagen 2020 climate policy targets for selected countries that strategically allocate emissions in a bid to manipulate the quota price. Quota exporters and importers generally have conflicting interests about admitting more countries to the trading coalition, and our results indicate that some countries may lose substantially when the coalition expands in terms of new countries. For a given coalition, expanding sectoral coverage makes most countries better off, but some countries (notably the USA and Russia) may lose out due to loss of strategic advantages.

Using the crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and propane volatility futures energy time series with 1-month and 3-month maturities, we found that five out of the eight time series are characterized by both long memory and structural breaks. For these series, dates of breaks coincide with some major economics and financial events. For the three other time series, we found strong evidence of long memory in volatility.

By guiding policy in choosing the most appropriate strategy for facing some frequent dilemmas, this paper has clear implications in regional development policy and adds to the existent literature in three ways. First, it contributes to a better characterization of dynamic externalities by extending the advantages of backwardness approach, formerly developed to explain the catching-up of national economies, to the regional context. Second, the paper presents a new model that relates static and dynamic externalities to the clustering mode of production in the regional context. Third, the paper contributes to give a more accurate theoretic basis to the regional cluster policy and to help policy-makers in choosing the right policy for increasing the well-being of depressed regions. The major conclusion is that policy must pursue a combination of the comparative advantage principle with one type of dynamic externalities uncovered in this paper: the related variety benefits of agglomeration.","[Pessoa, Argentino] Univ Porto, CEF UP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Pessoa, Argentino] Univ Porto, NIFIP, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Pessoa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, CEF UP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",apessoa@fep.up.pt,"Pessoa, Argentino/B-6166-2009","Pessoa, Argentino/0000-0002-4859-1407",,,,,127,20,23,0,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We show that these estimators are asymptotically normal and efficient. When the (binary) instrument satisfies one-sided noncompliance, we propose a Durbin-Wu-Hausman-type test of whether treatment assignment is unconfounded conditional on some observables. The test is based on the fact that under one-sided noncompliance LATT coincides with the average treatment effect for the treated (ATT). We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate, among other things, that part of the theoretical efficiency gain afforded by unconfoundedness in estimating ATT survives pretesting.

The 2005 Indian Human Development Survey showed that on average, electricity availability (hours of supply per day) in rural and urban households were 14 and 19 h, respectively (Desai et al., 2007). Using nationally representative data from Indian Human Development Survey, this study estimated the impact of electricity access and availability on two attributes of human well-being, viz education and health attainment. It found a significant positive relationship between electricity availability and well-being in rural and urban households. Electricity accessibility revealed a significant positive relationship only for rural households. The paper concludes with implications for electricity policy and infrastructure choices.

However, the use of biomass as an industrial fuel in the US has grown, and now exceeds that of coal. Using data from 1960 to 2011, interfuel substitution in the US industrial sector is modeled with a dynamic linear logit model which includes biomass alongside the other four traditional fuels. Adding biomass to the model reduces somewhat the estimated own-price and cross-price elasticities for the other four fuels, while revealing that biomass and natural gas are substitute fuels. This implies that previous studies excluding biomass may have overestimated the potential for interfuel substitution, giving policy makers an inaccurate impression of the ability of carbon taxes or other environmental regulation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

An analysis is conducted of the share prices changes as caused by the first publication of compliance data in April, 2006, which disclosed an over-allocation of emission allowances. Through an event study, it is shown that share prices actually increased as a result of the allowance price drop when firms have a lower carbon-intensity of production and larger allowance holdings. There was no significant value impact from firms' allowance trade activity or from the pass-through of carbon-related production costs (carbon leakage). The conclusion is that the EU ETS does 'bite'. The main impact on the share prices of firms arises from their carbon-intensity of production. The EU ETS is thus valued as a restriction on pollution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The sample consisted of 561 respondents from the German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland. Results suggest that changes in benefits perception were mainly. responsible for people's changes in attitude toward nuclear power.

J. Banks and regional development: an empirical analysis on the determinants of credit availability in Brazilian regions, Regional Studies. This paper studies the influence that liquidity preference and bank lending strategies might have played in the determination of bank credit availability in Brazilian regions during the period 1999-2008. It puts forward the argument that in remoter and less developed regions, the liquidity preference of agents is higher and fluctuates along business cycles, reducing regional credit availability in downturns (due to both a contraction in supply and the demand for credit in remoter regions), and producing a more unstable pattern for credit availability alongside business cycles. Empirical evidence for the Brazilian regions during the period 1999-2008 is provided to support this view.","[Crocco, Marco; Faria-Silva, Fernanda; Paulo-Rezende, Luiz] FACE UFMG, CEDEPLAR, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Rodriguez-Fuentes, Carlos J.] Univ La Laguna, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Appl Econ, E-38071 S C De Tenerife, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Crocco, M (通讯作者)，FACE UFMG, CEDEPLAR, Ave Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",crocco@cedeplar.ufmg.br; ferfaria@cedeplar.ufmg.br; rezende@cedeplar.ufmg.br; cjrodrig@ull.edu.es,"Silva, Fernanda Faria/C-9056-2015; Crocco, Marco/F-7277-2012; Rodriguez-Fuentes, Carlos J./L-4003-2013","Silva, Fernanda Faria/0000-0003-0871-4502; Rodriguez-Fuentes, Carlos J./0000-0003-1885-4429; REZENDE, LUIZ PAULO FONTES DE/0000-0001-7044-2152",,,,,42,11,13,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We accommodate that concern by distinguishing intra- and inter-generational discounting in an OLG model suitable for analyzing sustainability issues. Under the assumption of constant elasticity of marginal felicity, the optimum trajectory of aggregate consumption is guided, via the Ramsey condition, by the intergenerational discount rate but not the personal discount rate. In an economy with produced capital and a renewable resource, intergenerational neutrality results in a sustained growth path, without the necessity of a sustainability constraint, even in the presence of intragenerational impatience. We also find that green net national product remains constant along the optimal approach path to golden rule consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I develop a dynamic model of observational learning and costly search wherein a green consumer product enters a market to challenge an established dirty product. Purchase decisions depend on price and quality differences, consumers' willingness-to-pay to protect the environment, and the cost of obtaining information. Using both theoretical analyses and simulations, I solve for the long-term market performance of the green product. Conditions are provided for when it is socially optimal to encourage green purchases with public policy. Comparative statics predict the effectiveness of various policy tools used to improve market performance. Permanent financial incentives are shown to be more effective than informational campaigns at encouraging green purchases if the green product is inferior to the dirty substitute. Temporary financial incentives are shown to be an ineffective tool to encourage the long-term market success of any green product.

This study attempts to specify the determinants of sectoral electricity demand, forecast future electricity consumption by creating a model using the Johansen cointegration methodology and estimate the sectoral electricity conservation potential. Results indicate that GDP per capita is the leading force explaining the sectoral electricity consumption increase, while value-added per worker, R&D intensity and electricity price are the main factors contributing to the sectoral electricity consumption decrease. Results demonstrate that sectoral electricity consumption in 2020 will be 369.79-464.83 billion kWh under the low-growth scenario and 530.14-666.39 billion kWh under the high-growth scenario. Moreover, under the low-growth scenario, the sectoral electricity conservation potential in 2020 will be 33.72-95.03 billion kWh, accounting for 0.45-1.26% of China's total electricity demand in 2020; under the high-growth scenario, the sectoral electricity conservation potential in 2020 will be 48.34-136.24 billion kWh, accounting for 0.26-0.74% of world's total electricity consumption in 2010 respectively.

Our modeling framework features a high spatial and temporal resolution of electricity supply and demand, including renewable energy resources and generating technologies, while representing CO2 abatement options in non-electric sectors as well as economy-wide interactions. We find that clean and renewable energy standards entail substantial efficiency costs compared to a carbon pricing policy such as a cap-and-trade program or a carbon tax, and that these policies are regressive across the income distribution. The geographical distribution of cost is characterized by high burdens for regions that depend on non-qualifying generation fuels, primarily coal. Regions with abundant hydro power and wind resources, and a relatively clean generation mix in the absence of policy, are among the least impacted. An important shortcoming of energy standards vis-a-vis a carbon pricing policy is that no revenue is generated that can be used to alter unintended distributional consequences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This is mainly attributed to the lack of methods that evaluate non-technological drivers of energy use for large stocks of commercial buildings to support policy making efforts. Therefore, this study proposes a scientific approach to quantifying the energy savings potential due to improved operations of any stock of commercial buildings. The proposed framework combines energy modeling techniques, studies on human actions in buildings, and surveying and sampling methods. The contributions of this study to energy policy are significant as they reinforce the role of human actions in energy conservation, and support efforts to integrate operation-focused solutions in energy conservation policy frameworks. The framework's capabilities are illustrated in a case study performed on the stock of office buildings in the United States (US). Results indicate a potential 21 percent reduction in the current energy use levels of these buildings through realistic changes in current building operation patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents long-term strategies for transmission infrastructure development to integrate increasing amounts of renewable generation in the time horizon of 2030-2050. These are part of the outcomes of the SUSPLAN project,(1) which focuses on four possible future renewable deployment scenarios in different European regions taking into account the corresponding infrastructure needs, especially electricity and gas grids, both on regional and transnational level. The main objective of the project is the development of guidelines for the integration of renewable energy into future energy infrastructures while taking account of national and regional characteristics.

The development of China's wind power sector has often been used to illustrate this point. China's domestic wind power market is the largest in the world and is largely supplied by domestic manufacturers. Competition for market share in the domestic market may pressure firms to innovate, which consecutively improves prospects for global expansion. This paper reviews developments in China's domestic wind turbine market using the Technological Innovation System framework. We analyze the pressure to innovate arising from market competition and assess the prospects for global expansion of Chinese wind turbine manufacturers. We conclude that domestic customers are not pressured or incentivized to perform with respect to power output, such that turbine manufacturers are not pressured to perform with respect to turbine efficiency or maintenance needs. Pressure to innovate is further reduced by formalizing connections between wind farm developers and turbine manufacturers. Chinese turbine manufacturers cannot yet compete with leading global brands in technological leadership. The prospects for exports are improved, however, by the preferential supply of project financing from institutional investors, such as the China Development Bank, from Chinese utilities that seek global expansion and from the manufacturers themselves.

This paper develops and extends Axon et al.'s proposed framework in two ways. First, by extending its applicability from tenanted to owner-occupied properties. Second, by situating it within the literature related to organizational culture, occupant behaviours, and technology adoption. The paper begins with a brief review of the existing research on people, energy and commercial buildings. This literature tends to address either organizational choices, or occupant behavior, but it rarely crosses the analytical boundaries between these two groups. The paper then explores these different levels of analysis within a 3Cs - concern, capacity, and conditions - framework, which was developed to describe and distinguish organizational responses to an energy crisis. The combination of the building communities and 3Cs frames reveals gaps and grey areas between organizational 'culture, occupant behaviour, and technology adoption where further conservation opportunities may lie. These understudied areas suggest that there may be social potential for change that is between and beyond the frames used by previous research in the field. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This presupposes public support for new technologies, which means the public must deal with challenges in terms of placement, area requirements, ecological degradation and price developments. This paper discusses how citizens view renewable energy technologies. It analyses responses to representative surveys of the Norwegian population on the desirability of various energy technologies such as hydroelectric dams, onshore and offshore wind energy, bioenergy plants and, for contrast, gas plants with and without carbon capture and storage. Our main focus is on the influence of party political preference on views of renewable energy.

Focusing on the recent results of the GEO.POWER project, this paper aims at examining the energy performance strategies and the future regional and national financial instruments for large scale introduction of geothermal energy and GCHP systems in both residential and industrial buildings. After a transferability assessment to evaluate the reproducibility of some outstanding examples of systems currently existing in Europe for the utilisation of shallow geothermal energy, a set of regulatory, economic and technical actions is proposed to encourage the GCHP market development and support geothermal energy investments in the frame of the existing European normative platforms. This analysis shows that many European markets are changing from a new GCHP market to growth market. However some interventions are still required, such as incentives, regulatory framework, certification schemes and training activities in order to accelerate the market uptake and achieve the main European energy and climate targets.

This production increase has been made possible by the existence of alternative oil-recovery technologies and persistently elevated oil prices that make these technologies commercially viable. We first discuss the factors that have enabled the United States to expand production so rapidly and the glut of oil inventory that has accumulated in the Midwest as a result of logistical challenges and export restrictions. Next, we assess the extent to which the increase in U.S. domestic production will affect global supply conditions and whether the U.S. experience can be repeated in other countries with unconventional oil sources. The evidence suggests that even in the best-case scenario, the increase in U.S. oil production is unlikely to have a large effect on the global oil market's demand-supply balance, so its effect on the price of oil is expected to be limited. Furthermore, the United States enjoys unique infrastructural and technological advantages that make it unlikely that rapid increases in unconventional production can be achieved elsewhere.

In particular, it tests for the importance of labour mobility across so-called skill-related industries between 435 four-digit industries within 72 Swedish functional regions (1998-2002). Both the fixed-effect models and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimates demonstrate that a strong intensity of intra-regional labour flows between skill-related industries impacts positively on regional productivity growth, but less so on employment growth. Labour mobility between unrelated industries tends to dampen regional unemployment growth while a high degree of intra-industry labour flows is only found to be associated with rising unemployment.","[Boschma, Ron] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Eriksson, Rikard H.; Lindgren, Urban] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",Lund University; Utrecht University; Umea University,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Solvegatan 16, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",ron.boschma@circle.lu.se; rikard.eriksson@umu.se; urban.lindgren@umu.se,,"Eriksson, Rikard/0000-0003-3570-7690; Lindgren, Urban/0000-0003-2796-3547",,,,,87,85,90,5,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Since Reform and Opening-up was implemented, Chinese economy and social consciousness has had earthshaking changes and both social civilization level and economic richness degree have got unprecedented improvement. However, national identity cannot simply be considered to equal economic development. Indeed, people's national identity belongs to an ideological scope, which is also affected by other factors. Especially for ethnic minorities' sports culture, cultural accumulation of ethnic minorities is relatively poor. If we do not value satisfaction and response to their cultural demands, various kinds of national problems will be caused easily. This requires that we should pay attention to caring for and responding to increasingly growing spiritual and cultural demands of people and realize people's high national identity via reasonable guidance about cultural consumption.","[Hu, Yingqing] Guangxi Coll Sports & Phys Educ, Nanning 530012, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yunong] Baise Univ, Baise 533001, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xinping] Guangxi Univ Nationalities, Nanning 530006, Peoples R China",Baise University; Guangxi Minzu University,,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,8,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-62520-34-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2014,13.0,,,,,,51.0,55,,,,,,5,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC0SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349486900012,0

They are key fuels used in road transport and power generation. Households use kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for lighting and cooking. In this era of high oil prices, if the product is state-subsidized, the government budget bears the brunt of price increases. If the price changes are passed through to consumers, the household budgets are impacted directly. The countries most vulnerable to oil price shocks are the low-income oil importers which are disproportionately concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa. End user prices are affected by several factors: market size and economies of scale, mode of product transport, controlled pricing, protection of inefficient domestic suppliers, degree of competition, clear and stable legal framework, effective monitoring and disclosure of industry statistics. This paper is based on two recent studies of the oil sectors of several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa which posed the following questions: Is each stage in the supply chain, from import of crude oil or refined products to retail, efficiently run and are the efficiency gains passed on to end-users? If not, what are the potential causes and possible means of remedying the problems? (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This problem is formulated as a mean-risk model with a special choice of shortfall constraints that leads to quadratic programming. We show the methodology of finding an optimal solution to such problem even if the said quadratic programming is non-convex. The non-convexity comes from our demand that the model should favour the positive deviations from expected returns of the portfolio. First the former problem is converted to semi-definite programming (SDP) problem using semi-definite relaxation technique. In the literature it is shown that this will provide a good proximate for the former problem. The SDP is solved using interior point methods with self-concordant barrier. These methods have in worst case scenario polynomial time complexity. The last issue that we face is the issue of feasibility of the solution of the relaxed problem.

The paper explores the question whether agents can spontaneously coordinate on such a belief in case of fiat money. Formation of monetary equilibrium is studied in the monetary search model, which is similar to Kiyotaki-Wright model. The model is characterized by decentralized trading where agents have to decide whether to accept fiat money or not. Each agent has some belief about money acceptability and chooses optimal action with respect to this belief. The belief is updated after each trade. To allow for non-equilibrium dynamics the model is solved by means of agent based simulation. The paper shows what conditions have to be met in order for monetary equilibrium to arise. The effects of network type, total number of agents in society and initial conditions on the acceptability of fiat money are examined.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Stanek, R (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",ros-tanek@mail.muni.cz,"Staněk, Rostislav/AAL-7813-2021","Staněk, Rostislav/0000-0002-6310-4777",,,,,7,0,0,0,2,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,956.0,961,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900164,0

Hence, this research hopes to incorporate both structural equation model (SEM) and fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) to identify a mutual relationship between the various elements, so as to provide feasible recommendations for management strategies. Initially, SEM is used for identification of correlation between the elements and indicating their direction and strength. A standardized causal coefficient from SEM was then used to create an FCM illustrating the effect of the status of one component on the status of another component. The research results pointed out that policy would be the major challenge faced by wind power development, as well as the main cause for other obstructions. Therefore, under the objective of maximizing economic benefits, short-term strategies can adopt suitable measures for the two dimensions of technology and environment; and while mid-term strategies must consider the indirect influences from social dimension, long-term strategies must work on policy.

Before advising farmers to convert traditional houses to solar houses, it is necessary to understand their willingness to do so. Based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), this study examined nine factors related to farmers' willingness (FW). A survey was conducted in Chongqing with 465 participants. Nine hypotheses were proposed based on literature studies. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to test the data with the SPSS software package. Three of the nine factors had positive and significant impacts on FW, which were quality of life, government commitments and neighbours'/friends' assessments; two factors had negative and significant impacts, which were additional monthly out-of-pocket expenses and switching cost; and the remaining four factors had no significant impacts, which were durability, popularity, timing and local solar market maturity. Based on the findings, suggestions are made to properly introduce solar houses to Chinese farmers and to quickly stimulate market activities. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, sustainability credentials of 2G biofuels are also being questioned. Drawing on work in Science and Technology Studies, we argue that controversies help focus attention on key, often value-related questions that need to be posed to address broader societal concerns. This paper examines lessons drawn from the 1G controversy to assess implications for the sustainability appraisal of 2G biofuels. Scope: We present an overview of key 1G sustainability challenges, assess their relevance for 2G, and highlight the challenges for policy in managing the transition. We address limitations of existing sustainability assessments by exploring where challenges might emerge across the whole system of bioenergy and the wider context of the social system in which bioenergy research and policy are done. Conclusions: Key lessons arising from 1G are potentially relevant to the sustainability appraisal of 2G biofuels depending on the particular circumstances or conditions under which 2G is introduced. We conclude that sustainability challenges commonly categorised as either economic, environmental or social are, in reality, more complexly interconnected (so that an artificial separation of these categories is problematic).

However, as survey results indicate that the relationship between wind turbine noise and annoyance may differ from noise-annoyance relationships for other common noise sources (e.g., rail, traffic), there are concerns that the application of general noise guidelines for wind turbines may lead to unacceptably high levels of annoyance in communities. In this study, previously published survey results that quantified wind turbine noise and self-reported annoyance were applied to the predicted noise levels (from turbines and transformers) for over 8000 receptors in the vicinity of 13 planned wind power developments in the province of Ontario, Canada. The results of this analysis indicate that the current wind turbine noise restrictions in Ontario will limit community exposure to wind turbine related noise such that levels of annoyance are unlikely to exceed previously established background levels of noise-related annoyance from other common noise sources. This provides valuable context that should be considered by policy-makers when evaluating the potential impacts of wind turbine noise on the community. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although solar energy and wind power have been in use for providing power for tourist attractions, the value of using waste biomass for energy production is still poorly understood. Here we advocate a promising approach that produces energy from green waste created by tourism attractions currently existing in large numbers and is still increasing dramatically. Using the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) of China as an example, we evaluated the potential of utilizing green waste to produce energy from 385 tourist attractions in 16 cities of this region. Our results showed that the total potential energy production using the green waste biomass was estimated at 6740 TJ/yr (1 TJ = 10(12) J) with an average of 137 GJ/ha/yr (1 GJ = 10(9) J), accounting for 6% (the average of the Yangtze River Delta, some scenic areas up to 93%) of YRD's tourism industry's energy consumption in 2008. The use of green waste for energy production is possible using current technology and could result in a win-win approach by reducing waste and increasing the renewable energy yields.

This project examines U.S. public support for nuclear energy one year after the Fukushima tragedy, seeking to understand the influence of knowledge and risk perceptions on policy support.

As a result, we need city authorities to act, by using their competences as policy makers as well as energy users. However, cities are still not moving as fast as one might expect, indicating the need for additional incentives to prompt local action. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present an overview of external incentives that might prompt cities to act and to highlight good practices that could be used in future initiatives. This paper first discusses how to evaluate the climate and energy performance of a city and how local authorities can contribute to its improvements. Moreover, it analyses the disincentives that local governments are confronted with, categorizing them as simple market failures, institutional failures and multi-agent failures. The paper then presents a survey of initiatives at national and EU levels to promote local action towards a low-carbon future; grouping them into tambourines, carrots and sticks.

Congestion is investigated in three scenarios which differ in the location of power resources and the line expansion projects accomplished. Results show that the TYNDP and overlay line projects proposed in 2011 are not sufficient measures to cope with the increasing demand for transmission capacity. The paper also concludes that if power generation resources are moved closer to demand centers grid bottlenecks can be partly relieved by 2030.

But existing modelling techniques that help form these expert assessments often ignore the existence of uncertainty. Consequently, techniques to measure these uncertainties are of increasing importance. We use one technique, expert elicitation, to assess six key uncertain parameters with 25 UK energy experts across academia, government and industry. We obtain qualitative descriptions of the uncertain parameters and a novel data set of probability distributions describing individual expert beliefs. We conduct a sensitivity analysis on weights for a linear opinion pool and show that aggregated median beliefs in 2030 are: for oil price $120/barrel (90% CI: 51, 272); for greenhouse gas price $34/tCO(2)e (90% CI: 5, 256) and for levelised cost of low-carbon electricity 17.1 US cents/kWh (90% CI: 8.3, 31.0).

A case study for Indiana estimates the value of wind capacity and demonstrates how to optimize its level and the levels of other generation resources. Changes are driven by temporal patterns of wind power output and load. System wide impacts are calculated for energy, capacity, and costs under multiple wind expansion scenarios which highlight the geographic characteristics of a systems portfolio of wind generation.

This study has shown that it is possible to expand the energy supply in the State using residual biomass from the sugar cane and pig production. On the other side, the biodiesel production increase in the State will depend on the expansion in the consumption of products that use the cake as raw material; the increase in the feedstock availability other than canola, castor beans and sunflower; the increase of the number of family farmers as feedstock providers, so as to ensure access for biodiesel producers to the Social Fuel Stamp.

Regional biopolitics, Regional Studies. This paper seeks to bring ideas about biopolitics and its associated political technologies to bear on the variety of regional geographies that affect the practices of governing populations today. After outlining some of the ways in which populations and their characteristics feature as matters of governmental concern, the paper then briefly summarizes Michel Foucault's account of biopolitics and its association with the formation of national population and nation-states. While there are good reasons why discussions of biopolitics have tended to emphasize the national scale, a full account of biopolitical practices would also attend to the complex spatialities of populations and government. Drawing on Stephen Legg's scalar account of the relationship between population, biopolitics and government, the paper considers the tentative emergence of what might be termed regional biopolitics in contemporary Europe. Recent changes in workforce skills policy in the United Kingdom provide a case study to examine how a typical biopolitical concern (the skill levels of the population) relates to the rise and subsequent fall of regional governance in England.","Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Durham University,"Painter, J (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",j.m.painter@durham.ac.uk,,"Painter, Joe/0000-0001-5306-9333",,,,,54,13,15,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

These policies focus in two directions, depending on whether they involve the reduction of emissions or the mitigation through carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration. In this paper, the Tier 3 methodology from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme and the Environment Agency (EMEP/EEA) was applied to determine the evolution of Spanish motorway GHG emissions in the period 2005-2010. According to the results, though the average daily traffic (ADT) is the major parameter, the average fleet age and vehicle size also affect the level of emissions. Data analysis also revealed a clear connection between the decrease in European trade volume during the financial crisis and the GHG release, despite its temporary character. Among the three improvement scenarios evaluated, reduced speed limit seems the most direct measure while the consequences of afforestation strongly depend on the traffic density of the stretch of the motorway considered. Finally, technological improvement requires a drastic change in the fleet to obtain substantial decrease. The combination of different policies would allow a more robust strategy with lower GHG emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The regulatory authority in Great Britain, however, believed that sometimes electricity prices were significantly higher than what was expected and, therefore, introduced price-cap regulation and divestment series. In this study, I analyze how the introduced institutional changes and regulatory reforms affected the dynamics of daily electricity prices in the England and Wales wholesale electricity market during 1990-2001. This research finds that the introduction of price-cap regulation did achieve the goal of lowering the price level at the cost of higher price volatility. Later, the first series of divestments is found to be successful at lowering price volatility, which however happens at the cost of a higher price level. Finally, this study also documents that the second series of divestments was more successful at lowering both the price level and volatility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior studies suggest numerous reasons for this stagnation. This article empirically assesses those claims. Using an anonymous opinion survey completed by 229 CCS experts, we identified four primary barriers to CCS commercialization: (1) cost and cost recovery, (2) lack of a price signal or financial incentive, (3) long-term liability risks, and (4) lack of a comprehensive regulatory regime. These results give empirical weight to previous studies suggesting that CCS cost (and cost recovery) and liability risks are primary barriers to the technology. However, the need for comprehensive rather than piecemeal CCS regulation represents an emerging concern not previously singled out in the literature. Our results clearly show that the CCS community sees fragmented regulation as one of the most significant barriers to CCS deployment. Specifically, industry is united in its preference for a federal regulatory floor that is subject to state-level administration and sensitive to local conditions. Likewise, CCS experts share broad confidence in the technology's readiness, despite continued calls for commercial-scale demonstration projects before CCS is widely deployed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the potential for residential demand response to reduce pollutant emissions on days with above average pollutant emissions and a high potential for poor air quality. The study focused on New York City (NYC) due to non-attainment with NAAQS standards, large exposed populations, and the existing goal of reducing pollutant emissions. The baseline demand response scenario simulated a 1.8% average reduction in NYC peak demand on 49 days throughout the summer. Nitrogen oxide and particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter emission reductions were predicted to occur (-70, -1.1 metric tons (MT) annually), although, these were not likely to be sufficient for NYC to meet the NAAQS. Air pollution mediated damages were predicted to decrease by $100,000-$300,000 annually. A sensitivity analysis predicted that substantially larger pollutant emission reductions would occur if electricity demand was shifted from daytime hours to nighttime hours, or the total consumption decreased. Policies which incentivize shifting electricity consumption away from periods of high human and environmental impacts should be implemented, including policies directed toward residential consumers.

Venture capital, the regions and public policy: the United Kingdom since the post-2000 technology crash, Regional Studies. The geography of venture capital in the United Kingdom has been shaped since the year 2000 by a significant increase in public sector venture capital funds. Venture capital investments are now less concentrated in the South East. However, investment activity in the Midlands and North is dominated by the public sector. Deal sizes in these regions are small. Venture capital, measured by the total amount invested, remains over-concentrated in London and the South East where private sector investors continue to dominate. This paper concludes by questioning whether this increased dependence of Northern regions on public sector venture capital matters.","[Mason, Colin] Univ Strathclyde, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow G1 1XH, Lanark, Scotland; [Pierrakis, Yannis] NESTA, London EC4A 1DE, England",University of Strathclyde,"Mason, C (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow G1 1XH, Lanark, Scotland.",colin.mason@strath.ac.uk; Yannis.Pierrakis@nesta.org.uk,"Pierrakis, Yannis/K-1327-2019","Pierrakis, Yannis/0000-0002-5422-9957",,,,,50,46,51,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Chinese policy makers mainly focus on three factors comprising consumption structure changes, energy technology development, and new energy increments. In addition, sectoral CO2 reduction is inCreasingly concerned in the world. Thus, it is significant to investigate integrated impacts of three factors to China's CO2 mitigation target as well as to identify key economic sectors for achieving this target. In this study, energy demand and CO2 emission in 2020 are predicted. Five scenarios are generated to illustrate the contributions of three factors. In addition, twelve key economic sectors for reducing energy demand and CO2 emission are identified from both production and final demand perspectives. Under integrated impacts of three factors, China's CO2 intensity per unit gross domestic product in 2020 will decrease by about 43.9% in 2020 than 2005 level. In the short term, China's CO2 mitigation will be highly dependent on energy technology development. In the long term, it will mainly rely on reshaped consumption structure changes and new energy development. In addition, China's future policies should focus on 12 identified key economic sectors.

While the energy use-growth nexus is widely examined in the literature, studies on the energy use-trade nexus are very scarce. Thus, this study also serves to fill this gap by presenting a new research on the OECD countries. We employ the panel cointegration technique and use the Granger representation theorem to examine the presence of long-run relationship and the causality between pairs of variables. To investigate the presence of causality, several tests developed by Canning and Pedroni (2008) are used. We find that the pairs of energy use-GDP, energy use-exports and energy use-imports are cointegrated and there is two-way Granger causality between each pairs. We also estimate the long-run elasticities by employing panel dynamic ordinary least squares. The results suggest that the sign of long-run elasticity is positive for all pairs. Particularly, 1% increase in GDP, export and import causes almost 0.32%, 0.21% and 0.16% increase in energy use respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and found that total CO2 emissions from nine industries show an N-shaped trend instead of an inverted U or monotonic increasing trend with increasing income. The EKC hypothesis for sector-level CO2 emissions was supported in the (1) paper, pulp, and printing industry; (2) wood and wood products industry; and (3) construction industry. We also found that emissions from coal and oil increase with economic growth in the steel and construction industries. In addition, the non-metallic minerals, machinery, and transport equipment industries tend to have increased emissions from oil and electricity with economic growth. Finally, the EKC turning point and the relationship between GDP per capita and sectoral CO2 emissions differ among industries according to the fuel type used. Therefore, environmental policies for CO2 reduction must consider these differences in industrial characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to create knowledge for the design and implementatioh of policy measures. The results of an opinion poll conducted in 2005 and 2010 are compared. The number of respondents favouring new technologies as a way to reduce emissions was substantially lower in 2010 than in 2005, whereas there was an increase in the number of people who acknowledged that lifestyle changes are necessary to counteract climate changes. This indicates. an increased awareness among the public of the need for lifestyle changes, which could facilitate implementation of policies promoting environmental behaviour. Renewable energy and energy saving measures were ranked as the top two measures for mitigating climate change in both polls. In determining which energy behaviours of the public are determined by psychological factors, an analysis of the 2010 survey revealed that respondents with pro-environmental attitudes towards global warming favour significantly increased use of renewable energy technologies and greater engagement in energy-efficient behaviours.

This study compares the type of advice gained and the form of calculation used for a series of different summertime overheating analyses. Using simple overheating definitions, a case-study dwelling is simulated. for two UK locations across different climate scenarios and the consistency in advice provided by the chosen methods is discussed. The results suggest there are issues around the consistency of such varied models, but also highlight the need to strike a balance between a method that reliably accounts for building thermal performance while also providing a clear and useable approach that can be adopted within industry practice.

The analysis reveals that a lack of competitive conditions in markets, access constraints on the use and the availability of CERs, regulatory changes regarding both EUAs and CERs, and uncertainty surrounding CERs can explain a significant portion of the price spread.

Proximity and the transfer of academic knowledge: evidence from the spatial pattern of industry collaborations of East German professors, Regional Studies. Universities can stimulate local economic development, particularly due to collaboration with local industry. Against this background, this study analyses when these interactions are local. Previous research suggests that universityindustry linkages are mainly local because of tacit knowledge and the importance of physical proximity. This study provides additional evidence that the spatial pattern of universityindustry linkages is a result of a complex matching process of appropriate partners. The results indicate that actors' individual and relational characteristics, institutional factors, and the particular type of knowledge play a role in collaboration. Hence, universityindustry collaborations might not be local.","[Slavtchev, Viktor] Univ Jena, Sch Econ, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Slavtchev, Viktor] Univ Jena, Sch Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Slavtchev, V (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",viktor.slavtchev@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,73,23,24,3,88,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This approach allows for the consideration of the group heterogeneity of electricity generation, non-radial slacks, and undesirable outputs simultaneously. We extend several standardized indices to measure total-factor energy efficiency, CO2 emission performance, and technology gaps in electricity generation. We estimate the potential reductions in energy use and CO2 emissions under different technology assumptions. We conduct an empirical analysis of fossil fuel electricity generation in Korea by using the proposed approach. The results indicate that coal-fired power plants show higher levels of total-factor energy efficiency and CO2 emission performance than oil-fired ones. Under the meta-frontier technology assumption, coal-fired power plants show a smaller technology gap than oil-fired ones. This suggests that the Korean government should promote technological innovation to reduce technology gaps for oil-fired plants,,thereby improving energy and CO2 emission performance and meeting emission reduction targets in the electricity generation industry.

Are the technologies promoted those most needed by the recipient countries? We address this question by first reviewing Technology Needs Assessments prepared by developing countries, and then comparing the stated needs to the technologies most frequently promoted via CDM. While there appears to be a good match between requested technologies and those used in CDM, desired technologies such as solar energy for remote locations, biofuels, improved cooking stoves, and efficient lighting appear neglected by CDM. Nonetheless, a review of costs for these technologies suggests that many could be cost effective for developing countries. For projects requiring wide dispersal of household items, such as cooking stoves or lighting, the administrative burdens of CDM provide a hurdle. In other cases, difficulties quantifying the ancillary benefits of these projects hinder the promotion of these technologies. We conclude with possible explanations for why these technologies are neglected and suggestions for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It also examines the impacts of government policies on manufacturer technology levels. Technology upgrading (measured by increase of turbine size) and catch-up (measured by decrease in the distance to the world technology frontier in terms of turbine size) are used to measure advances in technology level. Results from econometric modeling studies indicate that firms' technology acquisition mechanisms and degree of business diversification are statistically significant factors in influencing technology upgrading. Similar results were found for the catch-up variable (i.e., distance to the world technology frontier). The influence of government policies is significant for technology upgrading but not catch-up. These and other modeling results are shown to have implications for both policymakers and wind turbine manufacturers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assesses the comparative contribution of household scale biogas installations to the broad set of sustainability objectives in the Chinese biogas policy framework, which targets household budget, fuel collection workload, forest degradation, indoor air quality and health, renewable energy supply, and climate change. A household survey was used to determine how biogas affected consumption levels of crop residues, fuel wood, coal, LPG, and electricity. Biogas users were found to reduce consumption of biomass fuels but not coal. Although LPG is not a highly commonly used fuel in rural China, biogas users nearly cease to use it altogether. A big reduction in fuel wood consumption results in strongly reduced workload and forest degradation. Although household scale biogas has alleviated all sustainability issues targeted by Chinese policies, low quality fuel use remains abundant, even in households using biogas. Continued promotion of the construction of biogas installations is advisable, but additional policies are needed to ensure higher quality heating energy supply and cleaner uses of biomass fuels.

In cities these are largely associated with the transport and building sectors. This paper probes the form-efficiency relation in the transport sector across 57 census-defined urbanized areas in the United States in 2000. Thirty-six of the forty largest are included. Increase in core area population density is correlated with modest gain in energy efficiency in the urban transport sector and modest decrease in its. carbon emissions. Densification's lagged effects related to travel rationalization and growth in transit receptivity may increase overall metro transport energy efficiency beyond the degree revealed here. These impacts are associated with two off-setting negative externalities: (1) diminished housing affordability, and (2) increased roadway congestion. Each may moderate over time. Such effects are non-additive, owing to a difference of metrics. Elevated CAFE standards provoking new transport technologies may reduce total energy consumption and associated emissions ceteris paribus, lessening densification's marginal efficiency payoff while magnifying the significance of densification's opportunity costs.

K. Towards a reconciliation of the context-less' with the space-less'? The creative class across varieties of capitalism: new evidence from Sweden and the UK, Regional Studies. The interplay between place, individuals and creativity has, in recent years, received much attention. National differences of how capitalism is organized can be drawn into this discussion, but they are seldom examined systematically. By investigating data from the UK as a liberal market economy and Sweden as a coordinated market economy, this paper develops and tests a set of hypotheses to analyse the role of varieties of capitalism' in relation to the location dynamics of the creative class. Results confirm the effect of the coordinated market economy in flattening the distribution of the creative class, tempered by the Swedish urban hierarchy which acts to concentrate it in a smaller number of (larger) locations. Through combining both contextual and spatial elements, this approach generates new insights into observed variations between the coordinated market economy and the liberal market economy around mobility, adjustment and quality of place, but it also serves to highlight where other additional factors may be influential.","[Clifton, Nick] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ UWIC, Cardiff Sch Management, Cardiff CF5 2YB, S Glam, Wales; [Cooke, Phil] Cardiff Univ, Ctr Adv Studies, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Hansen, Hogni Kalso] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geog & Geol, Copenhagen, Denmark",Cardiff Metropolitan University; Cardiff University; University of Copenhagen,"Clifton, N (通讯作者)，Cardiff Metropolitan Univ UWIC, Cardiff Sch Management, CSM Bldg,Western Ave, Cardiff CF5 2YB, S Glam, Wales.",nclifton@cardiffmet.ac.uk,"Cooke, Philip/GRO-1618-2022; Hansen, Høgni Kalsø/ABB-2367-2020","Hansen, Høgni Kalsø/0000-0001-6174-1417; Clifton, Nick/0000-0001-8606-7369",,,,,58,29,31,0,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper evaluates ex-ante a federal policy option aimed at promoting industrial cogeneration-the production of heat and electricity in a single energy-efficient process. Detailed analysis using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) and spreadsheet calculations suggest that industrial cogeneration could meet 18% of U.S. electricity requirements by 2035, compared with its current 8.9% market share. Substituting less efficient utility-scale power plants with cogeneration systems would produce numerous economic and environmental benefits, but would also create an assortment of losers and winners. Multiple perspectives to benefit/cost analysis are therefore valuable. Our results indicate that the federal cogeneration policy would be highly favorable to manufacturers and the public sector, cutting energy bills, generating billions of dollars in electricity sales, making producers more competitive, and reducing pollution. Most traditional utilities, on the other hand, would lose revenues unless their rate recovery procedures are adjusted to prevent the loss of profits due to customer owned generation and the erosion of utility sales. From a public policy perspective, deadweight losses would be introduced by market-distorting federal incentives (ranging annually from $30 to $150 million), but these losses are much smaller than the estimated net social benefits of the federal cogeneration policy.

However, the scholars and theorists in our country are not mere mechanical imitators. When they check the western feminist literary theory in the Chinese culture context, they find a lot of paradox to our experience. This thesis intends to research: how the Chinese literature theorists carefully and dialectically discern the merits and demerits of the western feminist literary criticism based on China culture and literature present situation. They try to establish our own feminist literary when expounding the western theories. And, more importantly, this article explores the reason between Chinese and western feminist literary criticism: traditional culture is the history reason, the different background between feminist literary criticism in domestic and abroad is another reason leading to divergence.","[Cao Yafeng] Shandong Womens Univ, Jinan 250300, Peoples R China",Shandong Womens University,,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9924140-0-9,,,,2013,,,,,,,74.0,77,,,,,,4,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Women's Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Women's Studies,BB3CH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342650000016,0

In contrast to many earlier approaches, which allow for trend inflation to evolve according to a random walk, ours is a bounded model which ensures that trend inflation is constrained to lie in an interval. The bounds of this interval can either be fixed or estimated from the data. Our model also allows for a time-varying degree of persistence in the transitory component of inflation. In an empirical exercise with CPI inflation, we find the model to work well, yielding more sensible measures of trend inflation and forecasting better than popular alternatives such as the unobserved components stochastic volatility model.

The overlooked impact of new gas-fired generation investment on long-term decarbonisation in the UK,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Lock-in; CCGT; Decarbonisation,HYSTERESIS; ECONOMICS; COSTS,"This paper contrasts the potential increase in gas-fired power generation in the UK in the period to 2020 with the ambitious decarbonisation goals set forth for this sector. An increase in Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) capacity, in particular, only represents a threat to long-term decarbonisation if some 'lock-in' exists. It is against this background, and in the interest of challenging the perception of no significant lock-in to gas-fired generation, that this paper identifies investment lock-in as phenomenon of relevance to policy-makers. The paper determines both direct and indirect ways in which investment in significant new CCGT capacity could negatively impact on the likelihood of meeting decarbonisation goals through 'locking-in' the existing technological system. It also identifies that the technical lifetime, and not just the capital repayment period, of CCGT assets is relevant in understanding the strength of the lock-in. Finally, a regulatory structure that aligns with the long-term targets in place is identified as providing a clear signal for investors and asset owners that may reduce the risk of 'investment lock-in'.

Indeed, renewable energy sources are receiving increasing support worldwide from public authorities because of the environmental benefits they bring in comparison with conventional energy sources. Thus, many countries have set targets for PV deployment. The possibility to achieve them at a lower cost has now become a central issue, making it necessary to examine the efficiency of the instruments used to promote PV. After describing the mechanisms of the impact of demand and supply on the reduction cost of PV systems, the public support for PV is assessed for five representative countries (France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the US) from an extensive policy review. Based on their financial evaluations, the performances of these policies are compared from the different states of PV development in each country.
