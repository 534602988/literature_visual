Specifically, I elaborate on the need to disaggregate and place the EFI into a coherent and meaningful theoretical context in order to generate economically cogent analytical predictions as well as more reasonable public policy recommendations. As it stands, the EFI can produce highly misleading causal results with potentially disastrous consequences for public policy. Hereby, I make a preliminary attempt at constructing an alternative aggregate index to measure the importance of market-related institutions for achieving higher levels of per-capita income. This alternative index, termed here the Good Capitalist Governance Index (GCGI), better correlates with per-capita income and has a higher threshold value than the Economic Freedom Index. The GCGI highlights the importance of secure private rights, limited corruption, and sound money for the realization of higher levels of per-capita income. The evidence supports the hypothesis that good capitalist governance requires a well-working, but not minimalist government.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Altman, M (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand.",,"Altman, Morris/H-2338-2016","Altman, Morris/0000-0002-6779-6547",,,,,28,8,9,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, the policies also lead to an increase in income inequality because the tax cut is more beneficial to households in the highest income categories.

While the former step reduces the number of variables that have to be considered when solving the model, the latter step reduces the dimensionality of the Bellman equation associated with the optimisation problem. The model's solution is shown to be saddle-path stable, such that the phase diagram associated with the Bellman equation has two solution branches. The simplicity of our model allows us to state both the stable and the unstable branch explicitly. We also explain the usefulness of logarithmic preferences when studying the continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

J,"Card, D; DellaVigna, S",,,,"Card, David; DellaVigna, Stefano",,,Nine Facts about Top Journals in Economics,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"How has publishing in top economics journals changed since 1970? Using a data set that combines information on all articles published in the top-five journals from 1970 to 2012 with their Google Scholar citations, we identify nine key trends. First, annual submissions to the top-five journals nearly doubled from 1990 to 2012. Second, the total number of articles published in these journals actually declined from 400 per year in the late 1970s to 300 per year most recently. As a result, the acceptance rate has fallen from 15 percent to 6 percent, with potential implications for the career progression of young scholars. Third, one journal, the American Economic Review, now accounts for 40 percent of top-five publications, up from 25 percent in the 1970s. Fourth, recently published papers are on average three times longer than they were in the 1970s, contributing to the relative shortage of journal space. Fifth, the number of authors per paper has increased from 1.3 in 1970 to 2.3 in 2012, partly offsetting the fall in the number of articles per year. Sixth, citations for top-five publications are high: among papers published in the late 1990s, the median number of Google Scholar citations is 200. Seventh, the ranking of journals by citations has remained relatively stable, with the notable exception of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, which climbed from fourth place to first place over the past three decades. Eighth, citation counts are significantly higher for longer papers and those written by more coauthors. Ninth, although the fraction of articles from different fields published in the top five has remained relatively stable, there are important cohort trends in the citations received by papers from different fields, with rising citations to more recent papers in Development and International, and declining citations to recent papers in Econometrics and Theory.

Our bargaining script secures that only the seller can change prices and terminate negotiations, thus we are able to examine differences in the seller's entire path of negotiation and in the reservation price at which they are willing to trade. We find that male and female passengers who use the same bargaining script are not treated equally. Men face higher initial prices, final prices, and rejection rates. These differences are consistent with male drivers being more reluctant to give-in to demanding negotiations by male passengers, and with male passengers being perceived as having high valuations. To identify whether taste-based or statistical discrimination drives the inferior treatment of men we conduct an experiment where passengers send a signal on valuation before negotiating. The signal eliminates gender differences and the response is shown only to be consistent with statistical discrimination. Thus in the limiting case of a highly competitive market with experienced traders, we do not find evidence of taste-based discrimination, the differential observed is however consistent with statistical discrimination.

The optimal heating oil hedge ratio is first calculated for a variety of downside risk objective functions at different time-horizons using the wavelet transform. Next, associated hedging effectiveness is contrasted for a range of risk metrics, with all metrics showing increasing hedging effectiveness at longer horizons. Moreover, decreased hedging effectiveness is demonstrated for increased levels of uncertainty at higher confidence intervals. While small differences in effectiveness are found across the different hedging objectives, time-horizon effects are found to dominate confirming the importance of the hedging horizon. The findings suggest that while downside risk measures are useful in determining an optimal futures hedge encompassing negative returns, hedging horizon and confidence intervals should also be given careful consideration by the energy hedger.

It draws on both case study evidence and a unique farm-level dataset for 200107. It argues that, despite notable evidence for government support, political economy factors alone cannot explain the emergence of agroholdings in this region. Instead a complex mix of political and pure economic factors favoured agroholding creation. Likewise, it is shown that the persistence of agroholdings in Belgorod cannot easily be reduced to rent seeking. Rather much evidence is found that it is caused by good economic performance of agroholding farms, in particular by improvements in total factor productivity resulting from large investments in modern technology. However, since these investments were mostly credit financed, agroholding farms are exposed to a higher risk of default than independent farms.","[Epshtein, David] NW Res Inst Agr Econ & Org, St Petersburg, Russia; [Hahlbrock, Konstantin] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Wandel, Juergen] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Russian Academy of Sciences; St. Petersburg Federal Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Northwestern Research Institute for Agriculture Economics & Management; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Warsaw School of Economics,"Wandel, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",jwande@sgh.waw.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Epstein, David Berkovich/E-2298-2016",,,,,,68,20,20,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,MAR 1,2013,25.0,1,,,,,59,81,,10.1080/14631377.2013.756673,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,083GU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314451900004,0

In the case of standard' or ordinary' trade, imports are destined for use in the importing country, and exports are largely produced within the country. However, with production sharing, imported parts and components are destined for inclusion in the country's exports. A depreciation of a nation's currency raises its exports. At the same time, imported components become more expensive, which partly offsets the expansionary effect of the depreciation on exports. Using a simple theoretical framework, this paper shows that production networks lower the sensitivity of a country's trade balance to changes in exchange rates. The empirical examination finds Mexico's Maquiladora trade balance to be unresponsive to changes in both, its real effective as well as its real peso-dollar rates, while that for non-Maquiladora category is significantly responsive, in confirmation with the theorized hypothesis.","Illinois Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IL 61701 USA",Illinois Wesleyan University,"Ghosh, A (通讯作者)，Illinois Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IL 61701 USA.",aghosh@iwu.edu,"Ghosh, Amit/AAB-3140-2019",,,,,,13,0,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

First, we aim to clarify the mechanism by which use of farm machinery in Chinese agriculture has grown rapidly over the past decades, using a separate Cobb-Douglas (SCD) production function. Second, we determine under what condition will China's grain self-sufficiency be secured in the next decade. Our empirical results reveal that the supply and factor demand functions based on the SCD form can significantly explain the reality, in particular, the capital demand function. This finding suggests that the recent capital deepening in Chinese agriculture is caused by farmers' behavior in response to the government's directives aimed at securing arable land. Our simulation analysis reveals that the attainment of a 95% self-sufficiency rate would be quite challenging for China, unless the terms of trade in agriculture improve substantially in favor, of producers. China's policy makers must therefore seriously reconsider whether adhering to the policy goal of grain self-sufficiency is worth the effort. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Dependent variables are institutional measures reflecting politics, law, and governmental administration. The explanatory variable of interest is the level of institutions in bordering countries a spatial lag of the dependent variable. Our spatial model directly leads to the identification strategy for the endogenous spatial lag. We implement new results in spatial econometrics to counter missing-data problems usually rife in spatial empirics. Spatial institutional spillovers are statistically significant and economically important. A counter-factual exercise - the non-existence of the USSR - reveals large direct and indirect spillovers. Numerous robustness exercises bolster conclusions, including yearly cross-section regressions, fixed effects estimates, and adding many extra explanatory variables. Moreover, we provide a new theoretical result showing the robustness of estimates in the presence of omitted variables. We extend the core model, allowing different effects for better and worse neighbors, using inverse distance weights, estimating the spatial-Durbin model, and using Polity's institutional measure.

We capture an agent's regret using a reference-dependent utility function in which the agent's utility depends on the performance of his chosen option relative to the performance of the option that would have been best ex post. An uncertain option is represented as a compound lottery. The basic idea is that selecting a compound lottery reveals information, which alters the ex post assessment of what the best choice would have been, inducing regret. We provide sufficient conditions under which regret implies uncertainty aversion in the sense of quasi-concave preferences over compound lotteries.","[Kraehmer, Daniel] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Kraehmer, Daniel] Univ Bonn, Hausdorff Ctr Math, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Stone, Rebecca] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10012 USA",University of Bonn; University of Bonn; New York University,"Krähmer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Adenauer Allee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",kraehmer@hcm.uni-bonn.de; rs2647@nyu.edu,,,,,,,48,17,19,2,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We make use of the variance estimator that utilizes high, low and closing prices proposed by Rogers and Satchell (1991) (RS) and compare it with the performance of the demeaned squared returns. We find that the IT ICSS algorithm exhibits more desirable size and power properties when applied with the RS estimator in comparison to the demeaned squared returns. On the empirical side, we apply the IT ICSS algorithm with the RS estimator and demeaned squared returns of the S&P 500, CAC 40, FTSE 100, IBOVESPA and SZSE Composite indices to detect sudden changes in volatility of both developed and emerging markets. We find that most of the structural breaks detected by the RS estimator can be related to major macroeconomic events while very few of the structural breaks detected by demeaned squared returns can be related to macroeconomic events and hence are probably spurious.

We focus on a product design choice by which a firm can control the dispersion of consumer valuations for its product; we interpret low-dispersion products as generic and high-dispersion products as nichy. Equilibrium product design depends on a feedback loop: when reservation utility is high (low), the marginal customer's match improves (worsens) with more nichy products, encouraging high (low) differentiation by firms. In turn, when firms offer more nichy products, this induces more intense search; depending on search costs, this could raise or lower consumers' reservation utility. Remarkably, when the match distribution satisfies a hazard rate condition, firm and consumer interests align: equilibrium product design always adjusts to the level that maximizes utility. When this condition is not met, either multiple equilibria (one nichy, the other generic) or one asymmetric equilibrium (generic and nichy firms coexist) can arise; we argue that the former is more likely for common specifications of consumer preferences.","Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Larson, N (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",larson@virginia.edu,,"Larson, Nathan/0000-0002-7647-7572",,,,,21,9,13,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

A substantial share of that increase was comprised of increases in the fees paid for asset management. This paper examines the significant increase in asset management fees charged to both individual and institutional investors. One could argue that the increase in fees charged by actively managed funds could prove to be socially useful if it reflected increasing returns for investors from active management or if it was necessary to improve the efficiency of the market for investors who availed themselves of low-cost passive (index) funds. But neither of these arguments can be supported by the data. Actively managed funds of publicly traded securities have consistently underperformed index funds, and the amount of the underperformance is well approximated by the difference in the fees charged by the two types of funds. Moreover, it appears that there was no change in the efficiency of the market from 1980 to 2011. Thus, the increase in fees is likely to represent a deadweight loss for investors. Indeed, perhaps the greatest inefficiency in the stock market is in the market for investment advice.","[Malkiel, Burton G.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Malkiel, BG (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,14,58,68,3,38,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This friction has been mostly neglected by macroeconomic models of financial imperfections, which have focused almost exclusively on the effects of limited pledgeability. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing a standard growth model with adverse selection. Our main results are that, by fostering unproductive investment, adverse selection: (i) leads to an increase in the economy's equilibrium interest rate, and; (ii) it generates a negative wedge between the marginal return to investment and the equilibrium interest rate. Under international financial integration, we show how this translates into excessive capital inflows and endogenous cycles. We also extend our model to the more general case in which adverse selection and limited pledgeability coexist. We conclude that both frictions complement one another and show that limited pledgeability exacerbates the effects of adverse selection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We test empirically this hypothesis using intraday data along with the recent measure of downside-risk called realized semivariance developed in Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2010). The empirical analysis over the period 1996-2008 provides evidence of a significant relation between semivariance and excess returns at the daily frequency. To gain better understanding of the relation between returns and downside-risk, we investigate the statistical relation between a new measure of conditional asymmetry, namely the ratio of the downside realized semivariance over the variance, and obtain a revealing pattern using a rolling window framework able to link asymmetry in the distribution to future returns. In particular, the asymmetry measure becomes significant when the past realized variance is not significant any more thereby providing insights about a possible change in the behavior of investors.

To do so, we estimate an extended version of the ECB's New Area-Wide Model with a richly specified fiscal sector. The estimation results point to the existence of important complementarities between private and government consumption and, to a lesser extent, between private and public capital. We first examine the implied present-value multipliers for seven distinct fiscal instruments and show that the estimated complementarities result in fiscal multipliers larger than one for government consumption and investment. We highlight the importance of monetary accommodation for these findings. We then show that the EERP, if implemented as initially enacted, had a sizeable, although short-lived impact on euro area GDP. Since the EERP comprised both revenue and expenditure-based fiscal stimulus measures, the total multiplier is below unity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model uses a dynamic approach in which both firms and banks optimize and in which the benefits to a firm of accessing the banking system are endogenous. A firm compares the return to capital with the marginal tax rate on capital income and uses the difference to determine how much of the tax to pay. At the same time, banks use a firm's capital tax payments, combined with the capital tax rate to obtain an estimate of the firm's minimum capital value. If the firm pays at least some taxes then it will have access to the banking system, which will allow it to finance investment. If the firm pays no taxes, then it cannot access the banks and cannot invest. We compare the equilibria resulting from tax compliance and tax evasion. We calibrate the model to a highly stylized version of the Russian economy, and analyze the effect of potential tax changes on the underground economy. We compute a dynamic equilibrium for our model, and note that it tracks the path of certain macroeconomic variables of the Russian economy (GDP, budget and trade balances, price level and interest rate) with some accuracy for the years 2001-2008. We are unable to track the underground economy, as this data is unobservable. We then carry out a series of counterfactual simulations, first asking if non-capital intensive firms have an incentive to evade taxes under existing value added tax rates. We find that they do, and that the incentive would have been greatly reduced if the value added tax rate had been selectively reduced for the non-capital intensive sectors. We then ask what the effect would be if the corporate tax rate were raised on capital intensive sectors. The simulations indicate that the capital intensive sectors would not increase their entry into the underground economy.","[Feltenstein, Andrew] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Shamloo, Maral] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; International Monetary Fund,"Feltenstein, A (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",afeltenstein@gsu.edu; mshamloo@imf.org,,,,,,,14,8,10,1,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

If the primary objective of social capital is to create cohesiveness through the connectivity of community members, then it is clear that parents' school choice decisions are influenced by the groups or organizations to which they belong. Ni (2007) argues that parents' decisions not only influence students' academic performance, but also affect school expenditures. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate the effect of social capital on school performance. The measurement of social capital has been debated for a long time. In this paper we create a geographically bounded community around schools in Mississippi employing GIS instead of following the commonly used political boundaries such as school district or county to measure social capital. Then we estimate the social capital stock for each school to analyze the relationship between the school's performance and existing social capital. Data were collected from the Northeast Regional Center for Rural Development (NRCRD) and the Mississippi Department of Education for the academic year 2005-2006. We find that schools located in communities with a higher stock of social capital significantly outperform those with relatively low levels of social capital. The results also suggest that students' race and socio-economic status significantly reduce primary school performance, holding all else equal. This research helps to understand the importance of social capital from spatial perspectives and will guide policy makers in future resource allocations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Political centralization in pre-colonial Africa In this paper we investigate the empirical correlates of political centralization using data from the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample. We specifically investigate the explanatory power of the standard models of Eurasian state formation which emphasize the importance of high population density, inter-state warfare and trade as factors leading to political centralization. We find that while in the whole world sample these factors are indeed positively correlated with political centralization, this is not so in the African sub-sample. Indeed, none of the variables are statistically related to political centralization. We also provide evidence that political centralization, where it took place, was indeed associated with better public goods and development outcomes. We conclude that the evidence is quite consistent with the intellectual tradition initiated in social anthropology by Evans-Pritchard and Fortes in the 1940s which denied the utility of Eurasian models in explaining patterns of political centralization in Africa.

By focusing on intra-industry trade we consider trade between similar countries. We analyze both trade between developed countries, and trade between developing countries. In our model, final good producers pay an environmental tax on the total pollution emitted in their country. Therefore, final good producers determine the overall level of pollution by demanding cleaner' or dirtier' intermediate goods. To focus on intra-industry trade we consider only intermediate goods firms trade. We analyze three scenarios: closed economy; open economy with no impediments to trade; and open economy with transportation cost. Our main findings are: i. a developing country closed to trade faces lower final good output and higher total pollution and is thus worse off than a developed country; ii. countries are better off under trade than under autarky, regardless of their development level; and iii. an open economy with low transportation costs are better off than an open economy with no impediments to trade.","Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Swart, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",J.Swart@uu.nl,"Swart, Julia/AFT-0201-2022","Swart, Julia/0000-0001-9840-0026",,,,,21,7,8,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Five input-output tables were published by the Department of Statistics in Malaysia for the period under study. A structural change method was carried out to analyze and assess the changes in economic efficiency. This comparative study focuses on changes in the economic structure with different levels of development over time (1980-2005). The change in the economic structure is decomposed into two initial components (technology and total output). In accordance with the results, there appear to be similarities over time in the national structure of production patterns of intermediate use of commodities. Also, the results clearly indicate a rather remarkable degree of commonality in the patterns of growth processes, with more significant differences among sectors than between tables. However, the changes within sectors, and the Malaysian table as a whole, seem to result from changes in the level of the efficiency. Technical relationship seems to have remained relatively unchanged. It is clear that the economy has not moved fast enough forward, and does not seem to be geared by, the type of exports that may sustain a dynamic industrial development, based on external markets. New evidence is revealed in this study: the efficiency degree between demand and supply side for the Malaysian economy still remain weak and changeable over the period of study.

Our paper uses finely detailed Chinese export data (8-digit Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System codes) combined with US trade data to explore how this was achieved. Although general explanations such as China's exchange rate policy no doubt played a role, we find that sector-specific stories, effective Chinese industrial policy and fortuitous timing were more critical. The detailed trade data reveal that new technology goods, such as cell phones, LCD screens and laptops, played a key role. Finally, we use the data to examine the relationship between Chinese exports and global manufacturing, in particular US manufacturing employment. We find that competition from China in both domestic and foreign markets likely contributed to a significant decline in USA manufacturing employment, but that relatively low US investment and slow GDP growth in the US following the 2001 recession played an equally important role.","[Berger, Brett; Martin, Robert F.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Int Finance, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Berger, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Int Finance, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",brett.d.berger@frb.gov; robert.f.martin@frb.gov,,,,,,,12,8,11,0,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2013,21.0,1,,,,,64,90,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12009.x,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,073MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313747300004,0

We build a model where the policy-maker has a tariff and a production subsidy at its disposal, taxation can be distortionary and the import-competing sector lobbies the government for favorable policies. The model shows that, under political pressures, the government will turn to subsidies when its ability to provide protection is curtailed by a trade agreement that binds tariffs only (policy substitution problem). When the factors of production are mobile in the long-run, but the investments are irreversible in the short-run, the government cannot credibly commit vis-a-vis the domestic lobby unless the trade agreement regulates production subsidies in addition to tariffs (policy credibility problem). We employ the theory to analyze the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement within the WTO system. We show that WTO rules on nullification or impairment solves the policy substitution problem, while serious prejudice rules can address the policy credibility problem in sectors with tariff commitments.","[Brou, Daniel] Univ Western Ontario, DAN Management & Org Studies, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Ruta, Michele] World Trade Org, Econ Res & Stat Div, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland",Western University (University of Western Ontario); World Trade Organization,"Brou, D (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, DAN Management & Org Studies, 4425 Social Sci Ctr, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",dbrou@uwo.ca; michele.ruta@wto.org,,,,,,,37,15,15,1,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We argue that decentralization may decrease the size of the shadow economy mainly through two transmission channels: (1) decentralization enhancing public sector efficiency (efficiency effect), and (2) decentralization reducing the distance between bureaucrats and economic agents, which increases the probability of detection of shadow economic activities (deterrence effect). Using various measures of fiscal, political and government employment decentralization in a cross-section of countries, we find the deterrence effect to be of more importance. The deterrence effect is stronger, the lower the degree of institutional quality.

Following Fernandez et al. (2004), I argue that the recent increases in the female labor market participation rate are driven by the growing proportion of men who were brought up in a family with a working mother. First, the paper reexamines the results of the cross-section analysis of Fernandez et al. (2004) using the Swiss Household Panel 2005 to illustrate that married women whose mothers-in-law were working are themselves significantly more likely to be in the labor force. In a second step, the paper attempts to test one of their model's crucial mechanisms and show that the effect of a wife's labor market integration on her husband's well-being diverges depending on the former labor market status of his mother. Taken together, this evidence can be interpreted as varying preferences for women with high labor market integration due to exposure to certain sexual stereotypes early in life.

For the maturity effect, we find evidence for a very weak presence in the pre 9/11 period and no presence in the post 9/11 period, indicating that the maturity effect vanishes completely following the event of 9/11. Despite a strong presence of the volume effect in both periods, we detect a relative decrease in the presence during the post 9/11 period. The open interest effect shows a very weak presence during the pre 9/11 period and a strong presence during the post 9/11 period, indicating a stronger open interest effect following the event of 9/11.

Findings show that the defining trait of PIIGS countries is neither budget deficits, nor public debt, but rather the current account deficits (http://ideas.repec.org/a/oen/econom/y2012i03id332.html). The politicians' initial assumption that joining the Eurozone would lead to the convergence of productivity trends failed to materialize. We argue that, while tightening fiscal discipline within the Eurozone is a must, it does not solve the problem of lack of competitiveness. Adopting rules on capping structural deficits at around 0.5 percent of GDP might prove premature, given the private sector deleveraging process. We reveal the solutions that help exit the crisis without deepening the recession. Among them, a weaker euro would buy time for countries facing a competitiveness deficit to implement far-reaching structural reforms conducive to higher labor productivity.

Financial shocks, exacerbating the distortion generated by the debt-deflation channel, provide a rational for an interest-rate response to the price-level. Indeed, a price-level targeting rule reduces the trade-off between the nominal debt distortion and the inefficiency generated by nominal price stickiness.

This introduces more complexity in the pricing and optimal management of swing contracts. This paper is devoted to a proper quantitative modelization of one type of make-up clause in a gas swing contract. More in detail, we succeed in building an algorithm to price and optimally manage the make-up gas allocation among the years and the gas taking in the swing subperiods within the years: we prove that this problem has a quadratic complexity with respect to the number of years. The algorithm can be adapted to different instances of make-up clauses as well as to some forms of carry-forward clauses. Then, as an example, we show the algorithm at work on a 3-year contract and we present a sensitivity analysis of the price and of the make-up policy with respect to various parameters relative both to the price dynamics and to the swing contract. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that such a quantitative treatment of make-up clauses appears in literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We speak of social interactions if the same subject at the same time makes group-specific decisions that depend on their respective neighbors' decisions.

This article focuses on a widespread, but little studied, feature of this environment-the role of intermediaries (pimps or brothel owners) on market outcomes. Prostitution laws and markets are perhaps unique in that transactions between principals (prostitutes and johns) are legal in many countries, while intermediary activity (pimping) is illegal. After surveying the varying cross-country legality of agents we develop a simple theoretical model to analyze how the presence or absence of intermediaries shifts the distribution of market surplus. We show that eliminating pimps and brothels may shift surplus in non-obvious ways, depending on the precise function they perform and on whether equilibrium is pooling or separating across high quality and low quality market segments. The implications of alternative policy regimes (intermediaries legal or illegal) are considered.","[Farmer, Amy; Horowitz, Andrew W.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Farmer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Room 402,Business Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",afarmer@walton.uark.edu; horowitz@walton.uark.edu,,,,,,,23,15,20,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

From the originates a plethora of IC measurement methods and tools have been proposed. Although there is a strong belief in the possibilities of using measurements for managing organizations (Catasus, et al., 2007), both academics and practitioners have questioned IC measurements potential in practice (Dumay, 2009; Guthrie, et al., 2012). Stemming from this and considering the call for case studies on Intellectual Capital in practice (Dumay, 2009; Guthrie, et al., 2012), the purpose of this study is to investigate IC from an accounting change perspective. In order to achieve this aim, three research questions will lead this analysis: 1) To what extent is it possible to talk about IC as an accounting change? 2) Which logic of change can the implementation of an IC accounting system (ICAS) follow? 3) Which management approach can the implementation of an ICAS follow? This study is based on a field study developed adopting an action research approach. These are the main results. First, IC can lead to a technical and to a substantial change. While new measurements always bring technical innovations, after the introduction of an ICAS pre-existing measurements can assume different meaning. Second, IC accounting change seems to be linear from a technical perspective but the use of the ICAS can have unexpected managerial effects. Third, when IC is introduced from an accounting perspective, the focus is on the measurement of IC. Nevertheless, this situation can change and the focus can be moved to another perspective such as the managerial one.","Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Management, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Giuliani, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Management, Ancona, Italy.",m.giuliani@univpm.it,"GIULIANI, MARCO/ABF-2162-2021","GIULIANI, MARCO/0000-0002-0194-8616",,,,,42,1,1,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,174,181,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000020,0

However, using micro estimates to predict aggregate demand responses to policy changes may also create a bias if not aggregated properly. This may sound like a Catch 22 situation, but it is not, as it is possible to calculate both micro and aggregate demand responses based on microdata. The size of the aggregation bias is an empirical question. In this article, we show how to calculate theoretically consistent aggregate demand responses. We use both micro and macro data for Norwegian household electricity consumption to illustrate the magnitude and direction of different aggregation biases.

The scientific problem of this research can be formulated by raising the issue as follows: how does the economic development in Lithuania influences the most vulnerable labour market segments? To tackle the problem, scientific literature analysis, statistical clustering and comparison, and correlation and regression analysis methods are used. Statistical relations between country's overall level of employment and the number of unemployed among the most vulnerable segments of the labour market shows that the growth of the employment rate has a strong statistical tendency to decrease the number of unemployed among the most vulnerable segments of the labour market. Analogous analysis of the data revealed that when the unemployment rate increases, the unemployment rate of the most vulnerable segments of the labour market also increases. The research results show that the changes of employment and unemployment rate of the most vulnerable segments of the labour market in the country can be predicted with high reliability. This discloses the potential of practical applicability of the model. In order to monitor the employment of the most vulnerable segments of the labour market, there is a need to analyze constantly the impact of economic changes on the employment of these segments.","[Jakstiene, Sandra; Purvinis, Ojaras; Susniene, Dalia] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Jakstiene, S (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Nemuno Str 33, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania.",sandra.jakstiene@ktu.lt; ojaras.purvinis@ktu.lt; dalia.susniene@ktu.lt,"Susniene, Dalia/A-1626-2016","Susniene, Dalia/0000-0003-1639-7180",,,,,37,3,3,0,5,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this paper we decompose the net inflow into four rather than two components. We show that the four-way decomposition provides a better understanding of six recent financial crises and predicts sudden stops better than a standard two-way decomposition. We conclude that four-way decompositions can be more informative than either the net capital inflow or two-way decompositions of the net inflow. (C) 2012 Society for Policy Modeling.

It states that in order to reduce poverty and inequality, current social policy should be reformed, and the current income support (or income security) policy should be replaced by the asset-based policy which stresses the development of skills, knowledge and capabilities, promotes savings, investments and building of assets and gives everyone a possibility to become a capital owner. The paper presents results of a representative survey which was aimed to explore Lithuanian inhabitants' opinion towards the new form of social policy: asset-based policy.

Specifically, it shows that using the aggregate Cost of Living (COL) estimates for the entire households as is commonly practiced would produce noticeable group bias effect in measurement. Also the magnitude of the commodity substitution bias in the conventional Consumer Price Index (CPI) is found to be positively related to household income in general. Because of the presence of these two biases, the true COL for households belonging to the two ends of the income spectrum is found to be over-estimated.

While there is consensus among most economists that auctions are the preferred assignment mechanism, the assignment mode is split, more or less, equally (in terms of the number of licences issued) between administrative allocations and auctions. With auction procedures tending to raise more revenue for governments (Cartelier, 2003) the question that naturally arises is: why are administrative allocations so popular a method to assign spectrum? McMillan (1995) conjectures that administrative allocations provide additional 'flexibility'. Accordingly, this study examines the performance of 3G assignments in terms of an econometric analysis of a unique sample of national 3G spectrum administrative allocations.

Critics consider it a deregulation of the labour market, decreasing investment in human capital and innovation. We contribute to this broad debate providing an estimate of the relationships linking innovative investment, substitution investment, permanent hires and temporary hires. In particular, we aim at affirming or denying that innovative investments are accompanied by a specific kind of workforce, being it stable or flexible. In doing so, we contribute to bridge the gap among two quite separate strands of literature, as existing literature usually analyses capital and labour separately. Estimating a nonlinear recursive equation system we highlight a significant increase in the likelihood of hiring on a permanent base when the firm innovates; this holds till 2008. Afterward, during the crisis, innovating firms are more likely to hire using temporary contracts instead, a possible signal of a cost saving strategy adopted in a loose labour market by firms still able to innovate. Furthermore, both permanent and temporary hires never depend on increases in labour costs; however, substitution investment increases when labour cost increases, maybe in an attempt to increase labour productivity through a more efficient capital equipment.","[Pacelli, Lia] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Publ Finance, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Malgarini, Marco; Mancini, Massimo] ISTAT, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Turin,"Pacelli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Publ Finance, Cso Unione Soviet 218, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",lia.pacelli@unito.it,"Malgarini, Marco/A-5265-2015; Malgarini, Marco/AAB-3130-2019","Malgarini, Marco/0000-0001-9553-5435; Malgarini, Marco/0000-0001-9553-5435",,,,,27,12,12,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, we study how households behave when they are uncertain about future Medicare policies. Medicare represents the main form of insurance against medical expenditure risk for older Americans. However, the challenge raised by the Medicare budget increases households' awareness of possible future Medicare reforms. Households are uncertain about the types and timing of those reforms. To analyze the effects of that policy uncertainty, we build a life-cycle model where households face several risks. Based on reasonable assumptions about policy uncertainty, we find that, due to that uncertainty, households mainly increase savings, with older households saving up to 3.5% more in the short run. The average welfare loss is about $10,000 in wealth-equivalent, with the largest losses concentrated among older households.","[Santoro, Marika] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Michelangeli, Valentina] Bank Italy, I-00184 Rome, Italy",International Monetary Fund; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Santoro, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",MSantoro@imf.org,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

There are firm theoretical reasons, however, to believe that qualitative differences in migration began as early as the 1980s, owing to the widening distribution of earnings and the related increased returns to education in the United States relative to Canada, both of which could result in qualitative improvements in the migration flow. US immigration policy remained essentially unchanged during the 1980s, but changed markedly in the 1990s owing to the implementation of the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA) and its successor, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). We use a flexible empirical approach to document these changes in immigrant quality using 1980, 1990 and 2000 US census data. Our results suggest that improvements in Canadian immigrant quality occurred during the 1990s, but these also happened earlier, casting doubt on the hypothesis of improving Canadian immigrant quality in the 1990s. Quantile regressions also show that improvement in the entry quality of immigrants was not limited to the upper tail of the earnings distribution.","Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Lethbridge,"Mueller, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",richard.mueller@uleth.ca,"Mueller, Richard E/W-9054-2018","Mueller, Richard E/0000-0001-6749-0348",,,,,24,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In contrast to marriages among whites, African marriages in South Africa traditionally have involved the payment of bridewealth (or ilobolo) by a husband to the prospective wife's family. Using matched data from the 2001 Population Census and the South African Labour Force Surveys, we find that among Africans, both the quantity and quality of unmarried men relative to women in local marriage markets are significant predictors of marriage. However, economic-based measures of marriageability have a larger effect on marriage outcomes than simple sex ratios. These findings are consistent with the argument that bridewealth payments act as a financial constraint to marriage among African couples, raising the marriageability criteria of men. In contrast, we find mostly insignificant results for the relationship between sex ratios and marriage outcomes among white women.","[Posel, Dorrit; Casale, Daniela] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Dev Studies, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Posel, D (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Dev Studies, King George V Ave, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa.",posel@ukzn.ac.za,"Casale, Daniela/HTL-3497-2023; Posel, Dorrit/AAF-7750-2021","Casale, Daniela/0000-0003-1337-1196; Posel, Dorrit/0000-0002-3343-875X",,,,,30,21,22,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Part of this redefinition of universities roles is based on the three mission heuristic, namely that HEIs' contribution to economic and social development is carried out by engaging (1) teaching (2) research (3) interaction with socio-economic environment. The traditional view does not explain in detail if and how the three missions are related to one another, and that the growth of one is implicitly suggests the beneficial for the others. The present paper challenges this perspective and takes the view that university missions are constructs connected by complex relationships. In so doing, we make two contributions to the literature: first we explore the connection between the theoretical rationale of university missions, and second we assess the complementarity among missions. Our empirical study on Spanish public universities corroborates this hypothesis by finding complementarity between research (2nd mission) and interaction with the socioeconomic environment (3rd mission), and substitutability between the former and teaching (1st mission). The paper calls for a critical reflection of university engagements with the missions: rethinking whether all higher education institutions should be simultaneously developing all three missions may be vital to ensuring their contribution to the socio-economic development of regions.","INGENIO CSIC UPV Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Sánchez-Barrioluengo, M (通讯作者)，INGENIO CSIC UPV Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",msbarrioluengo@ingenio.upv.es,"Barrioluengo, Mabel Sánchez/AAB-1211-2019","Barrioluengo, Mabel Sánchez/0000-0002-6241-030X",,,,,52,1,2,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,564,572,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000065,0

Specialists of quality management determined that quality costs make a big part of total factor costs, taking about 30 % (Srivastava, 2008). Reducing of quality costs allows reducing of total organizational costs that would result in reducing of price of goods manufactured or services supplied, increase of customers' satisfaction or improved organization performance (Juran, 1951; Crosby, 1979; Heagy, 1991; Tsai, 1998; Moen, 1998; Malchi & McGurk, 2001; Prickett & Rapley, 2001; Love & Irani, 2003; Tannock & Saelem, 2007; Sower, Quarles & Broussard, 2007; Wu et al., 2011). Organizations that have prepared the programs of quality costs accounting adapted to their specific activity and paying more attention to implementation of quality programs, can identify, set in underlying order, evaluate and select quality investments more easy (Bottorff, 1997). Also quality costs programs allow calculation of return of investment to quality, help to find out how development is going (Gray, 1995), determine where highest costs appear and allow to find out what is the loss due to poor quality (Bottorff, 1997). Unfortunately, many organizations don't know their quality costs (Yang, 2008). Between the reasons determining the absence of quality costs accounting in the organization, following are indicated: use of many types of different accounting systems (Harry & Schroeder, 2000), traditional costs accounting systems are not adapted to identify quality costs data (Chiadamrong, 2003), lack of adequate methods to determine the results of poor quality (Chen & Yang, 2002). Studies performed by Viger & Anandarajan (1999) show that organizations that are calculating and analyzing quality costs, are making efficient decisions more often than those not calculating quality costs. Having calculated the loss due to poor quality and determined where its appearance is the largest, organizations can make decisions allowing optimization of quality costs. While optimizing quality costs, benefit increases (Fine & Charles, 1986; Freiesleben, 2005). Also, optimization of quality costs is a condition necessary to survive and anchor in the market. Quality costs programs were implemented and used worldwide (Carr, 1992; Schiffauerova & Thomson, 2006a). However, both the scientific literature and enterprises' practice still are having questions how to calculate all constituents of categories of quality costs in details in striving for maximal benefit from the system of accounting of quality costs. In the article there is discussion about the problems of quality costs accounting in striving for detailed calculation of all quality costs, a problem of lack of hidden failure quality costs accounting methodology analyzed, a review of literature on quality costs accounting models presented, the studies performed by other authors discussed, suggestions how to calculate hidden failure quality costs presented. An empirical study was performed in Lithuanian organization where methodology of accounting of constituents of hidden failure quality costs was tested.","[Snieska, Vytautas; Daunoriene, Asta; Zekeviciene, Alma] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Snieska, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.snieska@ktu.lt; asta.daunoriene@ktu.lt; alma.zekeviciene@ktu.lt,"Snieska, Vytautas/S-2053-2017","Snieska, Vytautas/0000-0001-8777-273X",,,,,71,27,31,9,58,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Since the owners know more about the patents than potential external financiers, there is a problem of asymmetric information. To overcome this, Sweden has for a long time relied on government support rather than Private Venture Capital (PVC). In the empirical analysis, two kinds of government loans are unbundled. The empirical results show that patents which have received soft government loans in the R&D-phase have a higher probability of expiring than patents without such financing. But patents that have received more market-oriented government loans during the commercialization phase are renewed for as long as other commercialized patents. This finding suggests that rather than bad choices of projects, it is the nature of the contract terms that explains the low renewal of some patents with government financing.","Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Svensson, R (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",roger.svensson@ifn.se,,"Svensson, Roger/0000-0003-3377-8460",,,,,51,15,17,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Welfare gains are defined as the difference between the value of a QALY gained by innovative pharmaceuticals and their costs. The review shows that there are systematic differences among pharmaceutical policies and regulations between countries. It is further found that the welfare gains of pharmaceuticals are substantial and amount to (sic)77 per capita per year in the Netherlands.

We find that high quality cigars are more likely to be recommended to more experienced cigar lovers. Both the self-assessed quality and recommendation depend on the length and diameter of the cigars, but also on more subjective characteristics like number and type of aromas. Results from a Fields' decomposition show that the quality of cigars is much more sensitive to the presence of a defect and number of aromas than the experts' recommendation, which is more influenced by the rarity of cigars. Finally, it is essentially the cigars' objective characteristics that have an influence on their prices, meaning that consumers truly benefit from additional qualitative information when reading experts' advice and ratings.","[Vaillant, Nicolas Gerard] CNRS, LEM, UMR 8179, F-59016 Lille, France; [Vaillant, Nicolas Gerard] Univ Catholique Lille, FLSEG Ctr Rech Capital Humain, F-59016 Lille, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, F-44322 Nantes, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] CNAV, Paris, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] INED, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Universite Catholique de Lille; Nantes Universite,"Vaillant, NG (通讯作者)，CNRS, LEM, UMR 8179, 60 Bd Vauban,BP109, F-59016 Lille, France.",nicolas.vaillant@icl-lille.fr,,"Vaillant, Nicolas/0000-0002-0201-7426",,,,,26,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on an analytical framework of decision making of migrant workers, two fundamental hypotheses are proposed: on one hand, the better enterprise-internal working environment has a positive impact on decision making of less job mobility; on the other hand, the better external social environment has a positive impact on the decision of job stability as well. Accordingly, the paper uses empirically a multinomial logit model to analyze the determinants to the decision-making of migrant workers on employment choice based on the field survey in the Pearl River Delta of China. The main empirical findings are as follows: in terms of individual characteristics, those migrant workers who are young or single, or possess a higher degree of education may be more likely to choose job hopping. In particular, a higher level of schooling facilitates increasing the probability of switching jobs by about 14.5%. Second, those migrants who carry the heavy burden of looking after the elderly or children are more likely to job hop. Third, those who have low earnings or those in relatively worse living conditions are more likely to choose job hopping. Finally, some factors of external social environment also make a significant impact on the decision-making of job switching.","[Wang, Chunchao] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chunchao] Jinan Univ, Inst Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guifu] Xiamen Univ, Ctr Macroecon Res, Sch Econ, MOE Key Lab Econometr,Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yarong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Jinan; University of Jinan; Xiamen University; Renmin University of China,"Chen, GF (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Ctr Macroecon Res, Sch Econ, MOE Key Lab Econometr,Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",,"Wang, Chun-Chao/I-5691-2012; Chen, Guifu/HLW-1465-2023",,,,,,49,2,2,1,42,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The way out of unemployment does not have to be just finding a new job, but also business. However, people often have fear of entering the sphere of business. They have fear of the risks associated with business, they don't have the necessary finance, they lack experience and are discouraged by the excessive administration associated with it. And most importantly, important information connected with business is not readily available and people do not even know where to access it The aim of the survey was to determine the level of awareness and interest In various support schemes and the scale of willingness to tackle unemployment by means of entry into the business world. For this purpose, we used various statistical methods to verify the relationships between the observed aspects and to find factors influencing people's decision to start a business. It was found that awareness of the aid offered is very low. Individual supports are not very widespread. It was also found that most people do not consider entrepreneurship as an alternative to a Job in dealing with unemployment. On the other hand, it was found that most of the existing small business owners are more or less satisfied with their situation, and that do not regret their decision to start a business.","[Zambochova, Marta] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Math & Informat, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,,marta.zambochova@ujep.cz,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,642,651,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300068,0

We show that, when social ties in a community enhance borrowers' incentives to exert effort, a profit-maximizing financier chooses a group of limited size. Borrowers that would be fundable under moral hazard but have insufficient social ties do not receive funding. The result arises because there is a trade-off between raising profits through increased group size and providing incentives for borrowers with less social ties. The result may explain why many micro-lending institutions and rural credit cooperatives lend to groups of small size. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Responders can accept or reject the proposal, with game types differing in the consequences of rejection: all four combinations of (not) self-harming and (not) other-harming are considered. We find that envy leads responders to reject high proposer claims, especially when rejection harms the proposer. Notwithstanding, maximal claims by proposers are predominant for all game types.

As the consumption level of ethnic goods increases, the migrants become ever more different to the local population and are less assimilated. Less assimilation affects the reaction of the local population to the migrants and their willingness to accept the newcomers. This social phenomenon and affects wages and unemployment. We show that the growth in the unemployment and social benefits of legal migrants increases the consumption of ethnic goods, thus creating a trap wherein the willingness of the local population to accept the migrants into the economy decreases. This process also increases the probability of the migrants' dependence on the welfare state.

These results support the view that constitutional limits to deficit appear favourable to long term employment, particularly if the balance of the budget is obtained limiting the size of Government.","[Fedeli, Silvia; Forte, Francesco] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Econ & Diritto, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Fedeli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Econ & Diritto, Via Castro Laureanziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",silvia.fedeli@uniroma1.it; francesco.forte@uniroma1.it,,"FEDELI, SILVIA/0000-0002-2281-9856",,,,,58,1,2,0,18,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We find that consumption and labor income are weakly exogenous in the estimated reduced form model and show that this imposes restrictions on the structural model. These restrictions imply that the structural shock with transitory effects can only appear in the structural equation for wealth. One of our structural models yields two permanent shocks that are identical to those obtained by Lettau and Ludvigson (2011) using the method of Gonzalo and Ng (2001). Following Lettau and Ludvigson we interpret the shocks as a productivity shock and a reallocation shock. The reallocation shock has an inverse effect on labor income and wealth, but has little effect on consumption, a result that is consistent with the permanent income hypothesis. Using an alternative restriction - which allows consumption growth to respond to contemporaneous labor income growth - to identify the two permanent shocks produces one important difference in our results. The reallocation shock now has a pronounced effect on consumption, a finding that can be explained if a sizable proportion of consumers are liquidity constrained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

With tax competition between governments, we allow for welfare-maximizing governments in the two countries to delegate tax setting responsibility to policy-makers who have different objectives than the governments. The unique equilibrium in the tax competition environment involves both governments delegating tax setting responsibility to tax revenue-maximizing policy-makers. This equilibrium yields higher welfare for both countries than the outcome when the governments delegate to welfare-maximizing policy-makers. The paper also compares tax competition with tax harmonization and shows that when the entire export market is served, tax harmonization improves the welfare of the country that houses the low cost firm, while the other country may be immiserized.","[Mohan, Vijay] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia; [Hazari, Bharat] City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Deakin University; City University of Hong Kong,"Hazari, B (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bhazari@gmail.com,,"Mohan, Vijay/0000-0001-6339-6645",,,,,19,1,1,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Through the analysis of Hayek's work, the article contributes to further consolidating the view that neoliberalism is an ideological project of institutional transformation which, despite some enduring myths, has an irreplaceable role for a state with many important functions in a more limited democracy. Markets, for their part, are politically contested social constructions that depend on previous non-market institutions for their existence and legitimation.

We study a large sample of European firms and also find little evidence of binding finance constraints when we estimate standard investment-cash flow regressions. However, we find strong evidence that the availability of finance matters for R&D once we directly control for: (i) firm efforts to smooth R&D with cash reserves and (ii) firm use of external equity finance. Our study provides a framework for evaluating financing constraints when firms rely extensively on external finance and endogenously manage buffer stocks of liquidity to keep investment smooth, and our findings show that controlling for this smoothing behavior is critical for uncovering the full effect of financing constraints. Our findings also indicate a major role for external equity in financing R&D, highlighting a causal channel through which stock market development and liberalization can promote economic growth by increasing firm-level innovative activity.

After the studies of requirements set in Latvia concerning the recognition and accounting of investment property it was established that it is permitted to carry out the evaluation and accounting of these assets, after their initial recognition, according to several methods. Thus in Latvia, as well as at the international level the problem is which accounting policy should be chosen for the evaluation and accounting of investment property. The aim of the research is to perform the comparative analysis of accounting policy adopted in Latvia and internationally regarding the investment property and to develop suggestions for its improvement. The research methodology is based on the comparative analysis of the requirements set in the documents regulating accounting in Latvia, the European Union Directives regulating accounting and the International Accounting Standards. The paper covers also the analysis of authors' conclusions, publications in the periodicals, the results of the survey of the members of the Accountants' Association of the Republic of Latvia, and other bibliographic sources. The authors of the research draw a conclusion that there had been several requirements set in the documents regulating accounting in Latvia, which only partially comply with the regulations adopted internationally regarding the recognition, evaluation and accounting of investment property. At the end of research, the authors have developed suggestions for the improvement of investment property accounting policy in Latvia.","[Bulmane, Inga; Kasale, Maiga] Univ Latvia, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Bûlmane, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Aspazijas Blvd 5-434, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.",inga.bumane@lu.lv; Mkassale@lanet.lv,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,12,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The predicted effects include inefficiency, a decrease in the seller's revenue, and higher bidders' payoffs. Under risk neutrality, the members of the strong party benefit less than the weak bidders. The prediction is reversed when the bidders are sufficiently risk-averse. These hypotheses are tested experimentally. Contrary to the theory, joint bidding increases efficiency and the seller's revenue decreases by less than expected. Strong bidders benefit more than weak bidders indicating that incentives to bid jointly may be greater than hypothesized. Additionally, the experiment assesses the effect of group decision-making.

This makes a direct rather than indirect examination of Sraffa's philosophical thinking possible, and also shifts the focus from his relationship to Wittgenstein to his own thinking per se. I suggest that the previous focus, necessary as it may have been prior to the availability of the unpublished materials, involved some distortion of Sraffa's thinking by virtue of its framing in terms of Wittgenstein's concerns as reflected in the concerns of scholars primarily interested in the change in his thinking. This paper seeks to locate these early convictions in this historical context, and then go on to treat the development of Sraffa's philosophical thinking as a process beginning from this point, arguing that his thinking underwent one significant shift around 1931, but still retained its early key assumptions. Thus the approach I will take to Sraffa's philosophical thinking is to explain it as a process of development largely within a single framework defined by his view of how modern science determines the scope and limits upon economic theorising.","[Davis, John B.] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Davis, John B.] Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Amsterdam; Marquette University,"Davis, JB (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, PO 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",john.davis@marquette.edu,,,,,,,38,12,13,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We develop a theoretical model with multiple, ex ante identical jurisdictions where individuals decide on education and subsequent emigration. Migration decisions are based on differences in net income across jurisdictions which may occur endogenously. The interaction between income differences and migration flows gives rise to the potential of multiple equilibria: a symmetric equilibrium without migration and an asymmetric equilibrium in which net income levels differ among jurisdictions and trigger migration flows. In the former equilibrium, all jurisdictions have the same public investment level. In the latter one, public investment is high in host economies of skilled expatriates and low in source economies. We empirically test the hypothesis that emigration rates are negatively associated with publicly financed investment levels for OECD countries.","[Stadelmann, David] Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Grossmann, Volker] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Grossmann, Volker] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Fribourg; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Stadelmann, D (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, Bd Perolles 90,F408, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",volker.grossmann@unifr.ch; david.stadelmann@unifr.ch,"Stadelmann, David/I-1116-2019","Stadelmann, David/0000-0002-1211-9936; Grossmann, Volker/0000-0001-8917-3503",,,,,24,1,1,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Also, it leads to reduced wage inequality between the North and the South and a higher utility for the Southern consumers in the steady state. Second, we show that a tariff imposition in the North has no effect on the long-run growth rate, but it causes a temporary increase in the innovation rate and a permanent decrease in the imitation rate.

This popular format entails increased opportunities for coordination among bidders, since bids are observable and can be used as signaling. This has happened, e.g., in the Netherlands 3G Telecom Auction and in the FCC auctions. While it may seem that such bidding harms economic efficiency, we show that side communication may actually improve efficiency: We describe an ex-post subgame-perfect equilibrium, with limited communication, that is ex-post efficient. In contrast, without communication, we show that there is no ex-post equilibrium which is ex-post efficient in this auction. In this equilibrium, bidders initially report true demands, and then perform a single demand reduction at a certain point, determined using a single message exchanged between the bidders. This limited signaling opportunity resolves the strategic problems of myopic bidding, and may improve the social welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We find substantial asymmetry when retailers pass on the impact of price changes in the wholesale market to the retail prices as price increases are transmitted more quickly than price decreases. By examining the cumulative adjustment function of price change, we identify that some dominant retailers might be exercising market power in the retail electricity market. For an average Norwegian household with variable price contract, the cost of asymmetric price pass-through due to 2.5 Ore/kWh change in the wholesale price over the complete life of pass-through in a year reaches to a high of 2.28 NOK. This cost sums up to 3.8 million NOK for all the Norwegian households on variable price contracts for one time price change.

However, partners in intimate relationships may often need to coordinate their choices in the face of incomplete information. To reduce uncertainty there is an incentive for partners to acquire information through communication. In this study we investigate empirically the determinants of communication between partners and its consequences in the specific context of sexual satisfaction. In particular we show the importance of schooling for information acquisition effort. Although education indirectly improves sexual satisfaction through the communication mechanism, we also find direct adverse effects of schooling on sexual wellbeing. This is interpreted in terms of opportunity cost effect arising from the market returns to schooling that make it more difficult to coordinate work and love lives. The econometric estimates show that the positive communication effects of education vanish at longer relationship durations as couples learn about their preferences. While sexual satisfaction is positively correlated with life satisfaction, it is only when controlling for sexual wellbeing that schooling has a statistically signification association with overall life satisfaction.","[Rainer, Helmut] Univ Munich, CESifo, Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Smith, Ian] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",Ifo Institut; University of Munich; University of St Andrews,"Rainer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, CESifo, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",rainer@ifo.de; is@st-and.ac.uk,,"Smith, Ian/0000-0002-4795-056X; Rainer, Helmut/0000-0003-1181-2568",,,,,35,23,28,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2012,65.0,4,,,,,581,598,,10.1111/kykl.12007,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,026AT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310241200008,0

We present a stochastic two-stage optimisation model that captures the multistage nature of transmission planning under uncertainty and use it to evaluate interregional grid reinforcements in Great Britain (GB). In our model, a proactive transmission planner makes investment decisions in two time periods, each time followed by a market response. Uncertainty is represented by economic, technology, and regulatory scenarios, and first-stage investments must be made before it is known which scenario will occur. The model allows us to identify expected cost-minimising first-stage investments, as well as estimate the value of information, the cost of ignoring uncertainty, and the value of flexibility. Our results show that ignoring risk in planning transmission for renewables has quantifiable economic consequences, and that considering uncertainty can yield decisions that have lower expected costs than traditional deterministic planning methods. In the GB case, the value of information and cost of disregarding uncertainty in transmission planning were of the same order of magnitude (approximately E100 M, in present worth terms). Further, the best plan under a risk-neutral decision criterion can differ from the best under risk-aversion. Finally, a traditional sensitivity analysis-based robustness analysis also yields different results than the stochastic model, although the former's expected cost is not much higher.

To approach these distributional questions we rely on the Atkinson, Kolm, Sen (hereafter AKS) methodology, which defines a multidimensional inequality index consistent with the Pigou-Dalton principle. This index can be decomposed into univariate indexes belonging to the class of AKS indexes, and a residual term accounting for the interaction across dimensions. The empirical application investigates the evolution of inequality in well-being across some EU countries between 1994 and 2001. Since the multidimensional index depends on the values assigned to the parameters, we test the sensitivity of the trend in well-being to the degree of inequality aversion on each dimension. Our empirical results summarize the evolution of inequality for the indicators of well-being considered both separately and jointly, over time and across countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Methods for estimating dynamic programming models with unobserved heterogeneity are extended to account for unexpected policy interventions and endogenous sample selection and initial conditions. Parameters are identified and consistently estimated by imposing optimal responses to the exact form of the SSP earnings supplement and the experimental program, which induces exogenous variation between treatment groups and within groups as treatment progresses. The estimated model tracks primary outcomes well in and out of sample, except for underestimating trends in the sample of new welfare applicants.

Consequently, home-owners accept job offers from other cities at a lower rate than do renters, generating a link between home-ownership and unemployment both at the city level and in the aggregate. When calibrated to match aggregate U.S. statistics on mobility, housing, and labour flows, the model predicts that the effect of home-ownership on aggregate unemployment is small.

The lower bound of this elasticity is estimated to be -1.8 for males and -3.6 for females. Additional findings suggest that this wage elasticity differs by the type of care provided to elderly parents and that it is larger in magnitude among individuals with siblings and those with independently living parents.

We find supportive evidence for an increase in the ITR on labor income in the EU15, but no effect on the ITR on capital income. There is evidence of convergence in terms of the ITR on consumption, as countries with higher than average ITR on consumption respond to globalization by decreasing their tax rates. There are important differences among the welfare regimes within the EU15. Social-democratic countries have decreased the tax burden on capital, but increased that on labor due to globalization. Globalization exerts a pressure to increase taxes on labor income in the conservative and liberal regimes as well. Taxes on consumption decrease in response to globalization in the conservative and social-democratic regimes. In the CEE NMS, there is no effect of globalization on the ITR on labor and capital income, but we find a negative impact on the ITR on consumption in the CEE NMS with higher than average ITR on consumption.

There is increasing awareness, however, that such mechanisms might fail to ensure effective participation by all stakeholders and be prone to producing and/or perpetuating power inequalities. Against this backdrop, we claim that opower' should be positioned at the centre of analyses of natural resource management. In this paper we provide a taxonomy of positions to analyse participatory decision making in natural resource management. We operationalise this framework to analyse two ofailures' of participatory natural resource management in Turkey, focusing on reasons for failure and the role of power asymmetries. Our results are based on case studies comprising in-depth interviews, focus groups and a survey administered to 944 individuals.

On the basis of this framework it is argued that it was primarily the weakening of the inducements to invest that improved the attractiveness of financial investments, rather than the other way round. The overall effect on investment of financial sector enlargement was negative, but for the reason that it contributed to bring about a change in income distribution unfavourable to the expansion of demand, while permitting only a temporary disconnection of demand from the distributive change. The reader's attention is then drawn to the element of continuity that can be detected between the current European economic policy of austerity and the process of substitution of loans for wages experienced by a large section of advanced capitalism up to the 2007 crisis. The article concludes on the question of long-run social stability within advanced capitalism.","[Barba, Aldo] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Pivetti, Massimo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Sapienza University Rome,"Barba, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.",,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,4,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

If financial soundness is not perfectly observable, then financially weaker contractors are selected with higher probability in any incentive compatible mechanism. Informational rents are associated with the probability of default. By selecting the financially weakest contractor, stronger price competition (auctions) may not only increase the probability of default but also the contractors' expected rents.

The two most widely used models of conditional covariances and correlations in the class of multivariate GARCH models are BEKK and dynamic conditional correlation (DCC). It is well known that BEKK suffers from the archetypal curse of dimensionality, whereas DCC does not. It is argued in this paper that this is a misleading interpretation of the suitability of the two models for use in practice. The primary purpose of this paper is to analyse the similarities and dissimilarities between BEKK and DCC, both with and without targeting, on the basis of the structural derivation of the models, the availability of analytical forms for the sufficient conditions for existence of moments, sufficient conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the appropriate estimators and computational tractability for ultra large numbers of financial assets. Based on theoretical considerations, the paper sheds light on how to discriminate between BEKK and DCC in practical applications.","[Caporin, Massimiliano] Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy; [McAleer, Michael] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [McAleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Padua; Kyoto University; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Caporin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; Caporin, Massimiliano/AAM-5958-2020","Caporin, Massimiliano/0000-0001-5014-5951",,,,,32,105,107,2,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Decisions regarding fertility and labor market participation are interrelated and depend on individual and household characteristics, as well as external variables such as the availability of childcare services. We postulate that a female's decision to leave the labor market is taken in a household context, and thus is the outcome which maximizes household welfare after taking into account the employment and earnings characteristics of all household members. We pay special attention to the effect of the male partner's characteristics upon the female's decision to withdraw from the labor market.

It shows that cross-ownership is profitable to the private firm only if the level of privatization of the public firm is sufficiently high. In equilibrium, cross-ownership does not take place even if there is partial privatization. However, the possibility of cross-ownership significantly limits the socially optimal level of privatization in most of the situations. Moreover, it demonstrates that full nationalization is socially optimal, in case of sufficiently convex identical cost functions and homogeneous goods. These results have strong implications to both divestment and competition policies.","[Jain, Ritika; Pal, Rupayan] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res IGIDR, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India",,"Pal, R (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res IGIDR, Film City Rd,Gen AK Vaidya Marg, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",ritikajain@igidr.ac.in; rupayan@igidr.ac.in,"Pal, Rupayan/AAU-4717-2021; Pal, Rupayan/AAN-7062-2021; Pal, Rupayan/AAF-4646-2020","Pal, Rupayan/0000-0002-9475-2179;",,,,,45,45,47,2,64,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

To promote small farmers' access to the commercialized agrofood market, membership in farmer professional economic cooperatives (FPCs) is considered to be an important strategy by the Chinese leaders. The goals of this study are to investigate the marketing of FPCs in China and to determine their record of food safety compliance. Based on 157 FPCs from a nearly national representative survey, this paper shows that marketing FPCs in China relies primarily on the wholesale market, but there is a notable penetration of the modern supply chain via FPCs. Government-driven agribusiness facilitates farmers' access to markets via FPCs. However, food safety standards are not well-specified in the current FPCs' marketing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We determined world-wide carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trends and six underlying forces driving emissions from the industry sector with production-based decomposition from 1990 to 2006. We also conducted a cross-country analysis in order to identify each country's technical potential for improving its CO2 intensity. Our model provides more detailed information about the influence of both production technical efficiency and technological change on CO2 emissions and we show that the relative degree of each country's energy efficiency paradox phenomenon can be identified empirically. As a result, trends show that economic activity change has been the dominant contributor to the growth of CO2 emissions while changes in potential energy intensity and energy mix have led to emission reduction in almost all OECD and non-OECD countries. In the impacts of production technology (i.e., technical efficiency and technological change), the study reveals mixed results but generally shows that OECD countries diffuse their production technologies more efficiently than do non-OECD countries. From emission mitigation potentials, we also identified that many OECD and non-OECD countries have demonstrated a reduced potential for mitigation over time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Exxon spill ignited a debate about the appropriate compensation for damages suffered, and among economists, a debate concerning the adequacy of methods to value public goods, particularly when the good in question has limited direct use, such as the pristine natural environment of the spill region. The efficacy of stated preference methods generally, and contingent valuation in particular, is no mere academic debate. Billions of dollars are at stake. An influential symposium appearing in this journal in 1994 provided arguments for and against the credibility of these methods, and an extensive research program published in academic journals has continued to this day. This paper assesses what occurred in this academic literature between the Exxon spill and the BP disaster. We will rely on theoretical developments, neoclassical and behavioral paradigms, empirical and experimental evidence, and a clearer elucidation of validity criteria to provide a framework for readers to ponder the question of the validity of contingent valuation and, more generally, stated preference methods.","[Kling, Catherine L.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Phaneuf, Daniel J.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA; [Zhao, Jinhua] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Iowa State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Michigan State University,"Kling, CL (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ckling@iastate.edu; dphaneuf@wisc.edu; jzhao@msu.edu,"Zhao, Jinhua/GYV-4433-2022","Kling, Catherine L/0000-0002-4785-7154",,,,,78,225,246,1,61,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

At the beginning of China's economic reforms in 1978, the annual wage of a Chinese urban worker was only $1,004 in U.S. dollars. The Chinese wage was only 3 percent of the average U.S. wage at that time, and it was also significantly lower than the wages in neighboring Asian countries such as the Philippines and Thailand. The Chinese wage was also low relative to productivity. However, wages are now rising in China. In 2010, the annual wage of a Chinese urban worker reached $5,487 in U.S. dollars, which is similar to wages earned by workers in the Philippines and Thailand and significantly higher than those earned by workers in India and Indonesia. China's wages also increased faster than productivity since the late 1990s, suggesting that Chinese labor is becoming more expensive in this sense as well. The increase in China's wages is not confined to any sector, as wages have increased for both skilled and unskilled workers, for both coastal and inland areas, and for both exporting and nonexporting firms. We benchmark wage growth to productivity growth using both national- and industry-level data, showing that Chinese labor was kept cheap until the late 1990s but the relative cost of labor has increased since then. Finally, we discuss the main forces that are pushing wages up.","[Xiong, Yanyan] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongbin; Li, Lei; Wu, Binzhen] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongbin; Li, Lei; Wu, Binzhen; Xiong, Yanyan] Tsinghua Univ, China Data Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Xiong, YY (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",lihongbin@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; lil6.11@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; wubzh@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; xiongyanyan@seu.edu.cn,"李, 磊/HGD-1908-2022; Wu, Binzhen/JQI-5598-2023; Xiong, Yanyan/ABB-4253-2020","李, 磊/0000-0002-9729-2278; Xiong, Yanyan/0000-0003-3232-8951",,,,,31,175,195,5,75,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We use Cornish-Fisher method to calculate CVaR and adopt quasi-Newton algorithm to solve the optimization problem.

The decline is disproportionately concentrated among the less educated and younger groups within the male and the female populations and, for women, especially among unmarried women without children. About half of the decline among men can be explained by declines in wage rates and by changes in nonlabor income and family structure, but the decline among women is more difficult to explain and requires distinguishing between married and unmarried women and between those with and without children, as these subgroups have experienced quite different wage and employment trends. Neither changes in taxes nor changes in government transfers appear likely to explain the employment declines, with the possible exception of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Other influences such as the minimum wage and health factors do not appear to play a role, but increases in incarceration may have contributed to the decline among men.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Moffitt, RA (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,,,,,57,19,29,1,27,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This note clarifies that rejection of the panel unit root hypothesis should be interpreted as evidence that a statistically significant proportion of the units are stationary. Accordingly, in the event of a rejection, and in applications where the time dimension of the panel is relatively large, it recommends the test outcome to be augmented with an estimate of the proportion of the cross-section units for which the individual unit root tests are rejected. The economic importance of the rejection can be measured by the magnitude of this proportion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Pesaran, M.

A panel firm-level survey was conducted by visiting approximately 500 mostly small and micro enterprises in Bantul District on two occasions: 6 and 12 months after the earthquake. This paper argues that: (i) smaller enterprises are more resilient and so are able to recover faster; (ii) an industrial cluster system within a sub-district provides the necessary support for firms to recover; (iii) the quality of village infrastructure could be important; (iv) it is important to distribute aid as early as possible (the faster it is distributed, the better the impact on enterprises affected by the earthquake); and (v) donors should not give too much assurance of financial support to enterprises in cases where the delivery date is uncertain, but rather just provide support when it is actually available.","[Resosudarmo, Budy P.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Indonesia Project, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Sugiyanto, Catur] Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Kuncoro, Ari] Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ, Depok, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",Australian National University; Gadjah Mada University; University of Indonesia,"Resosudarmo, BP (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Indonesia Project, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",budy.resosudarmo@anu.edu.au; catursugiyanto@yahoo.com; arik@cbn.net.id,"Sugiyanto, Catur/GOP-2380-2022; Resosudarmo, Budy/K-1129-2017","Sugiyanto, Catur/0000-0001-6170-7569; Resosudarmo, Budy/0000-0003-2273-9765",,,,,26,16,19,1,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The development of the both the bond market and the banking sector can increase aggregate productivity through intra-industry reallocation of production toward more productive firms. This positive productivity effect is expected when the most productive firms have easier access to the bond market. However, the result is surprising in the second case because reducing the frictions involved in bank lending allows the entry by firms at the lower end of the efficiency spectrum at the expense of the largest firms. The key is that the largest firms absorb market share from their competitors who switch to bank-based financing, which has higher variable but lower fixed costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Assuming that each country aims to maximize its own welfare, we argue that cooperation needs to be necessary, feasible, and to produce a clearly superior outcome than unilateral action. Not every situation requires policy coordination. There are cases where unilateral and conventional policy measures achieve the necessary readjustment in a welfare-optimizing way. When rebalancing does not automatically happen and the resulting situation is a source of macroeconomic instability, and of welfare losses in the aggregate, internationally coordinated policy action could lead to solutions that generate a better outcome in terms of relative welfare. These solutions, however, are not necessarily stable and players should pre-commit to binding arrangements with sanctions for defection to ensure stability. We conclude that these pre-arrangements can only work if countries trust each other or they trust a supranational body that monitors the implementation of the arrangements and sanctions defection.","[Subacchi, Paola] Chatham House, London, England; [van den Noord, Paul] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Subacchi, P (通讯作者)，Chatham House, London, England.",psubacchi@chathamhouse.org; paul.vandennoord@oecd.org,,"van den Noord, Paul/0000-0001-5725-5811",,,,,19,6,6,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In 2008, China's national savings rate soared to over 53 percent of its GDP, whereas its current account surplus exceeded 9 percent of GDP. This paper presents a unified framework for understanding the structural causes of these imbalances. I argue that the imbalances are attributable to a set of policies and institutions embedded in the economy. I propose a unified framework for understanding the joint causes of the high savings rate and external imbalances in China. My explanations first focus on an array of factors that encouraged saving across the corporate, government, and household sectors, such as policies that affected sectoral income distribution, along with factors like incomplete social welfare reforms, and population control policies. I then turn to policies that limited investment in China, thus preventing the high savings from being used domestically. Finally, I will examine how trade policies, such as export tax rebates, special economic zones, and exchange rate policies, strongly promote exports. Moreover, the accession of China to the World Trade Organization has dramatically amplified the effects of these structural distortions. In conclusion, I recommend some policy reforms for rebalancing the Chinese economy.","Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Yang, DT (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",YangD@darden.virginia.edu,,,,,,,42,53,61,1,36,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In contrast to approaches using global measures like the US corporate bond spreads or short-term interest rates to approximate time variation, our model is also flexible enough to deal with the unfolding of the financial crisis. The findings suggest that the expected debt-to-GDP ratio explains a major part of the differences in bond yields in the euro area between 2003 and the unfolding of the financial crises.

By accounting for productivity differences across industries, the model features income inequality along multiple lines, including inequality between firm owners and workers as well as within these two groups of agents, and involuntary unemployment. We use this setting to study the impact of trade liberalization on key macroeconomic performance measures. In particular, we show that a movement from autarky to free trade with a fully symmetric partner country lowers union wage claims and therefore stimulates employment and raises welfare. Whether firms can extract a larger share of rents in the open economy depends on the competitive environment in the product market. Furthermore, the distribution of profit income across firm owners remains unaffected, while the distribution of wage income becomes more equal when a country opens up to trade with a fully symmetric trading partner. We also analyze how country size differences and technological dissimilarity of trading partners affect the results from our analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The strength of each source in changing the path of the real exchange rate is influenced by nominal rigidities and monetary policy reaction functions. Most interestingly, we show how a successfully implemented inflation-targeting monetary policy in conjunction with an endogenous currency risk premium can be the potential culprit that results in nonstationary real exchange rates.","[Eng, Yoke-Kee; Wong, Chin-Yoong] Jalan Univ, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Business & Finance, Dept Econ, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Habibullah, Muzafar Shah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Upm Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR); Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Eng, YK (通讯作者)，Jalan Univ, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Business & Finance, Dept Econ, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia.",engyk@utar.edu.my,,,,,,,36,4,4,0,7,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Treating the whole economy as one sector this is a standard exercise based on Mundell's original insight that monetary unification can be welfare improving if (among other things) two or more countries contemplating unification face similar economic disturbances. However, treating the economy of each country as a single sector precludes gaining further insights from the empirical exercise. For this purpose, we propose a novel methodology which treats the economy of each country as a collection of three distinct sectors. This allows us to go beyond the standard results usually presented in the form of international correlation of supply and demand shocks. The methodology combines two pieces of information about each sector in a given economy. The first is the international correlation of sector-specific supply and demand shocks. This information is valuable in itself from the economic policy perspective, as it identifies the most and least internationally synchronized sectors, that is, the sectors that are most and least likely to benefit from monetary unification. The second piece of information is the sector-specific weights used for aggregation across sectors in a given country. While interesting in itself, when combined with the first this piece of information points to sectors that are more and less responsible for the final result one obtains from the empirical exercise. The international correlation of supply and demand shocks is a result common to the standard methodology and our methodology, so the latter can also be seen as a robustness check of the former.","[Zapal, Jan] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Krcilkova, Michaela] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Zapal, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Charles University Prague,"Zápal, J (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.zapal@lse.ac.uk,"Zapal, Jan/D-3390-2013","Zapal, Jan/0000-0002-5167-3788",,,,,19,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2012,39.0,3,,,,,407,434,,10.1007/s10663-011-9174-3,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994200007,0

In this paper we develop a theoretical model to show how elections in polarized societies contribute to improve quality of government. We consider both polarization among citizens and political actors (political polarization), where the second is endogenously determined by parties competing to win the support of the majority of voters. We find that more heterogeneous societies are more likely to be politically polarized, but that the divergence of positions in the political arena helps the electorate control government corruption by raising electoral stakes. Our results, which are consistent with the findings of a substantial empirical literature, suggest that, when funneled into political competition, polarization may help improving quality of government and policies.

In this framework, we assess the effectiveness of structural funds, modeled on the EU policy. In a numerical example calibrated to Portugal, we find that, to diminish the initial gap in income per capita, the backward region needs to receive over 8% of its own GDP in structural funds, while the actual disbursements were around 4%. We also find that maximizing innovation in the backward region conflicts in the short run with the goal of maximizing its income per capita.

The counterfactual analysis suggests that had the Federal Reserve raised the interest rate in 2003Q1. it would have curbed the housing market boom before the crisis, yet failed to alleviate the precipitous decline in housing market activity after the crisis. Moreover, the pre-emptive monetary policy aimed to contain the housing market boom can effectively lower volatilities of major economic aggregates; however, it also exerts a significantly negative effect on the levels of these economic aggregates. Thus, using monetary policy to stabilize asset price inflation involves a trade-off between the volatility and the level of economic activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Coinciding with this growth has been a surge in direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), made feasible by the Food and Drug Administrations's (FDA's) clarification of rules governing broadcast advertising in 1997 and 1999. We exploit this natural experiment to investigate the separate effects of broadcast and non-broadcast DTCA on price and demand utilizing an extended monthly time series for all advertised and non-advertised drugs in four therapeutic classes spanning 1994 through 2005, a period that enveloped the shifts in FDA guidelines and the consequent DTCA expansion. Controlling for physician-directed promotion, fixed-effects models indicate broadcast DTCA positively impacts own-sales and price (elasticities of 0.10 and 0.05), while non-broadcast DTCA has a relatively smaller impact. Expansions in broadcast DTCA account for 19% of the overall growth in drug expenditures, two-thirds of this impact being driven by higher demand and the remainder due to higher prices.","[Dave, Dhaval] Bentley Univ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Dave, Dhaval] Natl Bur Econ Res, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Saffer, Henry] Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10016 USA",Bentley University; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Dave, D (通讯作者)，Bentley Univ, 175 Forest St,AAC 195, Waltham, MA 02452 USA.",ddave@bentley.edu; hsaffer@gc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,37,24,34,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The traditional analysis of log-linear learning focuses on explicitly computing the stationary distribution and hence requires a highly structured environment. Since the appeal of log-linear learning is not solely the explicit form of the stationary distribution, we seek to address to what degree one can relax the structural assumptions while maintaining that only potential function maximizers are stochastically stable. In this paper, we introduce slight variants of log-linear learning that provide the desired asymptotic guarantees while relaxing the structural assumptions to include synchronous updates, time-varying action sets, and limitations in information available to the players. The motivation for these relaxations stems from the applicability of log-linear learning to the control of multi-agent systems where these structural assumptions are unrealistic from an implementation perspective.

In the coming years, it will be essential to increase food productivity and production in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and with smallholders.

It discusses in turn the role played by agriculture in the development process and the interactions between agriculture and other economic sectors, the determinants of the Green Revolution and the foundations of agricultural growth, issues of income diversification by farmers, approaches to rural development, and issues of international trade policy and food security, which have been at the root of the crisis in agricultural commodity volatility in recent years.

In particular, the time of the same-sex parent is more productive than that of the opposite-sex parent. When parents have equal wages, efficiency considerations dictate that a parent spends more time with a same-sex child than with an opposite-sex child, but parents allocate the same total time to boys and girls, and costs of raising a boy are the same as raising a girl. When wage rates differ, and the mother is the lower-waged parent, it is cheaper to produce child quality of girls than of boys. We show that many of the empirical results in terms of a different time allocation pattern, total amount of time invested in a child, expenditures on child consumption goods, and family size and composition can be explained by this technological difference and the gender wage gap, without relying on parental preferences for girls versus boys.

With the economic cycle turning again, consolidation of deficits and a reduction of the level of debt are again the focus of policymakers. These outcomes are generally achieved by either increasing tax rates or cutting spending (discretionary fiscal policy), whereas an alternative option is to allow automatic stabilisers to consolidate budgets. This study attempts to answer whether cyclical factors or discretionary policy minimise output volatility and which one of the two presents a better policy option regarding uncertainty in real economic recovery. For this purpose, a small open-economy gap model is built using South African data, where the budget deficit is endogenised by way of a fiscal policy rule. Sensitivity analyses and robustness checks are carried out using a structural vector autoregression. Given the estimates of both the automatic stabilisers as well as the components of discretionary fiscal policy, we are able to obtain impact multipliers on output and conduct scenario testing for optimal fiscal policy response towards fiscal consolidation as well as debt sustainability.","[Jooste, Charl] Natl Treasury, Econ Policy, ZA-0002 Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa; [Marinkov, Marina] Fiscal & Financial Commiss, Midrand, Gauteng, South Africa",,"Jooste, C (通讯作者)，Natl Treasury, Econ Policy, 240 Vermeulen St, ZA-0002 Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa.",charl.jooste@treasury.gov.za; marina@ffc.co.za,,,,,,,33,2,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In our setting a principal wishes to incentivize a team of strategic agents to exert costly effort on his behalf. Agents' actions are hidden and the principal observes only the outcome of the team, which depends stochastically on the complex combinations of the efforts by the agents. The principal seeks the mechanism that maximizes the principal's net revenue given an equilibrium behavior of the agents. We investigate the structure of the optimal mechanism for various production technologies as the principal's value from the project varies. In doing so we quantify the gap between the first-best and second-best solutions. Our results highlight the qualitative and quantitative differences between production technologies that exhibit complementarities and substitutabilities between the agents' actions. In comparing the first best with the second best we highlight the role of effort monitoring by the principal. As we shall see, the benefit from monitoring crucially depends on the underlying technology, with the two polar cases being perfect substitution and perfect complementarity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The traditional utility maximization approach is not only oversimplified but also may not be suitable for real world application. Behavioral asset allocation divides a portfolio into subportfolios, which can cause potential problems. This paper follows the Modern Portfolio Theory and introduces the practical idea of treating some goals as constraints. How this works in practice is illustrated by an example of an individual having three different objectives. This article follows the idea of Chen et al. (2006) and includes life insurance. Consumption is modeled into three parts and accommodates a reasonable basis for calculating life insurance requirements and generally integrates consumption into the investment decision.

Although the average value of capital income is still relatively low, the dispersion of capital income is significant, and for high-income earners capital income is substantial. Compared to other forms of income, capital income is distributed the most unequally, and its contribution to total income inequality has been growing.

Using multivariate spectral analysis techniques, we show that, at odds with a high degree of risk sharing, in most OECD countries the dynamic correlation tends to be quite negative, and significantly so, at frequencies lower than two years the appropriate frequencies for assessing the performance of international business cycle models. Theoretically, we show that the dynamic correlation over different frequencies predicted by standard open economy models is the sum of two terms: a term constant across frequencies, which can be negative when uninsurable risk is large; a term variable across frequencies, which in bond economies is necessarily positive, reflecting the insurance intertemporal trade provides against forecastable contingencies. Numerical analysis suggests that leading mechanisms proposed by the literature to account for the puzzle are consistent with the evidence across the spectrum.","[Corsetti, Giancarlo] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Dedola, Luca] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Corsetti, Giancarlo] Rome III, Rome, Italy",University of Cambridge; European Central Bank,"Corsetti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",giancarlo.corsetti@gmail.com,,"Corsetti, Giancarlo/0000-0001-8965-9853",,,,,31,8,10,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The timing of moves, determined in a preplay stage prior to the contest subgame, as well as the value of the prize is allowed to be endogenous.

(2) The SPE does not need to be unique, in particular, there is no unique SPE with sequential moves if the direct costs of effort are zero. (3) Symmetry among players does not rule out incentives for precommitment to effort locally away from the Cournot-Nash level.

COOPER; ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; POWER-PLANTS; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY; FRAMEWORK; RETURNS; SCALE,"This study proposes a use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment. All radial and non-radial models are discussed under natural and managerial disposability. The natural disposability implies corporate strategy by which a firm attempts to decrease an input vector to decrease a vector of undesirable outputs. Given the decreased input vector, a firm attempts to increase a vector of desirable outputs as much as possible. This type of strategy, supported by economists, indicates negative adaptation to a regulation change on undesirable outputs. In contrast, the managerial disposability indicates opposite strategy by increasing the input vector. This disposability expresses corporate strategy by which a firm considers the regulation change as a new business opportunity. A firm attempts to improve its performance by utilizing new environmental technology and/or new management. This type of strategy, supported by corporate strategists in U.S. business schools, indicates positive adaptation to the regulation change on undesirable outputs. Using the proposed DEA assessment, this study examines the relationship among energy consumption, economic development and environmental protection in Japanese prefectures. To theoretically extend the use of DEA for environmental assessment, this study incorporates Strong Complementary Slackness Conditions (SCSCs) into the proposed radial models. The incorporation of SCSCs has three methodological strengths. First, DEA/SCSCs can handle an occurrence of multiple reference sets and multiple projections. Second, the incorporation of SCSCs makes it possible to restrict dual variables (multiples) in a specific range without any prior information. Finally. DEA/SCSCs can bypass the conventional procedure (i.e., a radial model combined with an additive model) used for DEA radial measurement. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence has shown dramatic differences in the extent of price rigidity across goods: while the prices of some goods change frequently, the prices of other goods seldom change.

We find that, to minimize deadweight loss, lower (higher) tax rates should be imposed on goods with rigid prices if their relative prices are too high (low) relative to the would-be situation of no price stickiness.

This paper presents various data on four Central and East European (CEE) countries, as well as some data on Austria and Germany for the sake of comparison. First, it compares the changes in both distributions over time since the communist period as reported in various sources to see how much disparities and inequality increased during the transition. Second, it presents the attempts that have been made so far to analyze the connections between the two distributions and examines how the relationship between personal and household earnings should be analyzed and what we know about its development. Third, it presents the changing links between earned and disposable income in CEE countries, using Luxembourg Income Study data as a historical baseline and the Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) data for the present time to determine how strong the association was and currently is, and how the countries differ in packaging family income. Various sources confirm that earnings disparities and income inequality rose at least to some degree in all four CEE countries after 1989. This is apparent in the individual countries in various phases of their transitions. In contrast, no increase occurred from 2004 to 2007, according to the EU-SILC surveys.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Sociol, Dept Econ Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Vecerník, J (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Sociol, Dept Econ Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Večerník, Jiří/B-7929-2014; Večerník, Jiří/HNP-8514-2023","Večerník, Jiří/0000-0002-0535-3118; Večerník, Jiří/0000-0002-0535-3118",,,,,30,8,8,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Most existing results are based on regressions that pool many painters. Although the uniqueness of artists' career paths makes it interesting to estimate such regressions for individual artists, sample sizes are often inadequate for a model that would also include the large number of other relevant variables. We address this problem of inadequate degrees of freedom in individual artist regressions by using two statistical methods (model averaging and dimension reduction) to incorporate information from a potentially large number of predictor variables, despite relatively small samples. We find that individual age-valuation profiles can differ substantially from general pooled profiles, suggesting that methods that are more responsive to the unique features of individual artists may provide better predictions of art valuations at auction, and may be useful more generally in hedonic valuation problems.

It is difficult to identify the source of the conflicting results in past studies because of differences in the measure of inflation, the estimation equation, and the instrumental variables. This article presents evidence that a source of the conflict is the use of suboptimal sets of Instruments. When the optimum set of instruments is selected by using the L-2-boosting method from the principal components of a large number of valid instruments, all conflicting conclusions in previous studies vanish. Regardless of the choice of inflation measure and estimation equation, we identify the dominant role of forward-looking behavior and a significant effect of the real marginal cost on inflation.","[Kim, Woong] Bank Korea, Res Dept, Seoul 100794, South Korea; [Hwang, Hae-shin] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Bank of Korea; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Kim, W (通讯作者)，Bank Korea, Res Dept, 110,3 Ga, Seoul 100794, South Korea.",hshwang@tamu.edu; kw@bok.or.kr,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,4,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In doing so, we incorporate the informal sector in a modified New Keynesian model with labor market frictions as in the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model. Our main results show that the informal economy generates a buffer effect that diminishes the pressure of demand shocks on inflation. Finding that is consistent with the empirical literature on the effects of informal labor markets in business cycle fluctuations. This result implies that in economies with large informal labor markets the interest rate channel of monetary policy is relatively weaker.

In contrast to prior research emphasizing group size, I show that even small buyer groups composed of buyers with heterogeneous preferences can increase price competition among rival sellers by committing to purchase exclusively from one seller. Without transfer payments, at least one buyer group exists for each pair of sellers and buyer groups membership is chosen to achieve indifference between the two sellers. With transfer payments, and just two sellers, the grand coalition is a coalition-proof subgame perfect equilibrium (CP-SPNE), though equilibria with arbitrarily many buyer groups also exist.

This paper explores whether the expenditure-switching role of exchange rates has changed in the current episode of significant global imbalances. We develop a multi-sector two-country model for the United States and the G6 countries, with the rest of the world captured by exogenous price and demand shocks, and estimate the model over two sub-samples, which cover the periods before and after the early 1990s. Our results indicate that both U.S. imports and exports have become much less responsive to exchange rate movements in recent years, mainly due to changes in firms' pricing behavior and global trade pattern. These findings suggest that the exchange rate would have to move by a much larger amount now than in the 1970s and 1980s to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by a given amount.

Second, while there is no difference between the most and the least accurate observer in their initial beliefs, there are striking differences in their belief updating rules. The most accurate observers have a well-formulated model of player behavior, are good at best responding and quickly incorporate new information to their beliefs. The worst observers behave in an opposite manner on all three fronts. Third, when the game does not converge, subjects look beyond historical actions to make predictions and place more emphasis on forgone payoffs.

When supply from private stores competes with supply from owild populations' (in nature) and when speculators are able to collude, it may be optimal to coordinate on an extinction strategy. We analyse the behaviour of a speculator who has access to a large initial store, and finds that it is optimal to deter poachers' entry either by depressing prices (carefully timing own supply) or by depressing wild stocks. Which strategy maximizes profits critically depends on the initial wildlife stock and initial speculative stores. We apply the model to the case of black rhino conservation, and conclude it is likely that obanking on extinction' is profitable if current speculators are able to collude. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we also find that extinction is favoured by such factors as low discount rates or high growth rates.","[Mason, Charles F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Bulte, Erwin H.] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bulte, Erwin H.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Horan, Richard D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Wyoming; Wageningen University & Research; Tilburg University; Michigan State University,"Mason, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",bambuzlr@uwyo.edu; erwin.bulte@wur.nl; horan@msu.edu,"Mason, Charles/H-9162-2019","Mason, Charles/0000-0002-9846-0173; Bulte, Erwin/0000-0001-9491-5268",,,,,22,44,47,0,83,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Physical boundaries limit the extent of impacts while the scale of decision making creates perceived boundaries beyond which impacts are ignored by decision makers. While it is well understood that uncertainty and irreversibility will alter policy decisions aimed at alleviating environmental impacts, the effect of spatial scales, both physical and perceived, is less understood. When spatial scale is included in a real options model of environmental policy adoption results indicate that the importance and influence of spatial considerations depends on the level of uncertainty, stringency of the proposed policy and flexibility of the policy decision. Recognizing spatial scale may force policy adoption to take place within a window of current damage. When spatial scale is small or uncertainty high, this window for policy adoption can close precluding policy adoption entirely. This undermines well-known results demonstrating that changes in uncertainty will only alter the timing of policy adoption. In other instances, the policy adoption window remains open but the option value increases faster than the benefits of the policy creating a scenario where it is always preferable to delay. Here the inclusion of an option value can prevent adoption of policies that would be adopted according to traditional cost-benefit analysis. In general policy decisions will be most affected by spatial considerations when the spatial scale is small, damage is spreading fast, and the uncertainty in damage spread is high.

Using a database covering 56 advanced and emerging economies for the period 1970-2008, it finds that fiscal policy appears to matter for the impact of banking crises on headline growth but not on potential output. The stronger impact of fiscal policy during banking crises, however, does not seem to be driven by the fact that resources are largely underutilized in those periods.

Given the modest economic impacts of immigration estimated in most studies, the depth of anti-immigrant sentiment is puzzling. Immigration, however, does not just affect wages and taxes. It also changes the composition of the local population, threatening the compositional amenities that natives derive from their neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. In this paper we use a simple latent-factor model, combined with data for 21 countries from the 2002 European Social Survey (ESS), to measure the relative importance of economic and compositional concerns in driving opinions about immigration policy. The ESS included a unique battery of questions on the labor market and social impacts of immigration, as well as on the desirability of increasing or reducing immigrant inflows. We find that compositional concerns are 25 times more important in explaining variation in individual attitudes toward immigration policy than concerns over wages and taxes. Likewise, most of the difference in opinion between more- and less-educated respondents is attributable to heightened compositional concerns among people with lower education.","[Card, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dustmann, Christian; Preston, Ian] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of London; University College London,"Card, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",card@econ.berkeley.edu; c.dustmann@ucl.ac.uk; i.preston@ucl.ac.uk,"Card, David/M-5090-2019",,,,,,40,192,220,2,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

This article discusses those premises, focusing on the claim that the promise of ever-rising implied carbon prices under such market-based mechanisms will support induced innovation in low- or no-carbon technologies. It notes that this claim assumes that promise to be credible and sufficient to induce the innovations required. It argues that the assumed credibility of such very long commitments is questionable, and hence, even in the best of worlds, the implied benefits are unlikely to arise. For a small country like Australia, the problems are then compounded by the absence of a credible, global agreement on emission reduction. Given that, the marginal benefits of investing in carbon abatement are likely to be very low or negative.","[Ergas, Henry] Deloitte Access Econ, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Ergas, Henry] Univ Wollongong, SMART Infrastruct Facil, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; University of Wollongong,"Ergas, H (通讯作者)，Deloitte Access Econ, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",ergas.henry@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,7,7,1,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-9018,,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

Individuals who started working on or after 1993 face permanently a much higher earnings cap for payroll taxes, creating a large and permanent discontinuity in marginal payroll tax rates by date of entry in the labor force for upper earnings workers. Using full-population administrative social security data and a regression discontinuity design, we estimate the long-term labor supply effects and incidence of payroll tax rates on earnings. Standard theory predicts that in the long run, new regime workers should bear the entire burden of the payroll tax increase (relative to old regime workers). In contrast, we find that employers compensate new regime workers for the extra employer payroll taxes but not for the extra employee payroll taxes. We do not find any evidence of labor supply responses along the extensive or intensive margins around the discontinuity, suggesting low efficiency costs of payroll taxes. We discuss various possible explanations for those results.","[Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Saez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Tsakloglou, Panos/AAF-2099-2020","MATSAGANIS, EMMANUEL/0000-0002-0369-6280",,,,,34,46,58,3,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

In contrast to previous research, we find that inflation persistence has fallen significantly since the start of EMU. Persistence of consumer price inflation, which is central to the European Central Bank's policy mandate, has fallen more than the persistence of deflator inflation. The drop in inflation persistence is consistent with the results from a simulated small New Keynesian model with a shift toward a more aggressive monetary policy stance.","Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Tillmann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, Licher Str 66, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",peter.tillmann@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

This article is the first to investigate the longer term effects, within adolescence and from adolescence into early adulthood, of peers on individual weight outcomes. Using data from the first three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), and accounting for correlated effects using a number of empirical strategies including school-level fixed effects and accounting for neighbourhood preferences, we show that Body Mass Index (BMI) and overweight status in a person's friendship network influence their BMI and likelihood of being overweight. The evidence suggests that there is some persistence of the effects of past peer weight experiences on individual weight outcomes during adolescence and into early adulthood. The findings are consistent with adolescence being an important formative period of individuals' preference for ideal physique and own body weight aspirations. We conclude that policy makers should be particularly concerned with interventions during childhood and adolescence, in order to slow the spread of obesity by promoting a healthy body image and positive health behaviours.","[Ali, Mir M.; Amialchuk, Aliaksandr] Univ Toledo, Dept Econ, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Ali, Mir M.] US FDA, Off Regulat Policy & Social Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Gao, Song] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100011, Peoples R China; [Heiland, Frank] CUNY, CUNY Inst Demog Res, Sch Publ Affairs, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); Central University of Finance & Economics; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Ali, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Toledo, Dept Econ, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",mir.ali@fda.hhs.gov,,,,,,,44,23,25,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using panel data on older workers, we find that workers report skill obsolescence more often when learning is a structural characteristic of the job. This perceived skill obsolescence is not related to a higher probability of losing employment. Instead, workers who experience skill obsolescence appear to learn more on the job and participate more often in training, which decreases the risk of losing employment. These results are consistent with the dynamic model of skill obsolescence and employment loss we develop in this article. Moreover, we find that when workers with long job tenures decrease their training participation, this is an early indicator of future job loss.","[Allen, Jim; de Grip, Andries] Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ & Labour Market ROA, Maastricht, Netherlands; [de Grip, Andries] Inst Zukunft Arbeit, Bonn, Germany; [de Grip, Andries] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Tilburg University,"de Grip, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ & Labour Market ROA, Maastricht, Netherlands.",a.degrip@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"De Grip, Andries/A-6021-2009",,,,,,17,27,31,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A firm, formed by a shareholder and a manager, can sign either an incentive contract or a contract including a Code of Best Practice. A Code allows for better management control, but makes it hard for managers to react quickly when market conditions change. Codes tend to be adopted in markets with low volatility and in environments where managers obtain low levels of benefits. The firms with the best projects tend to adopt a Code when managers are not too heterogeneous, while the best managers tend to be hired through incentive contracts when the projects are similar. Although the matching between shareholders and managers is often positively assortative, shareholders with the best projects might be willing to renounce hiring the best managers; instead, signing contracts including Codes with lower-ability managers.","[Perez-Castrillo, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Castrillo, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CODE, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Alonso-Pauli, Eduard] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Pérez-Castrillo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Carretera Utrera Km 1, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",ealonso@upo.es; david.perez@uab.es,"Perez-Castrillo, David/D-7585-2012; Alonso-Pauli, Eduard/K-8395-2017","Perez-Castrillo, David/0000-0002-1840-7621; Alonso-Pauli, Eduard/0000-0001-7149-3760",,,,,40,16,17,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

A dimension that is usually neglected is improving individuals' conversion efficiency, i.e. the efficiency with which individual resources are converted into well-being. To examine effects of policies on (the development of) this measure we suggest an intertemporal index of conversion efficiency estimated via a nonparametric order-m approach. The approach is exemplified using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) from 1991 to 2006. We find that over this time horizon between 24% and 29% of individuals were efficient in their conversion of resources into well-being. Moreover, age and self-employment increase an individual's conversion efficiency, while living in London, being disabled and being separated, divorced or widowed all decrease conversion efficiency. Being married also decreases the conversion efficiency and we find few evidence of gender disparities in conversion efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Our results contradict the widespread view that foreign banks have been driving FX lending to retail clients as a result of easier access to foreign wholesale funding. Our cross-sectional analysis shows that foreign banks do lend more in FX to corporate clients but not to households. Moreover, we find no evidence that wholesale funding had a strong causal effect on FX lending for either foreign or domestic banks. Panel estimations show that the foreign acquisition of a domestic bank does lead to faster growth in FX lending to households. However, this is driven by faster growth in household lending in general not by a shift towards FX lending.","[Brown, Martin] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Brown, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.",,,"De Haas, Ralph/0000-0002-1945-1931",,,,,41,68,69,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The article, drawing on international experiences, puts forward several policy suggestions relating to improvement in total factor productivity, expansion of human capital accumulation and deepening of system and government function reforms.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Cai, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",caifang@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,21,61,66,3,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2012,20.0,1,,,SI,,49,61,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01272.x,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,899RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300835100003,0

We use the Threshold Autoregressive-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (TAR-GARCH) model to obtain a better approximation of the volatility pattern with the threshold of a positive or negative prior return autocorrelation. In contrast to the general regime-switching model that focuses on the mean equation or on the variance equation with prior shocks as the threshold variable, we consider the asymmetric response of volatility to the autocorrelation of stock returns and apply a nonlinear relationship between autocorrelation and volatility to refine the volatility equation. The empirical results indicate that different levels of autocorrelation are related to stock return volatility. Regardless of whether there is positive or negative correlation, the volatility increases under larger absolute values of autocorrelation both during and after the Asian financial crisis. Stock returns are observed in 10 countries before, during and after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.","[Chang, Chiao-Yi] Natl Taichung Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Insurance & Finance, Taichung 404, Taiwan; [Shie, Fu-Shuen] Natl Taichung Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Taichung 404, Taiwan",,"Chang, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Insurance & Finance, 129,Sec 3,Sanmin Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",cyc@ntit.edu.tw,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The lack of insurance coverage for routine care costs associated with participating in clinical trials is often cited as a major barrier to clinical trial participation, especially for low income individuals and racial minorities who are highly cost-sensitive. This article examines if state mandates requiring health insurers to cover routine care costs for patients enroled in clinical trials helped reduce the gap in clinical trial access between the affluent and the poor and between whites and racial minorities. Using data on the locations of cancer clinical trials initiated in the US between 2001 and 2007 as well as Census data on income and race, we examine the effects of the policies on clinical trial sponsors' location choices. Our analysis indicates that the policies helped increase availability of phase 2 clinical trials in areas with a high proportion of black residents, thereby partially mitigating race-based disparity in clinical trial access. We do not find any evidence that the policies helped alleviate income-based disparity in clinical trial access.","[Park, Minjung] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chun, Natalie] Asian Dev Bank, Dept Econ & Res, Manila, Philippines",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Asian Development Bank,"Park, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mpark@haas.berkeley.edu,"Park, Minjung/R-7774-2017","Park, Minjung/0000-0002-5693-9370",,,,,12,0,2,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We develop a framework in which merger efficiency gains are endogenously determined and are not observed by the Competition Authority. The possibility of an efficiency defense can push firms to design the merger better, leading to greater efficiency gains. Firms can also submit remedies to the Competition Authority: they interact with the efficiency defense, by reducing the firm's incentive to enhance efficiency. At the same time remedies improve the assessment of the merger, in particular by signaling the true level of efficiency gains. We ask to what extent it may be optimal to make use of both instruments simultaneously, and thus discuss the possibility that the Competition Agency refrain from using one of the instruments to try to improve overall merger-control performance.

Yet, assessed property values are generally more readily available than actual sales values and have, in some studies, been used in lieu of market prices. In this study, we compare estimates of different non-market amenity values based on actual transactions and assessed values. We estimate a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model with two hedonic price equations, one with actual market values as the dependent variable and the other with assessed property values, and compare the resulting estimates of shadow prices for open space amenities. We also take into account spatial autocorrelation and combine Method of Moment estimates of the spatial parameters in both equations to create our test statistic. The results indicate that we cannot accept the hypothesis that the impacts of open space on property values are the same for actual sales and assessed values. Moreover, we do observe some differences between the distributions of assessed versus sales values, although the difference between the sizes of open space effects measured within the two equations is rather limited. Thus, while this one study is insufficient to enable one to draw definitive conclusions, there remains the possibility that policy makers cannot reliably base decisions on amenity values obtained from a hedonic model using assessed values.

Firm fixed effects models show a negative inelastic relationship between member cost sharing and plan bids. Among the utilization controls, only prior authorization is associated with lower bids. The use of quantity limits and step therapy is associated with higher bids, although this reflects their likely use for nonpreferred brand name medications. Bids are positively related to the number of preferred brand name medications and specialty medications covered, gap coverage of generics and brand name medications and the regional risk score.

This article focuses on soya beans for which Brazil became a top exporter. The panel data technique is used to estimate the soy bean supply response at national and regional level. Soya bean supply is shown to be very price elastic. Moreover, soya bean supply own price elasticity is much higher in the Center-North regions than in the South of the country. Substitution between livestock and soya bean is also very significant in the Center-North region. World agricultural trade models should take account for such regional variability of soya bean supply elasticity.

The normatively best allocation can be further characterized as the Nash solution of a bargaining game induced by the second-stage choice problem.","[Dillenberger, David] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sadowski, Philipp] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Duke University,"Dillenberger, D (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ddill@sas.upenn.edu; p.sadowski@duke.edu,,,,,,,37,34,42,1,23,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Based on a longitudinal plant-level data and using dynamic panel techniques we investigated the validity of the hypothesis that the intensity of investment increases as its extent increases. Our results indicate a strong linkage between the extent and intensity of investment decisions, finding which holds both for positive and negative investment decisions. This linkage suggests that the decision on how many capital types to initiate investment is closely connected to the decision regarding the depth of investment expenditures. Moreover, the intensity-extent derivative remains positive but its magnitude decreases with plant size, providing indirect evidence for higher complementarity between capital types for smaller plants.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Drakos, K (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, 76 Patiss St, Athens 10434, Greece.",kdrakos@aueb.gr,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While many studies provide evidence for this empirical fact and explore several hypotheses about its causes, the impact of motherhood on job dimensions other than wages has scarcely been investigated. In order to assess changes in women's jobs around motherhood, I use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and employ a first difference analysis. The results reveal that women when having children accommodate at their original employer primarily through adjustments in working hours. Yet, when changing the employer women adjust their jobs in several dimensions, such as different aspects of the work schedule (working hours, work at night or according to a flexible schedule) as well as the level of stress. Further analysis provides some limited support for the motherhood wage gap being explained by adjustments in the work conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The PCI is then decomposed into three components: (i) a 'deep' component (i. e. traditional variables unrelated to the environmental debate); (ii) a factor endowment component and (iii) a 'pollution haven' component reflecting the impact of differences in environmental policies. The estimation is carried out for 1987 for an extensive data set covering 10 pollutants, 48 countries and 79 ISIC four-digit sectors. Decompositions based on cross-section econometric estimates suggest a significant pollution haven effect, which increases the PCI of the North because of stricter environmental regulations in the North. At the same time, the factor endowment effect lowers the PCI of the North, as the North is relatively well-endowed in capital and pollution-intensive activities are capital intensive. On a global scale, because the bulk of trade is intra-regional with a high North-North share, these effects are small relative to the 'deep' determinants of the worldwide PCI. Robustness checks performed on a more recent dataset, but limited to sulphur dioxide, confirm these results. In sum, differences in factor endowments and environmental policies only marginally affected the PCI of world trade at the end of the 1980s.","[Grether, Jean-Marie; Mathys, Nicole Andrea] Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Mathys, Nicole Andrea] Swiss Fed Off Energy, Bern, Switzerland; [de Melo, Jaime] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [de Melo, Jaime] CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel; University of Geneva,"Grether, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",jean-marie.grether@unine.ch,,"Mathys, Nicole/0000-0002-4981-0333; Grether, Jean-Marie/0000-0002-2601-3585",,,,,35,27,30,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Payaslioglu (2009) considers the case of the Turkish exchange rate using the traditional Hill (1975) estimator as a tool. In this article, we employ also an alternative estimator proposed in Iglesias and Linton (2009) that is shown to have, in some cases, improved finite sample properties and it provides substantially different results versus the Hill estimator. We find that for the Euro, Japanese Yen, Swiss franc, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars, the Hill estimator provides a better measure to analyse the extreme behaviour; while for the British pound, the Iglesias and Linton alternative estimator is superior by using Hausman-type tests of misspecification. Measures of value at risk are also provided for the seven markets. We also find that the largest estimated value at risk by far is for the Japanese Yen, followed by the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the New Zealand dollar and the Australian dollar. The UK pound has the smallest value at risk when extreme movements occur.","Univ A Coruna, Dept Appl Econ 2, Corruna 15071, Spain",Universidade da Coruna,"Iglesias, EM (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Appl Econ 2, Campus Elvina, Corruna 15071, Spain.",emma.iglesias@udc.es,"Iglesias, Emma/C-6631-2015","Iglesias, Emma/0000-0002-7750-8166",,,,,18,5,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

All the member states are obliged to accomplish objectives defined as part of European Employment Strategy, i.e. the so-called full employment, improved quality and productivity of labour as well as greater coherence of social integration. These objectives, among other things, in the form of employment rates established for each Member state, are to provide certain strategy to be followed as part of labour market policy. With the use of various labour market instruments, the strategy is aimed at increasing employment and thus reducing the unemployment rate. The article analyses changes in the use of active and passive instruments adopted on labour markets in Poland and the European Union during the period 2005-2009. A thesis has been formulated, that in Poland and the European Union expenses on active instruments used on the labour market are subject to increase. It is due to the fact that active instruments, unlike the passive ones, are of profound importance to improving the quality of labour supply. The thesis has been confirmed for Poland, yet is not the case with the European Union.","[Jarecki, Wojciech] Tech Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Microecon, Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Jarecki, W (通讯作者)，Ul Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",czoper@wneiz.pl,,"Jarecki, Wojciech/0000-0002-4463-7607",,,,,8,0,0,0,8,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

Using Swedish matched survey and register data, we apply sample selection models to correct for nonrandom sampling into paid employment. There are three main findings of the study. First, diverging from the most prevalent consumption group (long-term light drinkers) is associated with an increased probability of long-term sickness, ranging from 10% for long-term heavy drinkers to 18% for former drinkers. Second, controlling for former consumption errors (especially former drinker and former abstainer errors) and sample selection into employment are important for unbiased, consistent estimations. Third, by predicting the effect of changes in consumption on long-term sickness-related absence, we find that alcohol only explains a small part of the overall picture of long-term sickness-related absenteeism. Notwithstanding this fact, long-term sickness-related absenteeism due to alcohol adds up to substantial productivity loss for society. Our conclusion is that the commonly found U-shaped relationship between current alcohol consumption and labour market outcomes remains for women, after controlling for past consumption and selection effects. A change in consumption level increases probability of long-term sickness-related absence, compared to individuals with constant consumption levels.","[Jarl, J.; Gerdtham, U. -G.] Lund Univ, Inst Econ Res, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Jarl, J.; Gerdtham, U. -G.] Lund Univ Reg Skane, Ctr Primary Hlth Care Res, S-20502 Malmo, Sweden; [Gerdtham, U. -G.] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Jarl, J.; Gerdtham, U. -G.] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci Malmo, Div Hlth Econ, SE-20502 Malmo, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University,"Jarl, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Inst Econ Res, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",johan.jarl@med.lu.se,"Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/I-6766-2018","Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/0000-0002-0647-7817; Jarl, Johan/0000-0002-9274-2479",,,,,51,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Examining within-exporter variation in prices across destinations, prices are increasing in the difficulty of entering the destination market in the majority of sectors. This pattern is consistent with models in which product quality is positively correlated with firm size. However, prices decrease in export thresholds in some large sectors, including autos, apparel, and electronics. I discuss the causes and consequences of this cross-sector heterogeneity. From an accounting perspective, selection into exporting explains a small fraction of overall price variation, but accounts for nearly half of variation in bilateral trade. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The article operationalizes recent conceptual developments in multidimensional distribution theory and assesses their usefulness for the measurement of multidimensional household inequality. The results strongly highlight the importance of bringing nonmonetary aspects of household welfare into the forefront of inequality analysis. Agreement over the various approaches to the measurement of multidimensional inequality entails, however, nontrivial decisions that may limit the practical usefulness of these measures. We suggest that the use of multidimensional inequality ranges and the application of restrictive dominance criteria to multidimensional welfare distributions may open significant scope for further developments in the empirical analysis of multidimensional inequality.","Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Justino, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",p.justino@ids.ac.uk,,"Justino, Patricia/0000-0001-9282-8945",,,,,75,8,9,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The key empirical facts are that, on average within narrowly defined sectors, (1) larger plants charge more for their outputs and (2) larger plants pay more for their material inputs. The latter fact generalizes the well-known positive correlation between plant size and wages. Similar correlations hold between prices and export status. We show that the empirical patterns are consistent with a parsimonious extension of the Melitz (2003, The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity, Econometrica, 71, 1695-1725) framework to include endogenous choice of input and output quality. Using a measure of the scope for quality differentiation from Sutton (1998, Technology and Market Structure: Theory and History.

Application of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test suggests a cointegrating relationship between either output measure and the share of government spending, and further application of General to Specific (GETS), Engle and Granger (EG), Phillip Hansen's Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Johansen's time series techniques illustrate statistical robustness and an income elasticity between 0.56 and 0.84. The results suggest that output measures Granger cause the share of government expenditure in the long run, thereby providing support for Wagner's Law, and these results are stable irrespective of the chosen output measure.","[Kumar, Saten; Webber, Don J.; Fargher, Scott] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Webber, DJ (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand.",don.webber@aut.ac.nz,,,,,,,35,32,33,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We do this using an unbalanced panel consisting primarily of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries that have both patent and R&D expenditure information broken down by domestic and foreign sources. Our analysis shows that even among a fairly homogeneous group of countries, the sources of patents and R&D differ substantially. Using a dynamic panel framework, we find that domestic R&D per capita increases domestic patents per capita only for the European Patent Convention (EPC) countries that already have a decentralized approach to innovation. Foreign R&D per capita increases foreign patents per capita in all countries even though foreign R&D constitutes a very small fraction of total R&D. We find that some of these differences can be attributed to the locations of the patent applications, including those to the European Patent Office (EPO), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and triadic patent applications to the EPO, USPTO and Japan Patent Office (JPO) simultaneously.","[Kumazawa, R.] Duquesne Univ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA; [Gomis-Porqueras, P.] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Duquesne University; Australian National University,"Kumazawa, R (通讯作者)，Duquesne Univ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Sci, 600 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA.",kumazawar@duq.edu,"Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/AAS-6934-2020","Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/0000-0002-3637-9142",,,,,17,3,3,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, it is quite complicated phenomenon. Causes of migration can be understandable deeper after classifying and summarizing the main theories in an appropriate way. The most of scientists agrees that migration's theory, which could explain all aspects and reasons of migration, will never be created because of confusing variety of processes included in it. However, the purpose of this article was not to propose such single theory. Various consistent patterns and correlations can be seen in the migration's movements. After classifying and summarizing these aspects, it is possible to understand the causes of migration deeper. Thus, the authors of this paper tried to analyze, sort out migration theories and to put them together. In the first part of this article, Economic equilibrium, Heckscher-Ohlin, Todaro and Harris-Todaro, Human capital, Early decision-making, Dual labor market, Self-selection, Family migration, Relative deprivation, Motivation decisions, Rational expectation, Consumption, Network, Cumulative causation, Migration systems, Zelinsky, Skeldon, Migration hump and Push and pull theories of migration were analyzed. In the second part, all above mentioned theories according to their features, similarities and period were classified in the Neoclassical, New, International movement solvents and Spatio-temporal transition theories groups. It should be noted that not all above mentioned theories could be directly attributed to one group. Some theories, as Early decision-making theory, could be attributed to both Neoclassical theory (because of personal factors) and New theory (because of family characteristics included in personal factors) of migration. Finally, theories groups were associated with interrelationships and summarized in to one integrated Push and pull model. Push and pull model has been developed by a lot of scientists continuously: Ravenstein, (1889), Lee, (1966), Altbach, (1998), Mazzarol & Soutar, (2002), and many others (Wang, 2010). Many theorists have followed footsteps of migration Push and pull model. These theories have been improved and supplemented with new push or/and pull factors. Thus, it can be said that most migration theories can be combined together. Push and pull model of discussed migration theories could be one of suggestions how to integrate theories into one model. This integrated model of theories could reveal the reasons for migration wider and deeper. Proposed model can be used as integrated and complex model seeking to understand migration theories and the main migration reasons based push and pull motives deeper.","[Kumpikaite, Vilmante; Zickute, Ineta] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Kumpikaite, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilmante.kumpikaite@ktu.lt; ineta.zickute@ktu.lt,"Kumpikaitė-Valiūnienė, Vilmantė/D-3736-2016","Kumpikaite-Valiuniene, Vilmante/0000-0002-8099-2737",,,,,24,17,24,4,78,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, the APEC membership effect is not uniform: the positive effect of APEC membership is mainly due to the overshadowing role of East Asian countries.

Given the changing industry map in East Asia, Korean firms have been seeking a new international division of labor with Chinese firms via foreign direct investment. During the last two decades, Korean firms in China attempted to create business models that implemented either a full set of business activities (full model) or a partial set of business activities (partial model). We have found that the competitiveness of Korean firms in China experienced drastic changes, which changed the viability of specific models, namely the partial model, for Korean business in China. Our cases have indicated that both full and partial models evolved responding to environmental changes in the host market. The central reason for such changes is that as Chinese firms accomplished a technological catch-up, they began to replace the roles of Korean firms in China at a rapid rate, which obsolesced the bargaining power of Korean firms in China in their relations with their Chinese partners. Our study implies that Korean firms going to China, when seeking for a viable business model, should deliberately consider the possibility of Chinese firms' catching-up with Korean firms within the industries.","[Kwak, Jooyoung] Yonsei Univ, Yonsei Sch Business, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Mihnsoo] Univ Incheon, Sch NE Asian Studies, Inchon, South Korea",Yonsei University; Seoul National University (SNU); Incheon National University,"Kwak, J (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Yonsei Sch Business, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",jooyoung.kwak@yonsei.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",,,,,35,3,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We find that the time paths of adoption for both generally exhibit the typical S shape found for other innovations. We identify factors likely responsible for the patterns observed and in the process extend the scope of the diffusion literature by incorporating insights from the optimization behaviour of nonprofits. Using a proportional hazards framework, we find that faster adoption occurred among institutions focused on research and doctoral education as well as among select liberal arts colleges relative to nonselect colleges. Faster adoption also occurred for larger institutions, suggesting that they benefited from economies of scale. Adoption was slower for institutions having a larger percent of female faculty members. Also, there is some evidence to suggest that public institutions were faster to innovate than private institutions, while institutions in the South tended to innovate more slowly than institutions located in other regions of the country.","[Levin, Sharon G.] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Stephan, Paula E.] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Stephan, Paula E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Winkler, Anne E.] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ & Publ Policy Adm, St Louis, MO 63121 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis,"Levin, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",slevin@umsl.edu,,,,,,,44,6,14,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Consumption smoothing is modelled by means of an equilibrium correction mechanism, which disentangles short-run dynamics and long-run equilibrium adjustments. GMM estimation is used to control for individual household effects in the presence of dynamics. Additionally, we differentiate between food and non-food consumption, positive and negative shocks, rural and urban areas, and several levels of poverty risk. We find that dynamics are important in the consumption equation, and that estimates are sensitive to imputation errors in home food production.

Revenue management practices often include overbooking capacity to account for customers who make reservations but later make cancellations or do not show up. Capacity control deals with the question of which requests should be accepted over time. Overbooking and capacity control decisions interact. The joint problem can be formulated as a dynamic program.

Downsizing of the state was one of the major elements in a reform package designed to transform the centrally planned economy into a market one (together with deregulation, privatisation, macroeconomic stabilisation and the opening up of the closed economy). This downsizing, however, proved to be the single most important reason for the collapse of state institutions, which in turn deepened the transformational recession, contributed to the dramatic rise of income inequalities, corruption and crime, and the decline in life expectancy. The story of the successes and failures of transition is not really the story of consistent shock therapy and inconsistent gradualism. The major plot of the postsocialist transformation 'novel' is the preservation of strong institutions in some countries (very different in other respects-from Central Europe and Estonia to China, Uzbekistan and Belarus) and the collapse of these institutions in other countries. At least 90% of this story is about government failure (the strength of state institutions) and not about market failure (liberalisation).",,,"Popov, V (通讯作者)，UN, DESA, DPAD, 2 United Nations Plaza,DC 2-1444, New York, NY 10017 USA.",vpopov@nes.ru,"Popov, Vladimir/B-7314-2013","Popov, Vladimir/0000-0003-0428-3725",,,,,33,8,9,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The results of our study show that Pakistani consumers are more sensitive towards purchasing and owning homemade products as compared to imported products.

We characterize the solution to a class of arbitration problems using the axiomatic approach. The axioms we impose on the arbitration solution are Symmetry in Offers, Invariance and Pareto Optimality. The key axiom,  Symmetry in Offers, requires that whenever players' offers are symmetric, the arbitrated outcome should also be symmetric. We find that there exists a unique arbitration solution, called the symmetric arbitration solution, that satisfies all three axioms. We then analyze a simultaneous-offer game and an alternating-offer game. In both games, the symmetric arbitration solution is used to decide the outcome whenever players cannot reach agreement by themselves. We find that in both games, if the discount factor of players is close to 1, then the unique subgame perfect equilibrium outcome coincides with the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution outcome.","Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Rong, K (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",rong.kang@shufe.edu.cn,,"Rong, Kang/0000-0001-9865-5934",,,,,16,5,5,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

For this purpose, we construct two empirical frameworks, namely growth accounting and production function. Estimation results based on the growth-accounting framework suggest that R&D intensity has a positive and significant effect (15%) on total factor productivity. The results also confirm that the performance of foreign firms operating in the industry is more sensitive toward R&D than the local firms. Furthermore, the estimation results of the production function approach indicate that the output elasticity to R&D capital varies from 10% to 13%. In view of these findings, we propose further encouragement and incentives for doing in-house innovative activities in the Indian pharmaceutical industry.","Natl Inst Financial Management, Faridabad, Haryana, India",,"Sharma, C (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Financial Management, Faridabad, Haryana, India.",chandanieg@gmail.com,"Sharma, Chandan/AAC-4084-2019","Sharma, Chandan/0000-0002-0625-5237",,,,,41,49,54,0,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This is done to reflect the fact that the asset process cannot be observed directly and thus that default times are basically unpredictable. Here we present a variant of the DL model that substitutes an earnings process for the asset value process used in the original version of the model. Using an earnings process as the state variable ties default to a piece of publicly available information widely considered to be a sign of a firm's financial well-being. It also allows for the precise specification of accounting noise, which is only sketched in the original DL model. In the last section, we specify a Bayesian methodology for applying the model in practice.","PIMCO, Newport Beach, CA 92660 USA","Pacific Investment Management Company, LLC","Simonian, J (通讯作者)，PIMCO, 840 Newport Ctr Dr, Newport Beach, CA 92660 USA.",joseph.simonian@pimco.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The methodology we use to answer these questions is a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), estimated with data from a panel of Spanish municipalities during the period 1988 to 2006. Our results confirm that Spanish municipalities do indeed make adjustments in response to fiscal shocks (i.e. the deficit is stationary in the long run). We compare our results with those obtained for US and Germany to evaluate if the viability of local finance depends on the institutional arrangement and to analyse how it affects the adjustment patterns. We observe that grants have a more important role in the adjustment process in environments where either they have an equalization objective or where there is no clear rule that determines their distribution. This fact can generate a moral hazard problem: governments tend to spend more due to the expected intervention by the central government. Own revenues have a lower adjustment capacity in environments where subcentral governments have limited fiscal autonomy. These results, however, suggest that the viability of the local finance system is feasible with different institutional arrangements.","[Sorribas-Navarro, Pilar] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Spain; IEB, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Sorribas-Navarro, P (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Avda Diagonal 690,Torre 4,2 Planta, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",psorribas@ub.edu,"Sorribas-Navarro, Pilar/R-6170-2018","Sorribas-Navarro, Pilar/0000-0002-9877-3508",,,,,36,16,17,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although ambiguity aversion has been consistently observed in a variety of situations, uncertainty due to incomplete knowledge can be resolved by obtaining missing information, and people explore the ambiguous options as well. Here, we review a number of neuroimaging studies on ambiguity aversion and associated works.

The work of the Minimum Wage Study Commission (1981) uncovered the small size of the unemployment inflation effect, and the new minimum wage research also has corroborated this. Seen against these findings, the persistent rhetoric of sizeable unemployment effects of minimum wage increases simply shows the power of employers in a capitalist system. This paper suggests that counteracting the rhetoric is best done by recognizing the agency of the minimum wage worker and portraying this worker not as one who may suffer unemployment under a wage increase but who chooses to work fewer hours if hourly wages and benefits become sufficient.","[Bechtold, Brigitte H.] Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Bechtold, Brigitte H.] Cent Michigan Univ, Ctr Res Poverty, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",Central Michigan University; Central Michigan University,"Bechtold, BH (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, 140 Anspach Hall, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",becht1bh@cmich.edu,,,,,,,16,2,3,1,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The effect of financial constraints intensified in 2009 and alleviated slightly in 2010, although still being significantly more intense than before the crisis hit the economy. By estimating a switching regression model with unknown sample separation that enabled us to address the problem of judgemental sample separation, we were also able to estimate the error-correction model separately for financially constrained and financially unconstrained firms. The results indicate that financial constraints have a significant effect on both financially constrained and financially unconstrained firms, although corporate investments were more severely affected in financially constrained firms.

To explore this hypothesis, we have developed a standard growth model with physical and intangible capital in which technical progress is equipment-specific. We assume that the obsolescence of intangible capital increases when the equipment-specific technical progress accelerates. The model is calibrated for the period 1957-1973 and the response of the economy to an increase in the rate of equipment-specific technical progress - as observed since 1974 - is simulated. We show that this setup can account for a large part of the post-1974 slowdown observed in productivity and in the Solow residual.","[del Rio, Fernando; Sampayo, Antonio] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Sampayo, Antonio] Fac CC Econ & Empresariais, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"del Rio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",fernando.delrio@usc.es; ar.sampayo@usc.es,"del Río, Fernando/AAD-1065-2022; Rodriguez Sampayo, Antonio/L-7672-2014","del Río, Fernando/0000-0001-7448-5045; Rodriguez Sampayo, Antonio/0000-0002-8667-4940",,,,,34,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

Regional governments have employed the overtaking strategy (placing primary emphasis on the development of capital and technology-intensive industries) and the real estate development strategy to push for economic growth and fiscal revenue growth. This led to a primary and secondary income distribution structure biased toward capital and government and against labor and a government expenditure structure biased toward infrastructure and against social welfare. Using the empirical strategy of Acemoglu et al. (2003), we confirm that the overtaking strategy and the real estate development strategy have contributed to the internal imbalances of overinvestment and underconsumption. The biased primary and secondary income distribution structures as well as the biased government expenditure structure serve as important mediating channels through which the development strategies translate into an imbalanced consumption-investment structure. It suggests that the Chinese government will be able to accomplish China's transition from an investment-led growth model to a consumption-investment balanced growth model only if it modifies its development strategies.

This paper documents racial and ethnic differences in male earnings from 1950 through 2010 using data from the decennial census and American Community Surveys. Emphasis is given to annual rather than weekly or hourly earnings. We take a quantile approach, providing evidence on medians and other percentiles of the distribution. Treatment of imputed earnings greatly affects measured outcomes. Hispanic men have exhibited earnings growth similar to white men over several decades.

The paper starts by proposing a framework to understand the relation among overtime work, labor process, and the wage gap and presents the puzzling contradiction between low wages and the need to sustain the reproduction of labor power for Chinese workers. The paper then details the bi-directional determination between the subordination of labor in the workplace and the wage gap, and further analyzes the critical conditions for the stability of the current labor institutions and sustaining capital accumulation.","[Li, Zhongjin; Qi, Hao] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Qi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Thompson Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",hqi@econs.umass.edu,,"Qi, Hao/0000-0002-5830-1274",,,,,20,21,23,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The proposed model is more general and more operational compared with other models. By introducing the L function based on the multivariate extreme theory and the systemically important index, the effect of the size on the systemic importance of a bank is analyzed. The size is found to be a necessary but insufficient condition for measuring the systemic importance of a bank. The size of a bank plays a critical role in evaluating systemic importance, but when the size reaches a certain threshold, its effect is weakened. The current study has theoretical and practical significance for the recognition and supervision of the systemic importance of banks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike other studies that have shown rising income inequality over time, however, we show that asset wealth inequality has actually been declining in recent years, indicating widespread participation in the benefits of economic reforms.

In addition, endogenously identified breaks can be related to episodes of sovereign default.","[Afonso, Antonio] European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Econ, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Afonso, Antonio] Univ Tecn Lisboa, ISEG UTL, UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Dept Econ, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal; [Jalles, Joao Tovar] OECD, Dept Econ, F-75775 Paris 16, France",European Central Bank; Universidade de Lisboa; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Jalles, JT (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",antonio.afonso@ecb.europa.eu; joao.jalles@oecd.org,"Jalles, Joao Tovar/AAA-9923-2019; Afonso, António/B-5954-2009","Jalles, Joao Tovar/0000-0002-7171-5076; Afonso, António/0000-0002-6926-2653",,,,,57,18,18,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2014,41.0,4,,,,,821,847,,10.1007/s10663-013-9240-0,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS6BC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344348900011,0

We extend the classical mean-variance two-fund separation theorem to a three-fund separation theorem. The additional fund is the skewness portfolio, i.e. a portfolio that gives the optimal hedge of the squared market return; it contributes to the skewness risk premium through co-variation with the squared market return and supports a stochastic discount factor that is quadratic in the market return. When the skewness portfolio does not replicate the squared market return, a tracking error appears; this tracking error contributes to risk premiums through kurtosis and pentosis risk if and only if preferences for skewness are heterogeneous. In addition to the common powers of market returns, this tracking error shows up in stochastic discount factors as priced factors that are products of the tracking error and market returns.

I estimate the model parameters using a variant of the two-step estimator developed by Bajari et al. (2007). Using panel data of Japanese firms in the U.S. automobile industry, both activities are found to have significant sunk cost, which introduces intertemporal interactions in decisions, and I also find that the entry costs for FDI are larger than fixed adjustment costs for quality-upgrade. I simulate counterfactuals based on the estimation of the structural model. In the absence of the VERs, both quality-upgrade and the probability of undertaking FDI decrease. The second simulation examines the substitution effect between the two investment activities. The proposal to restrict FDI policy causes a dramatic increase in the level of quality-upgrade. Similarly, the proposal to restrict quality-upgrade policy results in an increase in the probability of FDI. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The agent builds (as economists do) a simplified model of the world which is sparse, considering only the variables of first-order importance. His stylized model and his resulting choices both derive from constrained optimization. Still, the sparse max remains tractable to compute. Moreover, the induced outcomes reflect basic psychological forces governing limited attention. The sparse max yields a behavioral version of basic chapters of the microeconomics textbook: consumer demand and competitive equilibrium. I obtain a behavioral version of Marshallian and Hicksian demand, Arrow-Debreu competitive equilibrium, the Slutsky matrix, the Edgeworth box, Roy's identity, and so on. The Slutsky matrix is no longer symmetric: nonsalient prices are associated with anomalously small demand elasticities. Because the consumer exhibits nominal illusion, in the Edgeworth box, the offer curve is a two-dimensional surface rather than a one-dimensional curve. As a result, different aggregate price levels correspond to materially distinct competitive equilibria, in a similar spirit to a Phillips curve. The Arrow-Debreu welfare theorems typically do not hold. This framework provides a way to assess which parts of basic microeconomics are robust, and which are not, to the assumption of perfect maximization.","NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Gabaix, X (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"Gabaix, Xavier/B-8227-2008",,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1325181] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,81,222,277,2,65,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

However, no program, existing or proposed, requires such continual compliance. Some (e.g. the Acid Rain Program limiting SO2 emissions) require compliance once a year; others (e.g. the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative limiting CO2 emissions) require compliance every three years. The paths of emissions and permit prices would be invariant to compliance timing (Holland-Moore, 2013) if the government never injected additional permits between successive compliance dates. However, virtually all emissions trading programs require such injections through either (1) interim permit auctions or (2) sales from cost containment reserves intended to cap permit prices. In such cases, analyses which abstract from delayed compliance may mislead policy makers. For example, a cost containment reserve judged sufficient to cap prices at a ceiling over a year may sell out in a single day. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These circumstance are also important for the use of single window. I identified how to better use single window by analyzing the factors affecting its use. First, deducted factors affecting the utilization of single window external pressure (demands from trading partners), government support, CEO support, partnership, education and training,. task fit and technology fit. As a second step, I analyzed their effects on the efficiency and effectiveness of single window utilization. This analysis was based on a survey of about 200 companies using single window, and the data was then analyzed with a structural equation model. This led to the formulation of the early model based on the Innovation Diffusion Theory, Technology-Task Fit, Task-Technology Fit and Technology Acceptance Model, and then to the Revised Models 1,2,3 and 4., I came to five important conclusions. First, task fit is enhanced when government support, CEO support and education and training on Single window are enhanced. Second, as a result from Revised Model 1,. task fit is significantly impacted when government support, CEO support, and education and training about single window are enhanced. the more task fit is strengthened, the more business efficiency is strengthened Third, as a result from Revised Model 2, task fit is better when government support, CEO support, and education and training about single window are improved; the more task fit is strengthened, the more business effectiveness is improved Fourth, as a result from Revised Model 3, task fit is more developed, when CEO support and education and training about single window are enhanced; the more task fit is developed, the more business efficiency is strengthened. Fifth, as a result from Revised Model 4, task fit is increased when CEO support and education and training about single window are strengthened; the more task fit is increased, the more business effectiveness is improved. I firmly believe that further research regarding the causal relationship between business task and technology fit and business performance should be conducted in order to enable Korean import and export companies to more effectively and efficiently utilize single window in the future.","[Kim, Chang-Bong] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ Business Adm, Seoul 156756, South Korea; [Lee, Don-Hyun] Chung Ang Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Trade, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Chung Ang University,"Lee, DH (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Trade, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",kim-changbong@hanmail.net; donh-lee@hanmail.net,,,,,,,28,4,4,1,28,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We contribute to the literature by introducing an interaction term between the education Gini coefficient and average years of schooling. In a dynamic panel over 55 years and 134 countries we provide, on the one hand, strong evidence that more schooling is good for growth, but the coefficient is variable and substantially declining in the degree of inequality. The aggregate benefit to education thus depends on a country's position in the education distribution. On the other hand, we find a slight transitional increase in education inequality to be beneficial at a very low average level of schooling, but detrimental for growth at a relatively high average level. Allowing for the macroeconomic return to education to be heterogeneous with respect to the degree of inequality is therefore paramount in understanding the relationship between education and development.","[Sauer, Petra] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Macroecon, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Zagler, Martin] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Alessandria, Italy; [Zagler, Martin] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Sauer, P (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Macroecon, Welthandelspl 1,Bldg D4, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",petra.sauer@wu.ac.at,"Zagler, Martin/C-5677-2016","Zagler, Martin/0000-0003-0863-7375",,,,,50,14,18,4,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Towards this aim, we estimate labor supply elasticities at both extensive and intensive margins for 17 EU countries and the US. Using the same data, inequality aversion is measured as the degree of redistribution implicit in current tax-benefit systems, when these systems are deemed optimal. We find relatively small differences in labor supply elasticities across countries. However, this changes the cross-country ranking in inequality aversion compared to scenarios following the standard approach of using uniform elasticities. Differences in redistributive views are significant between three groups of nations. Labor supply responses are systematically larger at the extensive margin and often larger for the lowest earnings groups, exacerbating the implicit Rawlsian views for countries with traditional social assistance programs. Given the possibility that labor supply responsiveness was underestimated at the time these programs were implemented, we show that such wrong perceptions would lead to less pronounced and much more similar levels of inequality aversion.","[Bargain, Olivier] EHESS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Aix Marseille, France; [Bargain, Olivier] CNRS, Aix Marseille, France; [Bargain, Olivier; Dolls, Mathias; Neumann, Dirk; Peichl, Andreas; Siegloch, Sebastian] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Bargain, Olivier] CEPS INSTEAD, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Dolls, Mathias; Neumann, Dirk; Peichl, Andreas; Siegloch, Sebastian] Univ Cologne, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Cologne,"Peichl, A (通讯作者)，IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",peichl@iza.org,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018; Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019",,,,,,50,13,15,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The process is still ongoing. Our paper tests whether it is likely to be an effective policy. We estimate a gravitational model of bilateral migrations on bilateral exports from the Mediterranean Third Countries (South) to the European Union (North) over the period 1970-2000, using different specifications. We find, in line with most of the literature, a significantly positive correlation (called complementarity) between exports and migrations from the South to the North. Then we go one step further, trying to solve the potential endogeneity problem using average trade tariffs and bilateral exchange rate volatility as instruments for trade. Based on the OLS as well as the 2SLS results, liberalizing trade in the area of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership does not seem to be an effective policy to mitigate the migration flows, at least in the short run.

We conclude that the distribution of FDI in Russian regions depends on market access and can be most notably described by the knowledge-capital framework. Factor endowments built by natural resources are more successful in explaining the location decisions of export-platform affiliates. The impact of natural resources depends on how the availability of these resources is measured. The results reject the crowding out effects of resource FDI and prove co-location mode, when service investments are attracted to resource-rich regions.

The leading explanations for this pattern are that over time, either employers learn about worker productivity but productivity remains fixed or workers' productivities themselves evolve heterogeneously. We propose a dynamic specification that nests both employer learning and dynamic productivity heterogeneity. We estimate this model on a 20-year panel of pay and performance measures from a single, large firm. The advantage of these data is that they provide us with repeat measures of productivity, some of which have not yet been observed by the firm when it sets wages. We use our estimates to investigate how learning and dynamic productivity heterogeneity jointly contribute to the increase in pay dispersion with age. We find that both mechanisms are important for understanding wage dynamics. The dispersion of pay increases with experience primarily because productivity differences increase. Imperfect learning, however, means that wages differ significantly from individual productivity all along the life cycle because firms continuously struggle to learn about a moving target in worker productivity. Our estimates allow us to calculate the degree to which imperfect learning introduces a wedge between the private and social incentives to invest in human capital. We find that these disincentives exist throughout the life cycle but increase rapidly after about 15 years of experience. Thus, in contrast to the existing literature on employer learning, we find that imperfect learning might have especially large effects on investments among older workers.","[Kahn, Lisa B.] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Lange, Fabian] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",Yale University; McGill University,"Kahn, LB (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,48,42,69,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The agents may be subjected to an idiosyncratic or common external influence and also some random noise. The system's stochastic dynamics is studied by numerical simulations. It displays the characteristics of punctuated, multiple equilibria, sensitivity to small details, and path dependence. The dynamics is so slow that one can meaningfully speak of quasi-equilibrium states. Performing measurements of correlations between the agents choices we find that they are random both as to their sign and absolute value, but their distribution is very broad when the interaction dominates both the noise and the external field. This means that random but strong correlations appear with large probability. In the two dimensional model this also implies that the correlations on average fall off with distance very slowly: the system is essentially non-local, small changes at one end may have a strong impact at the other. The strong, random correlations tend to organize a large fraction of the agents into strongly correlated clusters that act together. If we think of this model as a metaphor of social or economic agents or bank networks, the systemic risk implications of this tendency are clear: any impact on even a single strongly correlated agent will not be confined to a small set but will spread, in an unforeseeable manner, to the whole system via the strong random correlations.","[Kondor, Imre] Parmenides Fdn, Munich, Germany; [Csabai, Istvan; Papp, Gabor; Mones, Enys; Czimbalmos, Gabor; Sandor, Mate Cs.] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University,"Kondor, I (通讯作者)，Parmenides Fdn, Munich, Germany.",kondor.imre@gmail.com,"Papp, Gábor/D-1851-2012; Csabai, Istvan/F-6045-2011","Papp, Gábor/0000-0001-5038-678X; Csabai, Istvan/0000-0001-9232-9898; Mones, Enys/0000-0001-7724-0094",,,,,35,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Instead, cuts in marginal labour tax rates are inflationary and become more expansionary when the zero lower bound is binding.

Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation and partial least squares (PLS) regression were used to analyze currency weights. Results suggest that when a producer's currency is devalued relative to a local currency, if the demand elasticity of the importer is large, the local currency will primarily be used; if the bargaining power of the importer is strong, the producer's currency will primarily be used. Among these factors, the bargaining power of the exporter has the greatest influence, followed by the demand elasticity of the importer and the exporting country's exchange rate.

Each agent acts locally but through the links of the network local decisions percolate to the entire population. Past research shows that such a system converges either to an absorbing state (a fixed distribution of actions that once attained does not change) or to an absorbing set (a set of action distributions that may cycle in finite populations or behave chaotically in unbounded populations). In many network games, however, it is uncertain which situation emerges. In this paper I identify two fundamental network characteristics, boundary consistency and neighborhood overlap, that determine the outcome of all symmetric, binary-choice, network games. In quasi-consistent networks these games converge to an absorbing state regardless of the initial distribution of actions, and the degree to which neighborhoods overlap impacts the number and composition of those absorbing states.

A two-sector model with endogenous relative sector sizes is developed to formally show that under certain conditions the debt sustainability, measured as the limiting value of the debt-to-GDP ratio, of transition economies exceeds that of mature market economies. This 'advantage' comes from structural factors: sectoral imbalances of growth and shifts in sectoral composition of GDP. Furthermore, among transition economies those with relatively higher structural flexibility can sustain relatively higher debt-to-GDP ratios. How much debt relative to GDP a country can sustain is shown to be highly context specific and depends on the economic structure, composition of growth, structural flexibility, and the prevailing incentives for restructuring. But should a country carry a high debt level relative to GDP just because it can? The paper answers this question by distinguishing between two categories of transition economies: Those that could and should and those that could but should not exploit their capacity to sustain high debt levels.

The consumers lack confidence about the probability model that characterizes the stochastic environment and so apply a max-min operator to their optimization problem. An altruistic fiscal authority does not face this Knightian uncertainty. We show analytically that, in responding to consumer uncertainty, the government no longer sets the expected capital tax rate exactly equal to zero, as is the case in the full-confidence benchmark model. Rather, our numerical results indicate that the government chooses to subsidize capital income, albeit at a modest rate. We also show that the government responds to consumer uncertainty by smoothing the labor tax across states and by making the labor tax persistent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using a unique self-collected dataset, this paper estimates returns to dialect familiarity in China's largest and most developed city, Shanghai. We evaluate migrant workers' comprehension and fluency of the Shanghai dialect, and instrument their dialect fluency by determining whether the workers' hometowns were located in the Wu dialect region and the distance between those hometowns and Shanghai. We determined that in OLS regressions, the returns to dialect are a consequence of endogeneity bias. After using IV (instrumental variable), dialect fluency was shown to significantly impact one's income in the service industry, in particular affecting sales jobs. In manufacturing and construction jobs, migrants with higher dialect fluency tended to be self-employed in order to earn more income. By distinguishing between listening and speaking abilities, we found that auditory comprehension does not significantly increase one's earning, while oral fluency does. Since local residents in Shanghai can understand Mandarin, migrants who can understand Shanghainese won't have difficulty in the information exchange. Therefore, our results confirm that dialect is a channel through which people expose their identity. Speaking the local dialect is a way for migrant workers to integrate into the local society and also to reduce transaction costs in the labor market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Through an examination of 34 years of daily and annual returns for the S&P500 and 13 years of returns for popular ETFs, I have demonstrated the existence of the First Day of Quarter (FDQ) effect. By trading only four days a year from the beginning of 2000 until the end of 2013, an investor could have gained 113.1% of the S&P500 returns for that period, while being exposed to stock risk for only 56 days. Moreover, for 11 of those 14 years of trading, the FDQ was responsible for more than 10% of the annual returns. Only for two years since 2000 (2001, 2005) has the FDQ yielded a negative return. The biggest beneficiary of the FDQ is the financial sector, which for the last 13 years of investing has been non-fertile, showing -6.12% total return. Investing only at the beginning of each quarter for a total of 52 days would have yielded a return of 40.17%. The next beneficiary of the FDQ is the technological sector. The 82.5% of total return gained in this sector over the last 13 years could have been gained in only 52 days of trading. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Subjects must choose between two routes-Road and Metro. The travel cost on the road is increasing in the number of commuters who choose this route, while the travel cost on the metro is decreasing in the number of its users. We examine how changes to the road capacity, the number of commuters, and the metro pricing scheme influence the commuters' route-choice behavior. According to the Downs-Thomson paradox, improved road capacity increases travel times along both routes because it attracts more users to the road and away from the metro, thereby worsening both services. A change in route design generates two Nash equilibria; and the resulting coordination problem is amplified even further when the number of commuters is large. We find that, similar to other binary choice experiments with congestion effects, aggregate traffic flows are close to the equilibrium levels, but systematic individual differences persist over time.","[Dechenaux, Emmanuel] Kent State Univ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Mago, Shakun D.] Univ Richmond, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Razzolini, Laura] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; University of Richmond; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Mago, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Richmond, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",edechena@kent.edu; sdatta@richmond.edu; lrazzolini@vcu.edu,,"Razzolini, Laura/0000-0002-2934-1752; Mago, Shakun/0000-0001-9616-3151; Dechenaux, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4734-0793","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0904695] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,30,15,18,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

One important element of these reforms is the introduction of an unbundling process, i.e., the separation of the competitive activities of supply and production from the monopole activity of transmission and distribution of electricity. There are several forms of unbundling: functional, legal and ownership. New Zealand, for instance, adopted an ownership unbundling in 1998. As discussed in the literature, ownership unbundling produces benefits and costs. One of the benefits may be an improvement in the level of the productive efficiency of the companies due to the use of the inputs in just one activity and a greater level of transparency for the regulator. This paper analyzes the cost efficiency of 28 electricity distribution companies in New Zealand for the period between 1996 and 2011. Using a stochastic frontier panel data model, a total cost function and a variable cost function are estimated in order to evaluate the impact of ownership unbundling on the level of cost efficiency. The results indicate that ownership separation of electricity generation and retail operations from the distribution network has a positive effect on the cost efficiency of distribution companies in New Zealand. The estimated effect of ownership separation suggests a positive average one-off shift in the level of cost efficiency by 0.242 in the short-run and 0.144 in the long-run. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a firm-level survey data, we examined the kind of spillovers occurring, extent of occurrence as well as the channels through which such spillovers occurred. The results obtained showed that the main kinds of spillovers occurring were product and process spillovers followed by marketing, management and organisation. Results of t-tests analysis showed significant differences between competition and demonstration, and linkage and labour mobility implying that the first two mechanisms were extremely important in spillover occurrence compared with the latter two in the Kenyan context. These have implications that linkage and labour mobility have weaker learning effects, hence weak in stimulating capability building. T-test analysis showed that more spillovers occurred from foreign firms than from locally owned firms. The results also showed that spillovers were likely to occur due to foreign presence, firm and machine age, skill level, research and development, training and participation in imports. Based on the results generated, the paper portends that foreign direct investment can play an important role in the country's manufacturing industry by stimulating learning and capability development via spillover occurrence.","Univ Dubai, Dept Econ & Stat, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",University of Dubai,"Gachino, GG (通讯作者)，Univ Dubai, Dept Econ & Stat, POB 14143, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",geoffrey.gachino@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,3,3,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Our theoretical explanations suggest that the energy-transformation from fossil fuel to electricity by electrification could cause a decrease in the short-term level of productivity but an increase in the long-term rate of productivity growth in firms. Our empirical evidence from a large panel of Korean manufacturing plants is generally consistent with the theoretical predictions on the relatedness of technological knowledge by the electrification to the level and rate effects of the firm's productivity. The electrification measured by the share of electricity results in lowering the short-term productivity level but in raising the long-term rate of productivity growth of firms.

Continuous time wavelets help to circumvent the problems associated to basic linear regressions and given that stock-oil relationships are usually described as complicated we extend previous findings by providing more generalized and convincing results, in analyzing contagion and interdependence issues as well as lead and lag effects for both world general and sector stock levels between December 1992 and October 2012. The relationship between oil prices and sector stock returns is ambiguous, because results seem to show that there are both phase and anti-phase relationships, where mostly it is oil that is the lagging variable, independently of the sector under analysis. There is higher coherence among series for higher scales thus supporting the interdependence hypothesis, showing that long run market dynamics are more uncertain. Empirical results indicate a bidirectional relationship between both series for large time horizons, which can be associated to fundamentalist traders, especially fund managers and institutional investors, and which depend on the historical period under analysis.

The Great Moderation is modeled according to the data properties of consumption and dividend growth rates, which display a reduction of their innovation-volatility and increased persistence: the latter is a characteristic that has been largely unaddressed in the literature. The theoretical model (a long-run risk model) is calibrated to match average asset pricing variables, as well as consumption and dividend dynamics before and during the Great Moderation. The model captures the relevant features of the Great Moderation (decreased variance, increased persistence, asset prices). It predicts only a modest welfare gain from Great Moderation (0.38 percent in consumption equivalent), due mainly to the utility cost of a late uncertainty resolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The framework allows a decomposition of the deadweight loss from each tax instrument into the losses stemming from the contraction of the different tax bases. The paper describes a method of calibrating the model which exploits the links between the various factor supply elasticities implied by the standard life cycle model. It also presents a method of estimating effective tax rates that is consistent with optimising household and firm behaviour. To illustrate how the model works, it is calibrated to a data set for Sweden. The quantitative results indicate that more than half of the marginal deadweight loss from taxes on capital may stem from their negative impact on the tax bases for labour income and consumption.

While the literature often argues that crises are accompanied by growing protectionism, we observe a substantially more complex relation. We find that crises as a rule result in an increase in integration rhetoric and can also result in an increase in actual economic and institutional integration. However, the actual integration effort goes up only when a crisis has followed a prolonged period of economic growth, i.e. the countries have accumulated sufficient reserves. At the same time, the existing ties must be strong, with no viable alternative available to the policy makers. Otherwise there is too strong an incentive to use protectionist measures to compensate for the decrease in budgetary revenue.","[Vinokurov, Evgeny] Eurasian Dev Bank, Ctr Integrat Studies, St Petersburg, Russia; [Libman, Alexander] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Libman, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.",alibman@yandex.ru,"Vinokurov, Evgeny/F-1668-2014","Vinokurov, Evgeny/0000-0002-9584-3494; Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007",,,,,64,11,11,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,SEP,2014,26.0,3,,,,,341,358,,10.1080/14631377.2014.937094,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AO7HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341523600003,0

We use the Campbell-Shiller present value formula to decompose the price-rent ratio into the present discounted values of expected future housing market fundamentals, i.e., rent growth, real interest rate and risk premium for investing in housing. Treating the expectations of the fundamentals as unobserved components, we cast the Campbell-Shiller formula into a state-space model and estimate the deep parameters by maximum likelihood method. It is found that that the variations in the price-rent ratio are mostly due to the expected housing premium, while the expected rent growth and real interest rate account for only small fractions of variations in the price-rent ratio. It is also found that, while the individual contributions of the expected market fundamentals sum up much larger variations than in the price-rent ratio itself, the correlations among them considerably dampen fluctuations in the ratio.","[Kim, Jangryoul; Lim, Gieyoung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, Seoul 130791, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Lim, G (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",gylim@hufs.ac.kr,,,,,,,8,9,10,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We also compare this policy with the introduction of a single open-ended labour contract with increasing severance payments for all new hires. We use an equilibrium search and matching model to generate the main properties of this segmented labour market Our steady-state results show that this reform will reduce unemployment (by 10.5%) and job destruction (by 7.5%). However, in terms of wage subsidies, the cost of implementing this reform will be very high. A cheaper and more effective way to decrease the duality in the labour market could be to eliminate temporary contracts and introduce a single contract. Unemployment and job destruction in this case could be reduced by 31.5% and 35%, respectively. Most interestingly, tenure distribution could be even smoother than under the designed reform, as 22.5% more workers could have tenures of more than three years and there could be 38.5% fewer one-year contracts. The transition shows that both policy measures would benefit a majority of workers: only 7.4% would experience a decrease in tenure under the approved reform (5.5% in the transition to the single contract) due to the improvement in job stability.

This paper presents a political economy model in which politicians compete for taxpayers' and government employees' votes by promising compensation packages, but some voters cannot evaluate every aspect of promised compensation. If pension packages are shrouded, so that public-sector workers better understand their value than ordinary taxpayers, then compensation will be highly back-loaded. In equilibrium, the welfare of public-sector workers could be improved, holding total public-sector costs constant, if they received higher wages and lower pensions. Centralizing pension determination has two offsetting effects on generosity: more state-level media attention helps taxpayers better understand pension costs, and that reduces pension generosity; but a larger share of public-sector workers will vote within the jurisdiction, which increases pension generosity. A short discussion of pensions in two decentralized states (California and Pennsylvania) and two centralized states (Massachusetts and Ohio) suggests that centralization appears to have modestly reduced pensions, but, as the model suggests, this is unlikely to be universal.

To the extent that training is a significant source of human capital and industry competitiveness, our results suggest that increasing training is an important channel through which competition raises productivity.

The methodology used to undertake this analysis is based on the TradeCAN approach developed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), which provides a means of assessing different countries' competitiveness by looking at their exports to the fastest-growing markets. (In the past, it has usually been applied primarily to exports of goods.) The results suggest that, although some Latin American countries have made inroads in knowledge-intensive service segments and have comparative advantages in them, the percentage of rising stars (dynamic sectors in which a country or region is gaining in market share) is still low, while there is a high percentage of missed opportunities (dynamic sectors in which a country or region is losing market share). This points up the existence of areas in which the region's competitive position is weak and in which policies are needed to leverage its competitive advantages and remove the obstacles that are holding it back from establishing a more advantageous position in knowledge-intensive service markets.","[Niembro, Andres] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Interdisciplinary Terr Econ & Societal Res Ctr CI, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Niembro, Andres] Natl Council Sci & Technol Res CONICET, Rio Negro, Argentina",,,anlopez@fund-cenit.org.ar; aniembro@unrn.edu.ar; danielaramos@fund-cenit.org.ar,,,,,,,53,6,6,2,15,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2014,,113,,,,,21,39,,,,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AU9BM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345886800002,0

A methodology that has not been used previously to identify clusters is applied to data on inter-industry linkages from the input-output table of a region in northern Spain. The first advantage of this approach, hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC), over the use of factorial analysis alone, is that it involves the application of objective clustering techniques to the principal components analysis results, which leads to a better cluster solution. A second advantage is derived from using a mixed algorithm for the clustering process - a combination of the Ward's classification method with the K-means algorithm - which improves the robustness of the final results.","[Argueelles, M.; Benavides, C.; Fernandez, I.] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Argüelles, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",marguel@uniovi.es,,,,,,,28,43,49,1,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main research findings are fivefold. First, dominant numbers of researchers are involved in convergence technology with IT because IT is recognized as the most competitive technology in Korea. Second, mobility of researchers is active in convergence technologies. Third, it is found that the researchers in convergence technologies are more productive in terms of the number of research papers per capita than those in other scientific fields. Fourth, they, however, show limited research collaboration, compared with their high productivity. Finally, the members of the network in convergence technologies are closer to each other than those in other scientific fields, but most of their collaborative relationships remain bilateral rather than triangular. Only a few researchers act as hubs, revealing that collaborative research relationship in convergence technologies in Korea is highly concentrated.

A growing body of empirical evidence indicates that increases in the minimum wage have a displacement effect on low-skilled workers. Economic reasoning provides the possibility that disemployment may cause youth to substitute from legal work to crime. However, there is also the countervailing effect of a higher wage raising the opportunity cost of crime for those who remain employed. We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort to measure the effect of increases in the minimum wage on self-reported criminal activity and examine employment-crime substitution. Exploiting changes in state and federal minimum wage laws from 1997 to 2010, we find that workers who are affected by a change in the minimum wage are more likely to commit crime, become idle, and lose employment. Individuals experiencing a binding minimum wage change were more likely to commit crime and work only part time. Analyzing heterogeneity shows those with past criminal connections are especially likely to see decreased employment and increased crime following a policy change, suggesting that reduced employment effects dominate any wage effects. The findings have implications for policy regarding both the low-wage labor market and efforts to deter criminal activity.","[Beauchamp, Andrew] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Chan, Stacey] Anal Grp, Denver, CO USA",Boston College; Analysis Group Inc.,"Beauchamp, A (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",beauchaa@bc.edu; chansl@bc.edu,,,,,,,20,10,10,3,58,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Instead of the usual purely deterministic trend we introduce a non-stationary independent increment process for the low-frequency dynamics, and model the large fluctuations by a non-Gaussian stable CARMA process. The model allows for analytic futures prices, and we apply these to model and estimate the whole market consistently. Besides standard parameter estimation, an estimation procedure is suggested, where we fit the non-stationary trend using futures data with long time until delivery, and a robust L-1-filter to find the states of the CARMA process. The procedure also involves the empirical and theoretical risk premia which - as a by-product - are also estimated. We apply this procedure to data from the German electricity exchange EEX, where we split the empirical analysis into base load and peak load prices. We find an overall negative risk premium for the base load futures contracts, except for contracts close to delivery, where a small positive risk premium is detected. Peak load contracts, on the other hand, show a clear positive risk premium, when they are close to delivery, while contracts in the longer end also have a negative premium. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Some observers have found it hard to understand the common elements of the laureates' research, preferring to highlight areas of disagreement among them. In this paper, I argue that empirical asset pricing is a coherent enterprise, which owes much to the laureates' influential contributions, and that important themes in the literature can best be understood by considering the laureates in pairs. Specifically, after summarizing modern asset-pricing theory using the stochastic discount factor as an organizing framework, I discuss the following: the joint hypothesis problem in tests of market efficiency, which is as much an opportunity as a problem (Fama and Hansen); patterns of short- and long-term predictability in asset returns (Fama and Shiller); and models of deviations from rational expectations (Hansen and Shiller). I conclude by reviewing the ways in which the laureates have already influenced the practice of finance, and how they might influence future innovations.","[Campbell, John Y.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Campbell, John Y.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Campbell, JY (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",john_campbell@harvard.edu,,"Campbell, John/0000-0002-1602-3368",,,,,186,17,18,0,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

The ensuing Hidden Markov Decision Tree (HMDT) model is in fact an extension of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) introduced by Jordan et al. (1997). The architecture of this model is the opposite that of the classical deterministic approach based on a binary decision tree and, it allows a probabilistic vision of the relationship between univariate volatility and correlation. Our results are categorized into three groups, namely (1) exchange rates and oil, (2) S&P500 indices, and (3) precious metals. A switching dynamics is seen to characterize the volatilities, while, in the case of the correlations, the series switch from one regime to another, this movement touching a peak during the period of the Subprime crisis in the US, and again during the days following the Tohoku earthquake in Japan. Our findings show that the relationships between volatility and correlation are dependent upon the nature of the series considered, sometimes corresponding to those found in econometric studies, according to which correlation increases in bear markets, at other times differing from them.

The results suggest that migration and remittances have an important significant effect on the GDP of the countries under study. Of the skill categories, the unskilled category has the largest robust indirect effect on GDP. The effects of migration on GDP by country of destination suggest that migration to the Middle East has a robust and significant impact on GDP.

The growth of these MFIs has enabled greater access to credit in many of the world's less developed nations. However, recent studies have shown that very many of the poor - especially Muslims - remain unbanked. Confounding this problem in many Muslim countries is the poor's propensity to reject microfinance, when available, on religious grounds. In this paper we develop an alternative microfinance model which aims to establish credit unions for the poor in which the bank plays the role of a guarantor in the familiar rotating savings and credit association (RoSCA). We test the performance of this model against a stylized sequential Grameen-style microcredit provision in a laboratory experiment in the field conducted in poor Egyptian villages. Our model of bank-insured RoSCAs is shown to solve coordination-failure problems that may otherwise prevent the spontaneous development of informal RoSCAs in practice. Empirically, our bank-insured RoSCA model generated significantly higher takeup and repayment rates than the Grameen model. This suggests that this model, by overcoming the religious barriers to credit, can be a useful alternative to Grameen-style microfinance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This research is the first to present estimates of the association in workless spells across generations for two new cohorts and to consider the important role of local labour market conditions in driving the intergenerational relationship. In recent cohorts, sons with workless fathers spend 11% more time out of work than sons with employed fathers from leaving full-time education to age 23. This estimate increases to 16% when focussing on later periods of adulthood (23-29). Intergenerational worklessness increases with unemployment: sons in low unemployment labour markets have similar workless experiences, regardless of their father's employment status in childhood, whilst sons in high unemployment labour markets spend up to 30% more time out of work if their father is workless rather than employed in childhood.","Univ London, Dept Quantitat Social Sci, Inst Educ, London WC1H 0AL, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Macmillan, L (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Quantitat Social Sci, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.",L.Macmillan@ioe.ac.uk,"Macmillan, Lindsey/B-1840-2016","Macmillan, Lindsey/0000-0003-1262-303X",,,,,28,31,33,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

I introduce technology adoption and schooling decisions into a standard growth model and show that the required differences in barriers implied by this model are much smaller. In particular, a calibrated version of the model implies per capita income differences 3 times larger than a standard model. Per capita income differences are amplified by two reinforcing factors: schooling capital differences and aggregate total factor productivity differences. The results suggest caution in the role of factor inputs derived from standard development accounting exercises. A development policy that subsidizes education is not optimal in the presence of barriers to capital accumulation, removing barriers can replicate educational outcomes and generate higher income levels by several orders of magnitude.

Under uninsurable investment risk, entrepreneurs have to largely rely on self-financing so that, when productivity growth rises, entrepreneurs increase saving to finance new investment. The key insight is that saving has to increase more than investment to also allow for the accumulation of precautionary assets that entrepreneurs hold for self-insurance against investment risk. Numerical simulations show that this net saving increase can generate a current account improvement in line with the empirical evidence.

Our findings suggest a weak dependence between oil prices and stock indices for most cases, which are consistent with the results from previous studies. Exceptions are for the stock index returns of large oil consuming and producing countries (United States and Canada), which are shown to have a relatively strong dependence with the oil price series.

A multivariate probit is estimated for health insurance demand and lifestyle decisions to take into account the potential endogeneity of these decisions. The results indicate that there is evidence of exante moral hazard in deciding to do sports and eating healthy snacks. Hence, no propitious selection has been found for these decisions. Another relevant result shows that there is no individual heterogeneity for the lifestyle choices, except for smoking, and private health insurance choice. Evidence from the results also supports the idea that there are nonobservable variables playing a role in the lifestyle decisions.

Pertinent features of our model are that it is estimated in WTP-space and that the class-specific WTP distributions are truncated to be within the bounds deduced from the cost level(s) within each class-specific consideration set. Our analysis shows that our approach is well suited at uncovering the heterogeneity in the cost thresholds and cut-offs used by respondents. This is shown to help build a richer insight into respondent's behaviour as well as raise a number of concerns about the appropriateness of assuming deterministic choice sets.

It accounted for 12% of GDP in 2009 and has colossal socio-economic implications for the country. However, the inflows of foreign exchange earnings can exert adverse effects on the international competitiveness of an economy as postulated by the Dutch Disease theory. Using Johansen Cointegration and Vector Error Correction Model and annual data from 1971 to 2008, this paper investigates the effects of remittances on the external trade competitiveness as measured by the movements of real exchange rate of the country. The results of the study suggest that the influx of workers' remittances significantly appreciates the real exchange rate and deteriorates the external trade competitiveness of Bangladesh. While increased terms of trade indicates similar adverse effects, openness in goods and capital markets and nominal devaluation improve the trade competitiveness of the country. Therefore, greater trade openness and channelling remittances to the priority investment projects can be powerful policy devices to improve the external competitiveness and avert 'Dutch Disease' in Bangladesh.","[Chowdhury, Mamta B.; Rabbi, Fazle] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Chowdhury, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",mamta.chowdhury@uws.edu.au,"Chowdhury, Mamta B/AAD-7204-2022",,,,,,40,25,25,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This paper uses the rise in mass violence between 1870 and 1940 as an historical experiment for determining the impact of ethnic and political violence on economic activity, namely patenting. I find that violent acts account for more than 1,100 missing patents compared to 726 actual patents among African American inventors over this period. Valuable patents decline in response to major riots and segregation laws. Absence of the rule of law covaries with declines in patent productivity for white and black inventors, but this decline is significant only for African American inventors. Patenting responds positively to declines in violence. These findings imply that ethnic and political conflict may affect the level, direction, and quality of invention and economic growth over time.","Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Cook, LD (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",lisacook@msu.edu,,,,,,,136,48,60,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Relying on a formal theoretical framework and recent panel cointegration techniques, our findings show that current accounts have been globally sustainable in Sub-Saharan Africa countries over the 1980-2011 period. However, this sustainability has been lower for countries operating a fixed exchange rate regime or belonging to a monetary union.

It is highly capital-intensive and maintaining production, especially of oil and gas, will absorb a large share of business investment over the next 5-10 years. The volatility of revenues from the sector means that an independent Scotland will face much greater difficulties in macro-economic management than as part of the UK. Attempting to fix its exchange rate, either to the pound sterling or the euro, without a system of compensating fiscal transfers will put the burden of adjustment on factor mobility and incomes. Scotland could use a sovereign wealth fund as a stabilizing instrument, but it is starting from a much worse position than Norway and would need to reduce current government spending to build up the fund. The prospects for exporting gas and electricity to the rest of the UK depend upon the terms of access to markets. It seems unlikely that integrated Great Britain markets will survive in their current form. Large exports will continue but the net terms of trade will probably be less favourable to Scotland than at present.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Hughes, G (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",g.a.hughes@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,4,2,2,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The financial intermediaries in our model are required to make investment commitments before a complete resolution of idiosyncratic funding risk that can be addressed only by costly refinancing, forcing them to behave in a risk-averse manner. The model shows that the balance sheet condition of intermediaries can drive asset values away from their fundamentals, causing aggregate investment and output to respond to shocks to intermediaries. We use this model to evaluate several public policies designed to address balance sheet problems at financial institutions. With regard to short-run policies, we find that capital injections conditioned upon voluntary recapitalization can be a more effective tool than asset purchases. With regard to long-run policies, we demonstrate that higher capital requirements can have sizable short-run effects on economic activity, and that a long transition period helps avoid undesirable side effects. Finally, we show that the marginal effects of policies can be larger during crises because of the nonlinear interactions between some financial frictions and policy actions.

I build a model in which regions that are heterogeneous in initial endowments try to attract capital by competing public input that enhances the productivity of capital; meanwhile, a fiscal equalization system is imposed by the central government to reduce regional disparities in fiscal capacity. The key prediction, borne out in data from the German equalization system, is that while competition for capital strengthens discipline in the well-endowed regions, it weakens discipline in the poorly endowed regions. However, a conventional equalization transfer scheme, common to many countries, can be effective in correcting the distortion driven by the heterogeneity of initial endowments across competing regions.","Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Liu, YZ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",yliu39@gsu.edu,,,,,,,53,15,15,4,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

However, post Keynesian economists have long argued that banks make loans first, create deposits in the process, and then look for reserves. Hence, deposits make reserves. The study revisits this post Keynesian theory with a new insight into large New York banks that act as intermediaries (as primary dealers in the textbook case, and as correspondent banks in the post Keynesian case) between the Fed and the nation's banking sector. The Granger causality tests and estimated short-run adjustment dynamics provide unambiguously strong empirical evidence in favor of the post Keynesian theory and the study's new insight, that is, the deposit creation process begins at banks, and large New York banks are indeed effective intermediaries between the Fed and the nation's banking sector.","Woodbury Univ, Burbank, CA 91504 USA",,"Nishiyama, Y (通讯作者)，Woodbury Univ, Burbank, CA 91504 USA.",,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

This should hold because the organizational scope, centralization, and policymaking integration of labor and capital facilitates the creation of post-industrial political coalitions necessary for egalitarian policymaking and implementation by progressive governments, and organizationally blunts insider politics by sectorally fragmented actors and excessive rent-seeking by narrow interest groups. I draw on 1975 to 2011 annual data from 18 post-industrial democracies and estimate models of labor market policy and performance. Findings support the core argument: social democratic government has significant egalitarian impacts on policies and performance at high levels of labor and employer organization. Some conventional explanations of dualism also receive support: technological change, trade penetration by developing countries, and deindustrialization are associated with inegalitarian outcomes.","Marquette Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Marquette University,"Swank, D (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",,,,,,,,67,2,2,0,17,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In contrast to the US and the UK, this period was also characterised by a substantial increase in the educational attainment of the labour force. This paper investigates whether differences in the timing of educational expansion over the last forty years can explain the divergent evolution of upper tail wage inequality in France relative to other countries. Using a model with imperfect substitution between experience groups, the estimates suggest that the rapid increase in the supply of educated workers during the 1970s and 1990s produced a substantial decline in the skill premium within cohorts. As a result, between a third and half of the decline in wage inequality at the top of the distribution in France during this period is explained by the increase in the educational attainment of the labour force.

We use quarterly data on real gross domestic product, real house prices, real gross fixed capital formation and number of building plans passed. Our data span 1971Q2-2012Q2. Using full sample bootstrap Granger causality tests, we find a uni-directional causality from output to number of building plans passed; a uni-directional causality from real house price to output and a bi-directional causal link between residential investment and output. However, using parameter stability tests, we show that estimated VARs are unstable, thus full-sample Granger causality inference may be invalid. Hence, we use a bootstrap rolling window estimation to evaluate Granger causality between the housing variables and the growth rate. In general, we find that the causality from housing to output and, vice versa, differ across different sample periods due to structural changes. Specifically speaking, house price is found to have the strongest causal relationship with output compared to residential investment and number of building plans passed, with real house price showing predictive ability in all but one downward phase of the business cycle during this period.

The first innovation is the development of a two-stage model using publicly available pre-release indicators to predict (1) initial week and (2) subsequent run box office revenues. To incorporate the experience-good nature of movies, the second stage is estimated by incorporating a proxy variable for box office success during the first week relative to predicted first week success. The second contribution is an empirical test of De Vany and Walls' (J Econ Dyn Control 28:1035-1057, 2004) finding that the distribution of movie revenues has heavy tails and follows a non-Gaussian stable distribution with infinite variance. We estimate the two-stage model of a movie's box office success on all general release movies in 1 year with both the Gaussian and stable distribution with heavy tails and infinite variance and find no evidence for the stable distribution in either stage of the estimation. This two-stage model is validated by comparing all general release movies in 3 future years (out-of-sample data) to the model's predictions.","[Derrick, Frederick W.; Williams, Nancy A.; Scott, Charles E.] Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA",Loyola University Maryland,"Williams, NA (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",nwilliams@loyola.edu,,,,,,,36,9,11,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This finding contrasts with the representation theorem of Dubra, Maccheroni and Ok [16] which typically delivers some functions which do not respect strict preferences. For a preference relation of the sort that I consider in this paper, my representation theorem reduces the problem of recovering the associated choice correspondence over convex sets of lotteries to a scalar-valued, parametric optimization exercise. By utilizing this scalarization method, I also provide characterizations of some solution concepts. Most notably, I show that in an otherwise standard game with incomplete preferences, the collection of pure strategy equilibria that one can find using this scalarization method corresponds to a refinement of the notion of Nash equilibrium that requires the (deterministic) action of each player be not worse than any mixed strategy that she can follow, given others' actions.

J,"Freeman, A",,,,"Freeman, Alan",,,Schumpeter's theory of self-restoration: a casualty of Samuelson's Whig historiography of science,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,History of thought; Schumpeter; Innovation; Value,,"This article argues that Samuelson's influential 1987 call for a 'Whig history of economic science' rests on a Whig historiography of the natural sciences. This contrasts with how science actually works: Samuelson neglects the critical role of controversy in the development of knowledge, leading to the misleading idea that scientists pursue discovery at the expense of reflection on the foundation and history of their subject. The consequence is institutional delegitimation: the exclusion of legitimate contrary hypotheses when economists test their theories, invalidating the test. Samuelson further confuses the history of ideas with the history of texts. This expands the scope of institutional delegitimation to a systematic misrepresentation of the actual ideas at stake in the economic controversies, erecting a permanent obstacle to the discovery of truth. I illustrate this with Samuelson's exclusion from consideration of two 'non-ignorable' contributions to macroeconomic theory: Schumpeter's Business Cycles, which he failed to recognise as a theory of endogenous capitalist self-restoration, and the concept of endogenous decline, excluded by his Whig reinterpretation of Marx's theory of value. Schumpeter and Marx offered opposed, but legitimate, alternatives to the post-war macroeconomic consensus of which Samuelson was a major architect. In particular, both recognised that deep and prolonged crises were a natural product of capitalism, not an inexplicable exception. To respond to the 2008 downturn, economics needs to reopen a wide discussion without excluding, a priori, any of these opposed theoretical explanations, instead seeking to understand clearly what each of them actually says and testing them against the empirical evidence of history.","[Freeman, Alan] London Metropolitan Univ, London, England",London Metropolitan University,"Freeman, A (通讯作者)，994 Grosvenor Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3M 0N6, Canada.",afreeman@iwgvt.org,"Freeman, Alan/Q-6893-2019",,,,,,41,6,6,2,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Specifically, it examines whether reserves affect the share of foreign portfolio equity investment (PEI) in total foreign equity investment, which includes both PEI and foreign direct investment (FDI). Foreign investors' decisions regarding the location and the type of equity capital investment might be influenced by a country's level of international reserves. In a simple theoretical model, it is shown that higher reserves, thanks to their ability to lower exchange rate risk, reduce the risk premium of PEI. Hence, higher reserves are expected to increase the inflow of PEI relative to FDI. This hypothesis is tested for a sample of 76 developing countries during the period 1980-2010 using different estimation methods, model specifications and data samples. The results suggest that higher levels of reserves are associated with a larger share of PEI relative to FDI. This result points to a collateral benefit of reserves that has been neglected so far. Reserves may contribute to develop domestic financial markets and facilitate domestic firms' access to foreign portfolio equity financing. In addition, this paper finds a strong negative effect of the global financial crisis beginning in 2008 on the share of PEI, which confirms the hypothesis that PEI is more crisis-dependent than FDI.","[Qian, Xingwang] SUNY Coll Buffalo, Econ & Finance Dept, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA; [Steiner, Andreas] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Empir Econ Res, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Buffalo State College; University Osnabruck,"Qian, XW (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Buffalo, Econ & Finance Dept, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",qianx@buffalostate.edu; asteiner@uni-osnabrueck.de,,"Steiner, Andreas/0000-0001-9272-3262",,,,,70,10,12,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Earnings insecurity is proxied by transitory variability in earnings, which captures transitory earnings shocks, and by earnings volatility, which captures both permanent and transitory earnings shocks. Our results suggest that corporative bargaining systems, generous unemployment benefits, and deregulated product markets reduce the impact of macroeconomic shocks on transitory variability in earnings and earnings volatility, while a stronger labor protection legislation reduces the impact of macroeconomic shocks on earnings volatility. Several institutional mixes have the potential to reduce transitory variability, for example coupling a high corporatism with a high unionization, coupling protection mechanisms with activation policies, incorporating a trade-off between the generosity of unemployment benefits and the strictness of labor market regulation, and coupling product market deregulation with deregulated labor markets or with a high unionization. Two valuable lessons are that contextual interaction effects are important for understanding the influence of particular policies and institutions on earnings insecurity and that there is no one-size-fits all policy package for reducing the impact of the business cycle on transitory variability and volatility.","[Sologon, Denisa Maria] CEPS INSTEAD, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Sologon, Denisa Maria] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Sologon, Denisa Maria; O'Donoghue, Cathal] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Sologon, DM (通讯作者)，CEPS INSTEAD, Ave Fonte 3, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",denisa.sologon@ceps.lu,"O’Donoghue, Cathal/AAW-4109-2021","O’Donoghue, Cathal/0000-0003-3713-5366; Sologon, Denisa Maria/0000-0002-0309-5952",,,,,69,5,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

While the relationship between economic benefits and support for European integration has already been empirically investigated, this is not the case for European identity. Therefore, we test the association between economic indicators and European identity, while performing the same analysis for support for European integration. Eight different objective and perceived economic parameters are tested, covering the whole spectrum of sociotropic, egocentric, objective and perceived benefits. The multilevel analyses on Eurobarometer data show that economic considerations are positively associated with support and European identity.

We construct a simple model with two locations and two industries (clean and dirty) where pollution is a by-product of dirty good manufacturing. Under proper assumptions, a completely stratified configuration with all dirty firms clustering in one city emerges as the only equilibrium outcome when there is a fixed cost component of the pollution tax. Whereas the fixed component of the pollution tax and decreasing private returns are needed for agglomeration of dirty firms, the Romer-type positive spillovers are not necessary. Moreover, a stratified Pareto optimum can never be supported by a competitive spatial equilibrium with a linear pollution tax that encompasses Pigouvian taxation as a special case. To support such a stratified Pareto optimum, however, an effective but unconventional policy prescription is to redistribute the pollution tax revenue from the dirty to the clean city residents.","[Berliant, Marcus; Wang, Ping] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Peng, Shin-Kun] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Peng, Shin-Kun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Wang, Ping] Acad Sinica, NBER, Cambridge, MA USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Berliant, M (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 1208,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",berliant@artsci.wustl.edu,,,,,,,25,6,8,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

I develop an open economy model with endowment and preference shocks that can account for the empirical behavior of real exchange rates, interest rates and consumption in the U.S. and Europe. The model includes cross border holdings of bonds and equity, and financial frictions that impede international risk-sharing. I find that external adjustment following endowment shocks predominantly takes place via trade flows, consistent with the intertemporal approach to the current account. In contrast, preference shocks that change investors' risk aversion induce adjustment via the trade and valuation channels; where the latter includes the effects of unexpected capital gains and loss on existing cross border holdings and changes in the expected future return differentials between foreign assets and liabilities. The model estimates imply that the valuation channel of external adjustment is more important for the U.S. than the trade channel. Consistent with this implication, I show that forecasts of future return differentials contributed most to the volatility of the U.S. net foreign asset position in the post Bretton-Woods era.

First, relying on Ottaviano and Van Ypersele's (J. Int. Econ. 67:25-46, 2005) foot-loose capital model of tax competition, we illustrate that trade integration reduces the importance of relative market size for differences in the extent of corporate taxation between countries. Then, using a dataset of 26 OECD countries over the period 1982-2004, we provide supportive evidence of these theoretical predictions, i.e., market size differences are strongly positively correlated with corporate income tax differences across countries, but crucially, trade integration weakens this link. These findings are obtained controlling for the potential endogeneity of trade integration and are robust to alternative specifications.","[Exbrayat, Nelly] Univ St Etienne, Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-42023 St Etienne 02, France; [Geys, Benny] Norwegian Business Sch BI, N-0442 Oslo, Norway; [Geys, Benny] Vrije Univ Brussel, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; BI Norwegian Business School; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Exbrayat, N (通讯作者)，Univ St Etienne, Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, 6 Rue Basse Rives, F-42023 St Etienne 02, France.",nelly.exbrayat@univ-st-etienne.fr; Benny.Geys@bi.no,,"Exbrayat, Nelly/0000-0002-0566-504X; Geys, Benny/0000-0003-4524-1820",,,,,50,6,6,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We contrast three incentive schemes in a real-effort experiment in which individuals decide when to quit: a continuous incentive scheme and two intermittent ones, fixed and random. In all treatments, we introduce a regime shift by withdrawing monetary rewards after the same unknown number of periods. In such an ambiguous environment, we show that less able and more risk averse players are less persistent in effort. Intermittent incentives lead to a greater persistence of effort, while continuous incentives entail exit as soon as payment stops. Randomness increases both earlier and later exiting. This selection effect in terms of ability and risk attitudes combined with the impact of intermittent rewards on persistence lead to an increase in mean performance after the regime shift when incentives are intermittent.

Such reform initiated with the enactment of a Code of Best Corporate Practices and was followed by legal mandates, which required fundamental changes in the structure of corporate boards. First, we investigate the extent of compliance with both the Code and legal mandates to determine if firms changed their governance systems. Then, we examine whether positive changes in governance (if realized) are associated with better firm performance and higher valuations. Our findings indicate that compliance with the Code and the legal mandates improved markedly over time. However, such positive changes in governance are not associated with an improvement in the performance (greater ROAs) or valuations (Tobin's Q) of all firms. Firms with a lower concentration of insider ownership do exhibit some improvements in performance. We attribute these findings in large part to the inherent intricacies in the ownership structure of firms and the legal environment prevailing in Mexico. Our view is that the high concentration of insider ownership and the weak legal protection afforded to minority shareholders are major obstacles to any effective reform. Without a demonstrated commitment to make substantial changes in either, it is unlikely that there will be any discernible improvements in either corporate governance or in the investment climate in Mexico.","[Macias, Antonio J.] Univ Cristiana Tejas, Escuela Negocios Neeley, Dept Finanzas, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Roman, Francisco J.] George Mason Univ, Escuela Adm, Dept Contabilidad, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Macías, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cristiana Tejas, Escuela Negocios Neeley, Dept Finanzas, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",froman2@gmu.edu,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,17,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This paper provides a wide ranging review of the existing literature aimed at underpinning empirical tourism research with a robust economic framework. So far, tourism research has mostly focused on either quantitative or qualitative approaches that lack a strong economic theoretical setting. Most of the literature on resident's welfare analysis concentrates on their attitudes and perceptions without taking explicitly into account their preferences about policy development based on a cost-benefit assessment. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to draw connections within the current body of research to explain the relationship between residents and tourism activity, as well as consumer theory and economic choice. In this way, it is possible to construct a multidimensional framework that allows one to analyse residents' welfare in a systematic and more comprehensive manner.","[Meleddu, Marta] Univ Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Meleddu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",,"Meleddu, Marta/HFZ-7852-2022","Meleddu, Marta/0000-0003-3081-0584",,,,,117,24,24,4,90,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Given that public long-term care expenditure is high in many OECD countries, governments are increasingly concerned about its future growth. This study focuses on three relevant issues. First, we discuss factors that affect the growth of long-term expenditure and its projections. These include demographics, the balance in provision between informal and formal care, whether higher life expectancy translates into higher disability, the interrelation between health and long-term care, and whether long-term care suffers from Baumol's disease. Second, given that a significant proportion of long-term care expenditure is nursing-and care-home expenditure, we discuss the role of government regulation aimed at ensuring that individuals receive appropriate quality of care in such institutions. We focus in particular on price regulation, competition, and the non-profit sector; these have been the subject of considerable empirical work (mainly in the United States). Third, we discuss the relative merits of public and private insurance. Countries differ greatly in their approach. Some countries have nearly exclusively public insurance but in others this is small. We consider the conditions under which public insurance can overcome the limitations of a private insurance market.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, Heslington York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Siciliani, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, Heslington York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",luigi.siciliani@york.ac.uk,"siciliani, luigi/AAE-8686-2020",,,,,,96,15,15,4,66,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The modelling results show that the wholesale electricity prices indeed increase by about 90%, but the retailer prices only increase by 25%. The coal-fired electricity generators will reduce their output by 8% (for black-coal) to 18% (for brown-coal), but the profitability of the industry will drop dramatically. On the other hand, generators using oil, gas or renewable resources, will increase their output significantly and enjoy a handsome profit.

For example, transformations may correspond to the set of finite permutations, or the shift in a dynamic choice model. Our main result is that any invariant preference must be parametric: there is a unique sufficient set of parameters such that the preference ranks acts according to their expected utility given the parameters. Parameters are characterized in terms of objective frequencies, and can thus be interpreted as objective probabilities. By contrast, uncertainty about parameters is subjective. The preferences for which the above results hold are only required to be reflexive, transitive, monotone, continuous, and mixture linear. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Credit panics are self-fulfilling shocks to expected credit conditions which cause transitions from an optimal but fragile steady state to a suboptimal state with zero unsecured credit. The main findings are: (i) Countercyclical reserve policies protect the optimal equilibrium against modest shocks but are powerless against large shocks. (ii) If we ignore private information and central bank inefficiencies, this class of models bears out Bagehot's 1873 claim in Lombard Street: panics are averted if central banks stand ready to lend at a rate somewhat above the one associated with the optimal state.

And even now economists seem unable to suggest ways out of this crisis. It is widely acknowledged that the emphasis of modern economics over the last 50 years has been heavily mathematical and formalistic. The aim of this paper is to examine whether, in the wake of the crisis, academic economists have examined this emphasis on mathematics and further to investigate the extent to which they are considering changing their methodological orientation. The results of our field study show that many economists have tended to reaffirm their position and argued for the use of newer, better mathematical models in economics.","[Negru, Ioana] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England",Anglia Ruskin University,"Negru, I (通讯作者)，Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Econ, Lord Ashcroft Bldg,3rd Floor,East Rd, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England.",ioana.negru@anglia.ac.uk,"Negru, Ioana/AAQ-8027-2020; Bigo, Vinca/AAL-9101-2020",,,,,,60,5,5,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The government finances public investment by employing distortionary labor taxes. The balanced budget rule implies a negative short-run output multiplier that exceeds (in absolute terms) the positive long-run output multiplier. Larger public capital spillovers sharpen the intertemporal output tradeoff. In contrast to conventional results regarding public investment shocks, we obtain dampened cyclical responses for plausible parameter values. The cyclical dynamics arise from the interaction between the labor tax rate, the tax base, and the intergenerational spillover effects. We show that financing scenarios involving public debt creation can substantially reduce the short-run output contraction and the transitional macroeconomic fluctuations induced by public investment.

We compare optimal extraction paths and the social costs of optimal adaptation in two cases: under certainty, i.e. when the date of occurrence of the shock is known, and under uncertainty, when the date of occurrence of the shock is a random variable. We show that an increase in uncertainty leads to a decrease in precautionary behavior in the short run and to an increase in precautionary behavior in the long run. We apply our model to the particular case of the Western la Mancha aquifer in Spain.

It takes advantage of the dynamic nature of institutional reforms in transition economies and explores the causal effects of those reforms on banks' Tobin's Q over the period of 1997-2008. Using a difference-in-difference approach, the paper shows that Tobin's Q increases substantially after these countries reform their legal institutions and liberalize banking. However, it decreases after stock market reforms. After further examination of the interactive relationships between different reforms and bank valuation, it is observed that when the banking reform is well implemented, legal reform can have a stronger impact on banks' Tobin's Q. On the other hand, banking reform and security market reform has a substitutive relationship. The analysis also suggests that foreign ownership, market power, and asset diversification significantly affect Tobin's Q. These results are robust even after simultaneously controlling for equity risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, the level of interactivity in the economy as a whole will rise with the density of links in the social network and with the degree to which agents are clustered in physical space. When agents can choose geographic locations, there is a tendency for those who are more central in the social network to locate closer to the interaction center, leading to a form of endogenous geographic separation based on social distance. We also show that the market equilibrium is not optimal because of social externalities. We determine the value of the subsidy to interactions that could support the first-best allocation as an equilibrium. Finally, we interpret our model in terms of labor-market networks and show that the lack of good job contacts would be here a structural consequence of the social isolation of inner-city neighborhoods.

Using data from Romania, this study sheds light on what happens to the supplying industries after a country opens its retail sector to foreign direct investment. The study relies on a unique dataset combining outlet-specific information on global retail chains with a panel of Romanian manufacturing firms. The difference-in-difference analysis finds that the expansion of global retail chains leads to a significant increase in the total factor productivity (TFP) in the supplying manufacturing industries: their entry into a region raises the TFP by 3.8-4.7%. These results suggest that liberalizing retail sector can boost performance of domestic manufacturing.

By means of a critical analysis of (Acemoglu et al., 2012), we show that the advantage of these models, their analytical tractability, does not make up for their disadvantages, lack of control over policy implications and questionable numerical results. On the one hand, a comprehensive analysis of the results of Acemoglu et al. (2012) shows that even research subsidies do not pave the way for ambitious climate policies with low transitory costs, thus contradicting their policy message. On the other hand, critical parameters such as the elasticity of substitution between clean and dirty technologies, carbon sinks, or the productivity of researchers are not in accordance with existing scientific knowledge. We show that using more realistic parameters leads to even more pessimistic conclusions and that their model provides no leeway for overcoming them. We suggest that a too highly aggregated model can only describe an incorporeal economy and comes to a deadlock. We propose a more promising route for economic research in order to break this deadlock. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that while in the two episodes of recession and financial stress the ECB acted aggressively providing liquidity to banks, the second recession, unlike the first, has been characterized by an abnormal decline of loans with respect to both real economic activity and the monetary aggregates. It conjectures that this fact is explained by the postponement of the adjustment in the banking sector. It shows that euro area banks, over the 2008-2012 period, did not change neither the capital to asset ratio nor the size of their balance sheet relative to GDP keeping them at the pre-crisis level. The paper also describes other aspects of banks' balance sheet adjustment during the two crises pointing to a progressive dismantling of financial integration involving the inter-bank market since the first crisis and the market for government bonds since the second.

Not only could the results be applied in setting policy objectives but also unveil if low unemployment, stable prices and fast growth are supportive objectives.

VAR modeling is subject to the Lucas critique and fails to take into account the inherent nonlinearities of the economy, while it can only be utilized in the analysis of stationary series and in many cases stationarity assumptions are too restrictive. A novel time-varying multivariate state-space estimation method for vector autoregression models is introduced. For the time-varying parameter model (TVP-VAR), the parameters are estimated using a multivariate specification of the standard Kalman filter (Harvey, 1990) combined with a suitable extension of the univariate methodology framework of Kim and Nelson (1999). The TVP-VAR model as well as standard VARs and Bayesian VARs, are used in a comparative investigation of their predicting performance for the monthly IP, CPI and Euribor rate of the EU economy. The total period covers 1999:1-2011:2 with an out-of-sample testing period of 2007:2 to 2011:2, which included the US sub-prime and the EU debt crisis sub-periods. The results varied across the investigated time series and indicated that the TVP-VAR model consistently outperforms the other models in case of the EU monthly CPI, while different specifications of the VAR and BVAR models for the IP and Euribor series provide with better forecasting performance. Interestingly, the robustness analysis showed that the TVP-VAR model provided with enhanced predictability in particular during crisis times. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Adopting an optimal tax framework, we propose a method to decompose the leakage and terms-of-trade motives for emission price differentiation. We employ our method for the quantitative impact assessment of unilateral climate policy based on empirical data. We find that the leakage motive yields only small efficiency gains compared to uniform emission pricing. Likewise, the terms-of-trade motive has rather limited potential for strategic burden shifting.

The calibration procedure leads to the welfare analysis being conducted with the wrong parameters. The ability of the calibrated model to correctly predict the long-run welfare changes induced by a set of policy experiments is assessed. The results show that, for the policy reforms with sizable welfare effects (i.e., more than 0.2%), the model always predicts the right sign of the welfare effects. However, the welfare effects can be evaluated with the wrong sign, when they are small and when the sample size is fairly limited. Quantitatively, the maximum errors made in evaluating a policy change are very small for some reforms (in the order of 0.02 percentage points), but bigger for others (in the order of 0.6 percentage points). Finally, having access to better data, in terms of larger samples, does lead to substantial increases in the precision of the welfare effects estimates, though the rate of convergence can be slow.

If the liquidity trap is very prolonged, the spending multiplier can be much larger than in normal circumstances, and the budgetary costs minimal. However, given this fiscal free lunch, it is unclear why policymakers would want to limit the size of fiscal expansion. Our paper addresses this question in a model environment in which the duration of the liquidity trap is determined endogenously, and depends on the size of the fiscal stimulus. We show that even if the multiplier is high for small increases in government spending, it may decrease substantially at higher spending levels; thus, it is crucial to distinguish between the marginal and average responses of output and government debt.","[Erceg, Christopher; Linde, Jesper] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Erceg, C (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",christopher.erceg@frb.gov; jesper.l.linde@frb.gov,,,,,,,37,86,96,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Substitution estimates without accounting for rationing are misleading. In contrast, using virtual prices and estimating a free' market system yield results similar to those of the pre-war period.

Combination of each model utilizes a set of weights computed using a linear mixture of experts's framework, where weights are determined by log scores assigned to each model's predictive performance. As well as model uncertainty, we take potential structural break in the parameters of the models into consideration. In our application, to quarterly data for ten currencies (including the Euro) for the period 1990q1-2008q4, we show that the forecasts from ensemble models produce mean and interval forecasts that outperform equal weight, and to a lesser extent random walk benchmark models. The gain from combining forecasts is particularly pronounced for longer-horizon forecasts for central forecasts, but much less so for interval forecasts.

When stock prices reflect more firm-specific information there will be less stock price synchronicity. This paper traces the experience of China, an economy undergoing dramatic institutional change in the last 20 years with rich variation in experiences across provinces. We show that stock price synchronicity is lower when there is institutional development in terms of property rights protection and rule of law. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of political pluralism on synchronicity. A more pluralistic regime reduces uncertainty and opaqueness regarding government interventions and therefore increases the value of firm-specific information that reduces synchronicity.

To date, most of its characteristics require disambiguation and specification. In this paper, we will investigate the dependence of relative mobility on sampling time interval both empirically and theoretically. Using the Chinese household income data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we find that the relative mobility will initially increase with the sampling time interval and then approach a constant value. To examine this time-dependent characteristic of mobility quantitatively, we employ a money exchange model with uniform saving rate to investigate the relation between the mobility and the sampling time interval. The relation obtained from the model is similar to that of the empirical data. The convergence rate of the mobility can be described in terms of a characteristic time interval found to be solely determined by the saving rate. The higher the saving rate is, the longer the characteristic time interval is. This work can help us better understand the time-dependence of mobility. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Steady-state and short run analysis shows that external debt and foreign aid do not affect the growth rate of consumption but have level impact on consumption. Foreign aid and governance encourage the economic growth but external debt creates a burden on the economy. Both investment and saving are independent of external debt and thus the current account surplus. Foreign aid does not affect investment directly but it has a direct positive impact on the savings in the economy. Therefore, it is argued that improvements in the quality of governance will stimulate the output and consumption rapidly and it acts like a catalyst. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical research on the issue has been hampered by the failure to tackle endogeneity issues effectively. We use measures of geographical and cultural distance to donor countries as instrumental variables to uncover the causal effect of aid on tax revenue in a panel of 93 countries. The tax to GDP ratio is found to decrease following aid inflows. This reduction in tax effort is statistically and economically significant; a one SD increase in aid causes a 0.52 percentage point drop in the tax-to-GDP ratio. The results indicate that the effect is driven by unconditional grants, whereas aid given as loans induces recipient governments to improve their tax effort. Our results are robust to changes in the sample and the use of a nearest neighbour matching technique to account for nonrandom assignment of aid. Our identification strategy is sharpened by the use of a difference-in-difference estimation strategy that leverages a natural experiment in which aid flows exogenously increased for some countries following the Iranian Revolution in 1979.","Bangor Univ, Sch Business, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Thornton, J (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Sch Business, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales.",j.thornton@bangor.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,12,14,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I document that relative wages in finance began to rise in the early 1980s in almost all states, including those that deregulated before 1970 and those that deregulated in the 1990s. Consistently, after controlling for aggregate macro shocks that affected all states, there is no evidence that relative finance wages increased more following any type of deregulation.

Observing the hazard functions of various industry groups further suggests that an industry's entry/exit conditions are even more relevant to firm survival than an industry's life-cycle phase. Moreover, a firm's age seems to be of greater importance for its survival during the early stages of the industry's life cycle than in the industry's maturity. Our findings suggest that economic policy measures aimed at providing support for start-up firms will be more efficient in young industries at the formative stage of the life cycle or in entrepreneurial regime industries, and that entry conditions should be the focus of competition policies.","[Kejzar, Katja Zajc; Ponikvar, Nina] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kejzar, KZ (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",katja.zajc@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Ponikvar, Nina/0000-0003-3976-211X",,,,,26,0,1,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JAN 2,2014,26.0,1,,,,,122,136,,10.1080/14631377.2014.874659,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AB5YJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331864300008,0

The major issue in this study is that the best copulas used to model the dependence among bond returns are the Plackett and Student models. We also find a dynamic correlation between bond returns. In particular, the relationship between nominal and indexed bonds is characterized by an asymmetric dependence. Moreover, the results obtained by the copula approach are confirmed by those obtained by multivariate GARCH modelling. Our empirical study provides a useful method that may be employed by decision-makers to quantitatively introduce dependence and spillover effects in their bond issuance policy.

Further, since such countries typically have acute shortages of public capital, the finance from resource depletion is an opportunity for needed public investment. Using a new global panel dataset on public capital and resource rents covering the period 1970 to 2005 we find that, contrary to these expectations, resource rents significantly reduce the public capital stock. This is more direct evidence for a policy-based 'resource curse' than the conventional, indirect evidence from the relationships between resource endowments, growth and income. The adverse effect on public capital is mitigated by good institutions. We also find that rents from the depletion of non-renewable (mineral) resources reduce the public capital stock whereas rents from sustainable (forestry and agriculture) sources do not.","[Bhattacharyya, Sambit] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Colliery, Paul] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford,"Bhattacharyya, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",s.bhattacharyya@sussex.ac.uk,"Bhattacharyya, Sambit/F-6814-2011","Bhattacharyya, Sambit/0000-0001-5932-6943",,,,,31,68,72,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

These studies have progressively improved model specifications to control for potential sources of bias, but they often lead to conflicting results. Multilateral resistance terms (MRTs) are considered to be one of the most crucial factors to be accounted for to avoid the omitted variable bias in the gravity model. What has gone unnoticed, however, is that the control for MRTs leads to near-prefect multicollinearity because of the structural relationship between the variables that measure the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO) membership status of any country pairs. This multicollinearity contributes to the fragility of the WTO effect estimates, as it dramatically increases SEs.

We find that the combined company could take the advantage of regional market dominance in the beer market in expanding regional market shares in the soju market. Such leverage effects are differentiated from the efficiency-enhancing portfolio effects that result in the combined company's expanding shares over all regional soju markets regardless of the presence of dominance in the beer market. The common distribution channels of liquor wholesalers seem to play a pivotal role in the combined firm's expansion of dominance in one market into another. Furthermore, we implement separate empirical tests for two subsamples of regionally dominant and nondominant soju companies in order to differentiate the leverage effects of foreclosure from those of toehold. The empirical results show the evidence of leverage effects only for a sample of nondominant soju companies. This implies that the leverage effects of conglomerate mergers between beer and soju companies in Korea had pro-competitive effects in that the combined firm could compete more effectively with regionally dominant companies with the leverage of dominance in the beer market as toehold.","[Chung, Jinhwa] Keimyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Taegu, South Korea; [Jeon, Seonghoon] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Keimyung University; Sogang University,"Jeon, S (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",jeonsh@sogang.ac.kr,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although the exponential growth of Spanish unemployment is mainly caused by a lower demand for labor, there is also a second cause, viz, an increased supply of labor, reflected by higher participation rates. In this paper we investigate how participation rates are affected by business cycle fluctuations, while accounting for different labor market behaviour of men and women. Based on an analysis using Spanish quarterly data over the period 1976-2012, we find evidence for a linear discouraged worker effect for men (i.e., decreasing participation rates during recessions), implying that male participation rates will continue to show a weak but sustained decrease as long as unemployment keeps rising. On the contrary, we find a significant 'added' worker effect (i.e., increasing participation rates during recessions) for women, but only when unemployment rates are below a certain threshold. Since the Spanish unemployment rate just recently (in 2012) passed this threshold, our results suggest that the added worker effect for women no longer applies and that, accordingly, the recent increase in female participation rates now comes to an end.","[Congregado, Emilio; Golpe, Antonio A.] Univ Huelva, Dept Econ, Huelva, Spain; [Carmona, Monica] Univ Huelva, Dept Management & Mkt, Huelva, Spain; [Van Stel, Andre] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",Universidad de Huelva; Universidad de Huelva; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Congregado, E (通讯作者)，Univ Huelva, Dept Econ, Huelva, Spain.",congregado@uhu.es; monica@uhu.es; antonio.golpe@dehie.uhu.es; a.vanstel@uva.nl,"Golpe, Antonio/F-6995-2016; Carmona, Monica/K-6256-2013","Golpe, Antonio/0000-0003-0360-1541; Van Stel, Andre/0000-0003-4512-654X; Carmona, Monica/0000-0002-4122-0240",,,,,36,6,6,1,13,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The most corrupt countries are however also the poorest, and this is why they may receive more aid. This paper provides the first theoretical and empirical grounds for this rationale. The key is that corruption is not exogenous but, instead, an equilibrium phenomenon. We build a multi-country model of optimal aid in which we disentangle the correlation between aid and corruption into two components: the first reflects variations in the quality of institutions and the second variations in productivity levels. The data suggest that both components of the correlation are significant; however the effect of variations in productivity levels is stronger. Because the cross-country heterogeneity in productivity is more important than the heterogeneity in institutional quality, it is optimal to give more foreign aid to more corrupt countries.","[de la Croix, David] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [de la Croix, David] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Delavallade, Clara] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Cape Town,"de la Croix, D (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",david.delacroix@uclouvain.be; clara.delavallade@ensae.org,"de la Croix, David/E-4677-2013","de la Croix, David/0000-0002-7589-8535",,,,,23,21,24,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The results show that economic growth in South Africa is driven primarily by trade and fixed investment rather than by capital inflows. However, the relationship between economic growth and imports is bidirectional, and thus economic growth in South Africa is associated to a greater extent with the export-led growth hypothesis than the import-led growth hypothesis. In addition, the results find in favour of growth-led FDI rather than FDI-led growth, and that portfolio inflows rather than FDI are integrated into the country's trade-led growth dynamics.","[Gossel, Sean J.; Biekpe, Nicholas] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Gossel, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",gosselse@gsb.uct.ac.za,"gossel, sean/ABC-3931-2021; Biekpe, Nicholas/GNH-1675-2022; Biekpe, Prof Nicholas/AHB-9529-2022","gossel, sean/0000-0002-9156-1959; Biekpe, Nicholas/0000-0002-9702-1232",,,,,175,14,14,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We analyse data for 33 OECD countries over the period 1970-2010 and include - as far as it is statistically feasible - all macroeconomic and institutional determinants of HCE growth in the EBA that have been suggested in the literature. Furthermore, we analyse to what extent outliers in the data influence the results. Our results confirm earlier findings that GDP growth and a variable representing Baumol's cost disease' theory emerge as robust and statistically significant determinants of HCE growth. Depending on whether or not outliers are excluded, we find up to six additional robust drivers: the growth in expenditure on health administration, the change in the share of inpatient expenditure in total health expenditure, the (lagged) government share in GDP, the change in the insurance coverage ratio, the growth in land traffic fatalities and the growth in the population share undergoing renal dialysis.","[Hartwig, Jochen; Sturm, Jan-Egbert] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sturm, Jan-Egbert] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Ifo Institut,"Hartwig, J (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",hartwig@kof.ethz.ch,,"Sturm, Jan-Egbert/0000-0002-9421-5736; Hartwig, Jochen/0000-0002-8138-5920",,,,,43,38,39,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Does regulating firms based on their market shares make theoretical sense? We set up a simple duopoly model with stochastic R&D activities to evaluate market share regulation policy. On the one hand, market share regulation discourages the larger company's R&D investment and causes economic inefficiency. On the other hand, it facilitates the smaller company's survival, and prevents the larger company from monopolizing the market. We show that consumers tend to benefit from market share regulation. However, the social welfare including firms' profits would be hurt if both firms are equally good at R&D innovation. Nonetheless, if the smaller firm can make innovations more efficiently, then protecting smaller firms through market share regulation can improve the social welfare. We relate our analysis to a case study of Asahi Brewery's introducing Asahi Super Dry to become the top market share company in the industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the fact that a supervisory on institution has access to all information regarding an insurance firm under assessment, information asymmetry in the relation between a supervisory authority and an insurance company, by definition, should not take place. However, the performed research into this phenomenon indicates that some of its symptoms can be observed, which results from imperfections ingrained in the information itself, from the cognitive limitations of supervisory institutions staff (decision makers), as well as the indirect implementation, by a supervisory institution, of the information disclosed by insurance firms on a voluntary basis. The consequences of information asymmetry may become the reason for an improperly performed assessment by the supervision authority and may influence the decisions made. The performed analysis also puts an emphasis on the fact that classically described information asymmetry effects, such as adverse selection and moral hazard, in cases of asymmetry occurrence in the relations between a supervisory institution and an insurance company, should be supplemented by a costly verification of the current situation (collecting information and its credibility verification) which, depending on the scale, is significant for supervisory authorities in the process of the performed assessment and in taking due decisions, as well as for the proper allocation of the resources at the disposal of insurance institutions and also for the correct functioning of the entire insurance market. Each area of information asymmetry, in relations between a supervision institution and an insurance firm, generates a different type of protection possibilities against its occurrence, its reduced scope and for minimizing its effects, which has also been discussed in the study. Due to the fact that legal regulations and information submission arrangements are not capable of eliminating all information limitations for asymmetry occurrence to be correctly identified, it is necessary to keep monitoring all information processes taking place in relations between a supervision institution and an insurance firm. An indispensable condition for eliminating the limited capacity in recognizing insurance companies' attributes by supervision authorities, is studying the influence of all new regulations and researching the phenomena influencing the course of the supervisory processes. However, the fact that a different (larger) information scope is available for a supervisory institution does not necessarily have to influence the decisions made by this institution.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Kurek, R (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Wroclaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,4,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The confounding factor of upward accountability is ruled out by using two-step estimation, and the reverse causality between public goods provision and collective actions is controlled by using instrumental variables.

Decomposition of several effects is achieved by identifying several counterfactual distributions of different groups. These go beyond the usual Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions at the (linear) conditional means. Much like quantiles, these entropic distances are well-defined inferential objects and functions whose statistical properties have recently been developed. Going beyond these strong rankings and distances, we consider weak uniform ranking of these wage outcomes based on statistical tests for stochastic dominance. The empirical analysis is focused on employees with at least 35 hours of work in the 1996-2012 monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). Among others, we find incumbent workers enjoy a better distribution of wages, but the attribution of the gap to wage inequality and human capital characteristics varies between quantiles. For instance, highly paid new workers are mainly due to human capital components, and in some years, even better wage structure.","[Maasoumi, Esfandiar; Wu, Ke] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Pitts, Melinda] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA",Emory University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Maasoumi, E (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-9053,,978-1-78441-182-4; 978-1-78441-183-1,ADV ECONOMETRICS,,,2014,33.0,,,,,,587,612,,10.1108/S0731-905320140000033016,0.0,,,26,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360559300017,0

The fluctuations of the unemployment rate as well as its persistence in some countries impose challenges to economic policy makers. In order to implement appropriate policy measures, it is necessary to know the exact character of the unemployment in the observed country - is it structural or cyclical. In the context of economic theory, it is important to examine which concept better represents the behaviour of the unemployment rates - the concept of the natural rate of unemployment or hysteresis hypothesis. The character of unemployment is also influenced by some characteristics of a country under consideration. Therefore, the article examines the presence of hysteresis in monthly unemployment rates from January 2000 to January 2013 in two groups of countries: the selected European OECD countries and selected Central and Eastern European countries in transition. The analysis was conducted by using univariate and panel unit root tests and the structural break analysis. Although the hysteresis hypothesis cannot be rejected for the majority of the countries, when using univariate and panel unit root tests, the results of the structural break analysis indicate that the hysteresis hypothesis can be rejected in the case of OECD countries. In other words, the natural rate of unemployment better represents the movement of unemployment rates in this group of countries in the overall period. On the other hand, the hysteresis hypothesis cannot be rejected in the case of countries in transition. The presence of hysteresis effects in the countries in transition indicates that the application of economic policy directed to the demand side of the economy might have positive effects on reduction of unemployment. In OECD countries it is necessary to implement the institutional measures which could affect the bargaining power of labour unions, unemployment benefits, labour market flexibility, and so on.","[Marjanovic, Gordana; Mihajlovic, Vladimir] Univ Kragujevac, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Marjanovic, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Djure Pucara 3, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",gmarjanovic@kg.ac.rs; vmihajlovic@kg.ac.rs,"Mihajlović, Vladimir/AAD-6388-2022","Mihajlović, Vladimir/0000-0002-8298-3623; Marjanovic, Gordana/0000-0001-8933-1065",,,,,39,7,7,0,14,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Using PIAAC database, the results indicate that both years of education and skills contribute to determine wages, with higher returns to years of education as the level of skills increases. It is also found that returns to years of educational mismatch vary depending on the skills acquired by workers, with a higher premium (penalty) to years of over-(under-) education among workers with higher (lower) levels of skills. Finally, we note that educational mismatch and skills mismatch are two different phenomena in the Spanish labor market, with educational mismatch lying behind the existing wage gap between workers who hold a similar job.","[Mateos Romero, Lucia; Murillo Huertas, Ines P.; Salinas Jimenez, Ma del Mar] Univ Extremadura, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Romero, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain.",,"del Mar Salinas-Jiménez, Maria/I-9176-2018; Romero, Lucía Mateos/G-2579-2015; Salinas, Maria/JMR-2052-2023","Romero, Lucía Mateos/0000-0002-4594-2435;",,,,,37,0,0,1,24,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2014,,210,,,,,85,108,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.14.3.4,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V43ZS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000209719900004,0

Our central, paradoxical result is that a more attractive outside option, or a higher quality of donor's information may end up encouraging the local elite to propose a project that better matches their own preference rather than the preference of the grassroots. Moreover, in the case where the noise in the donor's information follows a normal distribution, we find that a better outside option generally decreases elite capture but improved information about the needs of the target population is likely to increase elite capture.

First, we show that the one-sector RBC model augmented by LBD can generate aggregate comovement in response to news shock about technology. Second, we show that in the two-sector RBC model, LBD along with an intratemporal adjustment cost can generate sectoral comovement in response to news about three types of shocks: i) neutral technology shock, ii) consumption technology shock, and iii) investment technology shock.

This is due to the fact that mining activities, directly or indirectly, have an adverse impact on environment and ecology. For this reason, the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process has been developed for evaluation of the possible impact of mine development and operations on the environment, including the natural, social and economic aspects. In this article, an EIA methodology based on analytic network process and fuzzy simple additive weight (SAW) is proposed to formulate the environmental risks pertaining to mining projects. In the system of the proposed model, the importance weights are calculated by an ANP process. Then, fuzzy SAW is employed to evaluate the preference ratings of the alternatives.

This analysis extends the concept of congressional dominance to the allocation of H1N1, or swine flu, vaccine doses. States with Democratic United States Representatives on the relevant House oversight committee received roughly 60,000 additional doses per legislator during the initial allocation period, though this political advantage dissipated after the first 3 weeks of vaccine distribution. As a result political factors played a role in determining vaccine allocation only when the vaccine was in particularly short supply. At-risk groups identified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), such as younger age groups and first responders, do not receive more vaccine doses, and in fact receive slightly fewer units of vaccine.","Duquesne Univ, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15221 USA",Duquesne University,"Ryan, ME (通讯作者)，Duquesne Univ, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15221 USA.",ryanm5@duq.edu,,,,,,,16,10,14,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

We demonstrate that if the generation sector is perfectly competitive and does not own storage, then storage cannot be welfare-diminishing. Otherwise, generator-owned storage or standalone storage in a market with strategic generating firms can reduce welfare compared to the no-storage case.

This article offers a complementary, quantitative description of the state-of-the-art of the literature based on bibliometric methods, by explicitly addressing the roots, evolution and influence of NSI literature. The exercise shows that over time the rate of published articles was quite irregular and that contributions on NSI have not (yet) converged to an integrated analytical framework. Although historically detailed descriptions on NSI showed a noticeable increase in the more recent period (20062010) analyses using more formal and diversified quantitative methodologies for assessing the performance of NSI remained lacking, reflecting its persisting methodological weaknesses. The roots of the NSI literature can be found at the core of innovation studies by certain well-known scholars in the area of economics of innovation and science policy research. Even though publications on NSI are falling in relative importance and are highly concentrated on a small set of countries (United Kingdom, Denmark, and the United States), their influence is global. They are cited by authors affiliated in organisations around the world, notably in Latin America and Asia. Such an influence goes far beyond the area of innovation studies and has resonated in fields such as economic geography, environmental studies, international business and managerial sciences. This demonstrates that the NSI literature is not self-referential.","[Teixeira, Aurora A.

Our analyses indicate that official statistics of 2012 underestimate China's urban employment by approximately 47 million while overestimating rural employment by 31 million. The adjusted urbanization rate exceeded 55 percent in 2012, almost 3 percentage points higher than the official statistics. Nevertheless, there remains much potential for rural-to-urban migration. More specifically, if the current bottlenecks in household registration, social security and public welfare systems can be removed or relaxed, China's urbanization rate could rise by another 10 percentage points or even more over the next decade.","[Wang, Xiaolu] Natl Econ Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Wang, XL (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangxiaolu@neri.org.cn; gwan@adb.org,,,,,,,10,34,36,1,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2014,22.0,1,,,,,30,44,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12051.x,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AJ0RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337364000002,0

Based on daily samples taken from August 30, 2006 to September 11, 2012, the dynamics of new energy/fossil fuel stock spillover are found to be significant and asymmetric. Compared with positive news, negative news about new energy and fossil fuel stock returns leads to larger return changes in their counter assets. News about both new energy and fossil fuel stock returns spills over into variances of their counter assets, and the volatility spillovers depend complexly on the respective signs of the return shocks of each asset. The empirical results demonstrate that new energy and fossil fuel stocks are generally viewed as competing assets, that positive news about new energy stocks could affect the attractiveness of fossil fuel stocks and that new energy stock investment is more speculative and riskier than fossil fuel stock investment. These results have potential implications for asset allocation, financial risk management and energy policymaking. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this new environment, backbone providers, ISPs, and suppliers of content have a far wider array of interconnection alternatives, both technical and financial, than they did only a short time ago. As is often the case, the introduction of new alternatives and contractual arrangements has led to calls to regulate which alternatives and arrangements are acceptable. In this paper, we explain why such regulation would be harmful, as it would (i) reduce the incentives of industry participants to minimize total costs; (ii) lead to higher access prices to end users; (iii) result in prices that do not adequately reflect costs; and (iv) create regulatory inefficiencies. We also explain why the alternative interconnection arrangements to which Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) (and their content provider clients) and ISPs generally have access already impose limits on the exercise of market power, thus obviating any need for regulation.

In particular, the model is able to detect the stop-go feature of China's economic growth, i.e., growth cycle, as well as business cycle. The empirical result suggests that most variation in China's macroeconomic performance came from business cycle. The investigation of the three components along with historical events suggests that the Chinese economy had been largely influenced by political activities up to the early 1990s. In the mid-1990s China entered a period of stable and highly growing economy, thanks to the economic reform and the successful implementation of macroeconomic policies. However, since the mid-2000s China has become more sensitive to the turbulences in international markets. In the foreseeable future, the challenge facing China is a more volatile economy with possible slowdown in the economic growth, although the growth rate would still be high compared to developed economies.

We find that the answer to both questions is yes. Using bilateral manufactured goods exports data from 28 developing countries during 1978-2005; we find that South-South PTAs have a significantly positive effect on manufactured goods exports. In contrast, no such effect is detected in the case of South-North PTAs.

Within the fiscal regimes correction of fiscal disequilibrium occurs through adjustments in public revenue. Changes in fiscal regimes, however, occur through shifts in public expenditure. UK authorities do not react to relatively small deficits but correct exceedingly large deficits relatively fast.

Do ESCOs reduce CO2 emissions? To answer this question, we develop an estimating equation, which approximates the IPAT model, from a simple model of production. We estimate a dynamic panel of 129 countries over the period 1980-2007 to show that the ESCOs effectively reduce CO2 emissions and that this effect increases over time.

Relations between Hofstede's dimensions, Schwartz cultural values, Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) and UNPD Human Development Index (HDI) were analysed by using correlations, multiple regression analysis, moderator and mediator analyses as well as path analyses. Correlation results showed that WGI, indulgence, harmony, affective and intellectual autonomy and egalitarianism were positively and power distance, embeddedness, and hierarchy negatively related to HDI. Regression analyses and moderation analyses showed that WGI moderated the relations between HDI and indulgence, embeddedness, intellectual autonomy and affective autonomy. In path models using structural equation modelling techniques, the effects of power distance and individualism on HDI were fully mediated by WGI whereas indulgence vs. restraint and long-term orientation had significant paths only to WGI. The effect of Schwarz's embeddedness dimension on HDI was partly mediated by WGI. In both models, WGI was strongly related to HDI. These results emphasize the importance of the quality of governance in socioeconomic development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Walkable shops operate in monopolistic competition within a local area, or neighbourhood. A small cost advantage for car-oriented shops can turn into a larger price advantage. High prices in walkable shops effect a regressive transfer from poorer to richer consumers, since the poorer are less likely to have cars. Internalizing environmental and social costs of urban automobile use could reduce prices and increase capacity utilization in walkable shops in more densely populated local areas. Many common combinations of planning and pricing tools fail to internalize important costs, and may actually subsidize driving to shop, but a combination of planning and the pricing (through taxation) of retail parking could effectively internalize the relevant costs.","Univ London, Dept Management, London, England",University of London,"Guy, F (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Management, London, England.",f.guy@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,5,7,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Despite consistent efforts aimed at diversification, Botswana's economy has remained heavily dependent on diamond exports, and the country's productivity remains a point of concern. The ability to apply foreign technologies to increase productivity and spur diversification is limited by the foreign exchange gap. This study uses an imported input growth model to analyse how the importation of capital goods contributes to enabling productivity growth and export diversification. With a panel of 340 manufacturing firms, the study also analyses the effects of imported capital goods on firm productivity growth and skills development. The results show that imported machines and equipment have increase manufacturing productivity after 1-2 years following the investment.

We do so in a model where the risk premium on long-term debt is, in part, endogenously determined. We find that both policies are consistent with unique equilibria, that, at the zero lower bound, announcements about the future path of the short-term rate can lower long-term interest rates through their impact both on expectations and on the risk premium and that long-term interest rate rules perform as well as, and at times better than, conventional Taylor rules.

We construct a model with moral hazard which compares the integrated system and the separated system. In the separated system, two independent agencies are in charge of taxes and government expenditure, respectively. Meanwhile, in the integrated system, one agency decides on both policies. In both systems, there is a third party which provides information on the effectiveness of government expenditure only to the budget agency and is willing to overstate in order to acquire more budget. It is shown that the separated system is better at controlling the information provider's incentive to mislead and can be superior under some parameter values in spite of its coordination problem.","Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, Seoul 130791, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Park, S (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 270 Imundong Dongdaemungu, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",swonpark@hufs.ac.kr,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,8,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Growth empirics have attempted to characterize these non-linearities with regression trees, additively separable non-parametric estimates, or simple interaction terms. Each method requires specific assumptions about functional form which we demonstrate may not be defensible. We provide two alternate mechanisms for making inference about the growth effects of production-function shifters that do not make a priori assumptions about functional form: monotonicity tests and average derivative estimation. Our results suggest that the growth effects of policies are country-specific while the effects of institutions are more robustly monotonic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It shows that R&D policy can vary depending on the regulator's objective: social welfare, consumer surplus or producer surplus; however, the outcomes are invariant to the nature of market competition. Undoubtedly, the relative-performance contract plays a crucial role for elaborating policy effects. The government prefers discriminatory R&D policy to uniform policy under a consumer-oriented objective. On the contrary, under a producer-oriented objective, the government would prefer to choose uniform R&D policy rather than discriminatory policy.","Kun Shan Univ, Dept Finance & Banking, Tainan 71003, Taiwan",Kun Shan University,"Wang, YC (通讯作者)，Kun Shan Univ, Dept Finance & Banking, 949 Da Wan Rd, Tainan 71003, Taiwan.",wyc@mail.ksu.edu.tw,,,,,,,25,1,1,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We test for both short- and the long-run efficiency using, in addition to linear cointegration models, nonlinear cointegration and error-correction models (ECMs) which allow the efficiency intensity to change per regime. Our findings can be summarized as follows: i) futures prices are found to be cointegrated with spot prices, but they do not constitute unbiased predictors of future spot prices; ii) the hypothesis of risk neutrality is rejected; iii) the short-run efficiency hypothesis is rejected, suggesting that using past futures price returns improves the modeling and forecasting of future spot prices; and iv) the nonlinear modeling suggests the presence of two distinct regimes wherein the first regime the efficiency hypothesis is supported, whereas in the second it is rejected.

Among the assumptions this entails is that the policy or project is small, so the underlying growth rate of the economy does not change. However, this assumption may be inappropriate in some important circumstances, including in climate-change and energy policy. One example is global targets for carbon emissions, while another is a large renewable energy project in a small economy, such as a hydropower dam. This paper develops some theory on the evaluation of non-marginal projects, with empirical applications to climate change and energy. We examine the conditions under which evaluation of a non-marginal project using marginal methods may be wrong, and in our empirical examples we show that both qualitative and large quantitative errors are plausible.

We show that ignoring these supply side restrictions leads to an inconsistent estimator of household preferences. We estimate the parameters of the model based on a unique panel data set of low-income households in Pittsburgh. We find that public housing is an attractive option for seniors and exceedingly poor households headed by single mothers. We also find that for each family that leaves public housing there are, on average, 3.8 families that would like to move into the vacated unit. Simple logit demand models that ignore supply side restrictions cannot generate reasonable wait times and wait lists. Demolitions of existing units increase the degree of rationing and potentially result in welfare losses. An unintended consequence of demolitions is that they increase racial segregation in low-income housing communities.","[Geyer, Judy] ABT Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sieg, Holger] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sieg, Holger] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",ABT Associates; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Geyer, J (通讯作者)，ABT Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",judy_geyer@abtassoc.com; holgers@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,43,18,22,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Evidence from China,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Junior high school students; Randomized controlled trial; Information; Counseling; Dropout,,"Recent studies have shown that only about two-thirds of the students from poor, rural areas in China finish junior high school and enter high school. One factor that may be behind the low rates of high school attendance is that students may be misinformed about the returns to schooling or lack career planning skills. We therefore conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a sample of 131 junior high schools and more than 12,000 students to test the effects of providing information on returns or career planning skills on student dropout, academic achievement and plans to go to high school. Contrary to previous studies, we find that information does not have significant effects on student outcomes. Unlike information, counseling does have an effect. However, the effect is somewhat surprising. Our findings suggest that counseling increases dropouts and seems to lower academic achievement. In our analysis of the causal chain, we conclude that financial constraints and the poor quality of education in junior high schools in poor, rural areas (the venue of the study) may be contributing to the absence of positive impacts on student outcomes from information and counseling. The negative effects of counseling on dropout may also be due to the high and growing wages for unskilled labor (high opportunity costs) in China's transitioning economy. It is possible that when our counseling curriculum informed the students about the reality of how difficult were the requirements for entering academic high school, it may have induced them to revise their benefit-cost calculations and come to the realization that they are better off dropping out and/or working less hard in school.

Most striking is the development divide that separates the newer members (the Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Vietnam countries) from the original ones (ASEAN-6). More rapid growth in the CLV since the 1990s, driven by trade, investment, and other market reforms, has reduced these income differences. While the development divide has narrowed, huge gaps remain. Further narrowing of these gaps will require an increase in the speed and the breadth of policy reforms. A gaping hole in the policy landscape in ASEAN is the failure to address labour mobility adequately. Ongoing demographic transitions will result in greater labour outflow. The current policy void on labour migration not only limits the benefits from trade and investment liberalisation but also increases the cost of structural adjustment. Although rapid growth has resulted in convergence between countries, it has increased polarisation within countries. This can threaten social cohesion, as well as the sustainability of future growth. In order to make growth more inclusive, there is a need to invest more in education and health and to institute land reform. Apart from directly reducing social and asset inequities, such policies will produce a workforce more able to participate in the growth process and adapt to structural change.","Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Menon, J (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines.",jmenon@adb.org,,,,,,,41,5,6,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

We examine volatility transmission mechanisms using high-frequency data of the stock index futures on S&P 500, Nikkei 225, FTSE 100 and the futures on the West Texas Intermediate crude oil during the period from September 2002 to September 2012. Considering the full sample, the short-term volatility of the equity futures contains information about future oil volatility incremental to the information inherent in the time series of oil volatility. On the other hand, weekly and monthly volatilities do not exhibit a significant spillover effect. Breaking the whole sample into three subsamples, no significant Granger causalities are observed in the pre-crisis period while in the crisis time and its aftermath, we document that the US and UK equity market volatilities to Granger cause the oil futures volatility which itself leads the Japanese market. In terms of magnitude, we observe an increase in the short-term volatility spillover over time. Studying the residuals of the HAR transmission models within a CCC/DCC-GARCH framework reveals increasing instantaneous correlation between the energy and equity volatilities in the course of time.

The focus on workers rather than industries as the unit of analysis allows me to examine previously unobserved economic outcomes such as nonemployment and long-run earnings losses from job transitions, both of which are critical to understanding the reallocative costs associated with these policies. Using plant-level panel variation induced by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), I find that the reallocative costs of environmental policy are significant. Workers in newly regulated plants experienced, in aggregate, more than $5.4 billion in forgone earnings for the years after the change in policy. Most of these costs are driven by nonemployment and lower earnings in future employment, highlighting the importance of longitudinal data for characterizing the costs and consequences of labor market adjustment. Relative to the estimated benefits of the 1990 CAAA, these one-time transitional costs are small.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Walker, WR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,59,165,194,8,90,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

In this paper, we address this limitation using a structural VAR analysis. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: First, the magnitude, duration, and even direction of response by stock market in a country to oil price shocks highly depend on whether the country is a net importer or exporter in the world oil market, and whether changes in oil price are driven by supply or aggregate demand. Second, the relative contribution of each type of oil price shocks depends on the level of importance of oil to national economy, as well as the net position in oil market and the driving forces of oil price changes. Third, the effects of aggregate demand uncertainty on stock markets in oil-exporting countries are much stronger and more persistent than in oil-importing countries. Finally, positive aggregate and precautionary demand shocks are shown to result in a higher degree of co-movement among the stock markets in oil-exporting countries, but not among those in oil-importing countries.

We set up and compute a heterogeneous-agent neoclassical growth model, where households value government purchases which are financed by income taxes. A key feature of the model is a wealth bias in the political aggregation process. When calibrated to U.S. wealth inequality and exposed to aggregate productivity shocks, such a model is able to generate weaker positive comovement of government purchases than models with no political wealth bias. The wealth bias that matches the cross-sectional campaign contribution distribution by income is consistent with the mild positive comovement of government purchases in the aggregate data. We thus provide an empirically relevant example where economic and political heterogeneity matter for aggregate dynamics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We highlight three key conclusions: (i) an estimate of the SCC is conditional on a specific policy scenario, the details of which must be made explicit for the estimate to be meaningful; (ii) the social discount rate relevant to intertemporal allocation decisions also depends on the policy scenario; and (iii) the SCC is uniquely defined only for policy scenarios that lead to an efficient growth path because marginal costs and benefits of emission mitigation diverge on inefficient growth paths. We illustrate these analytical conclusions with simulations of a growth model calibrated to the world economy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These games allow for effective computational modeling of mental function because they typically come equipped with notions of optimal play, which provide quantitatively prescribed target functions that can be tracked throughout an experiment. The combination of these games, computational models, and neuroimaging tools open up the possibility for new ways to characterize normal cognition and associated brain function. We propose that these tools may also be used to characterize mental dysfunction, such as that found in a range of psychiatric illnesses. We describe early efforts using a multi-round trust game to probe brain responses associated with healthy social exchange and review how this game has provided a novel and useful characterization of autism spectrum disorder. Lastly, we use the multi-round trust game as an example to discuss how these kinds of games could produce novel bases for representing healthy behavior and brain function and thus provide objectively identifiable subtypes within a broad spectrum of mental function.

Using data on alumni contributions to a university, we assess whether the correlation is due to habit formationtrue state dependenceor to unobservable factors such as affinity to the school. We further examine whether habits form by the mere act of giving or based on the amount given. We implement an instrumental variables approach using the fact that performance of the school's athletic teams and solicitation by one's former roommates generate shocks to giving while young that are plausibly uncorrelated with giving when older.

We examine investment choices under an inflexible (traditional) emissions rate performance standard for new sources. We compare the inflexible standard with a flexible one that imposes an alternative compliance payment (surcharge) for emissions in excess of the standard. A third policy allows the surcharge revenue to fund later retrofits. Analytical results indicate that increasing flexibility leads to earlier introduction of new technology, lower aggregate emissions and higher profits. We test this using multi-stage stochastic optimization for introduction of carbon capture and storage, with uncertain future natural gas and emissions allowance prices. Under perfect foresight, the analytical predictions hold. With uncertainty these predictions hold most often, but we find exceptions.

We focus on two classes of games: (1) aggregative games with strategic substitutes and (2) nice aggregative games, where payoff functions are continuous and concave in own strategies.

Might mothers be more solicitous toward offspring than fathers, for example? The economics literature has documented gender differences-children benefit more from money put in the hands of mothers rather than fathers, for example-and these differences are thought to be partly due to preferences. Yet for good reason family economics is mostly concerned with how prices and incomes affect behavior against a backdrop of exogenous preferences. Evolutionary biology complements this approach by treating preferences as the outcome of natural selection. We mine the well-developed biological literature to make a prima facie case for evolutionary roots of parental preferences. We consider the most rudimentary of traits-sex differences in gamete size and internal fertilization-and explain how they have been thought to generate male-female differences in altruism toward children and other preferences related to family behavior. The evolutionary approach to the family illuminates connections between issues typically thought distinct in family economics, such as parental care and marriage markets.","[Alger, Ingela] Univ Toulouse 1, IDEI, IAST, TSE,LERNA,CNRS, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Cox, Donald] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Boston College,"Cox, D (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",ingela.alger@tse-fr.eu; donald.cox@bc.edu,,"Alger, Ingela/0000-0003-2436-512X",NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD045637] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,99,20,24,0,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Our investigation shows that the relative size of the service sector and the ratio of female to male labor force participation are key determinants of differences in employment elasticities by gender, creating higher elasticities for women than men. We also find that the terms of global integration, as measured by the current account balance, growth in the terms of trade, and the share of foreign direct investment in investment, are important for both female and male employment elasticities.

The econometrics hinges on a model built upon Experience Weighted Attraction learning, and the simultaneous analysis of data on the information gathered and on actions taken by the subjects. Results suggest that learning is a composite process, in which different components coexist. Adaptive learning emerges as the leading element, but when subjects look at the strategies individually adopted by their competitors they tend to imitate the most successful behavior, which makes markets more competitive. Reinforcement learning also plays a role, as subjects favor strategies that have yielded higher profits in the past. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We critique and investigate the popular structure that simply assumes that workers with different age, experience or education are perfectly substitutable in production. This structure is inconsistent with empirical evidence of production complementarities. We couch our findings in the context of two types of policy reforms: a social security reform and a tax reform.

Empirical work on this link has been limited. We address the paucity of empirical evidence with a novel plant-level dataset for the cement industry during the Great Depression. We find that multi-market contact fosters tacit collusion and higher prices based on a new measure of contact that accounts for capacity utilization. A one standard deviation increase in our measure of contact increases prices by around 43%. We then examine the effect of the National Industrial Recovery Act's Codes of Fair Conduct, introduced in 1933 to stem deflation through cooperative behavior within industries. We find that the effects of the codes were most strongly felt in markets with the highest level of multi-market contact. This suggests that multi-market contact can be a useful 'tool' for firms to support collusive outcomes, tacit or otherwise. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Since only one of the subjects makes a decision, the frame can affect behavior merely through preferences. In all the experiments, we find that behavior is insensitive to social framing.

Still, even when lying is aversive, can hiring someone to lie for you allow a person to avoid the disutility from lying, while at the same time ensuring higher payoffs? The current article investigates this empirical question - the possibility of delegated deception - through a laboratory experiment. The results indicate that a significant fraction of people employ an agent (to lie) even when they could lie themselves. Moreover, the likelihood of delegating to an agent depends on the incentives, with more people choosing to delegate when the lie hurts to a greater extent the person being lied to. Finally, analysis of gender differences in the tendency to use an agent revealed that that women are more likely to delegate to an agent compared to men, especially so when the harm inflicted by the lie is larger.

With the major focus on supply side this study uses the ARDL econometric approach using annual data from the period 1971 to 2010 for Pakistan. The empirical results indicate that the foreign liabilities, domestic deposits, economic growth, exchange rate, and the monetary conditions are significantly associated with bank credit to the private sector in Pakistan, particularly in the long run. Whereas the inflation and money market rate does not affect the private credit. Moreover, in the short run the domestic deposit does not influence private credit. The results also infer that the financial health and liquidity of the banks play a significant and vital role in the determination of loan. Results also indicate that the long run relationship is stable and any disequilibrium formed in the short run will be temporary and get corrected over a period of time with a high speed of 53.5% per year.

Different from the previous literature, the paper considers technology as an endogenous variable in the process of organizational design. On this basis, the paper argues that the diffusion of digital technology is a necessary but not sufficient condition to explain the emergence of peer production. A similarly important role has been played by the set of ethics that motivated the early adherents to the free software movement. Such an ethics indeed operated as a 'cultural subsidy' that helped to overcome the complementarities existing among distinct institutional domains, and let a new organizational species to emerge.","[Landini, Fabio] MEDAlics, Milan, Italy; [Landini, Fabio] Bocconi Univ, CRIOS, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Landini, F (通讯作者)，MEDAlics, Milan, Italy.",fabio.landini@medalics.org,,"Landini, Fabio/0000-0001-7523-458X",,,,,41,6,7,2,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The basic finding is that evidence for short-term comovement between the Korean and Chinese stock markets appears to be strong, while evidence for long-term relationship is rather weak. Empirical results from subsamples suggest that both the long-term and short-term relationships have strengthened since the acquisition of QFII qualification by Korean financial firms.

Because the bottom 99% and top 1% in the U.S. and Canada have had very different rates of growth of market income since the 1980s, consumption and savings flows have necessarily changed. If aggregate expenditure is to equal aggregate income, the added savings of the increasingly affluent must be loaned to balance total current expenditure but increasing indebtedness implies financial fragility, periodic financial crises, greater volatility of aggregate income and, as governments respond to mass unemployment with counter-cyclical fiscal policies, a compounding instability of public finances. In Canada and the United States, increasing economic instability is thus an implication of increasing inequality. Either an acceleration of the income growth rate of the bottom 99%, or a decline in income growth of the top 1%, could equalize income growth rates, and thereby stabilize market income shares and macro-economic flows. However, there is no evidence that purely economic forces will produce either outcome anytime soon in Canada or the U.S. any return to stability depends on political economy. The establishment of social transfer programs, rural out-migration, expansion of school enrolment, increased female employment and declining birth rates are large one-time social changes with big income impacts for working families. In Canada and the U.S. such trends helped stabilize inequality from 1940 to 1975, while in Mexico they have reduced inequality (albeit from a high level) in recent years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It provides a distinctive and yet complementary perspective on the predictability of real estate spot return and spot volatility based on the information from the spot market alone. The results show that for the EPRA/NAREIT Europe index, the spot market tends to lead its futures market in the long run during the sample period, which can be attributed to a rather illiquid real estate futures market in sharp contrast with a voluminous spot market. Furthermore, we find the V-shaped asymmetric effect of the basis on the futures market volatility, which represents the primary channel of strong volatility transmission between securitized real estate spot and futures markets during the whole sample and the post-crisis period. This sheds light on the hedging effectiveness for the REIT index. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Previous work by Sarkar (J Econ Dyn Control 28(2):377-396, 2003), that focuses on irreversible entry decisions, showed that mean reversion has three effects on investment: (a) the variance effect (mean reversion reduces the long-run uncertainty and thus brings closer the critical investment level), (b) the realized price effect (the lower variance resulting from mean reversion makes it less likely to reach extreme high or low price levels, thereby reducing the likelihood of reaching the investment trigger) and (c) the risk discounting effect (mean reversion lowers the required rate of return, which affects both the project value and the value of the real option to invest). Metcalf and Hassett (J Econ Dyn Control 19(8):1471-1488, 1995) and Sarkar (J Econ Dyn Control 28(2):377-396, 2003) showed that (a) and (b) work in opposite directions, essentially canceling each other out, however the effect of (c) depends on parameter values, making the overall effect (a-c) of mean reversion on entry decisions ambiguous and parameter-dependent. In this paper, we show that as far as irreversible exit decisions are concerned, the effect of mean reversion is negative: Mean reversion unambiguously lowers the rate of irreversible disinvestment/exit for reasonable parameter values, since the mean reversion in this case only affects the value of the real option to exit and not the value resulting from (real) option exercise.","AUEB, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Tsekrekos, AE (通讯作者)，AUEB, Dept Accounting & Finance, 76 Patis Str, Athens 10434, Greece.",tsekrekos@aueb.gr,"Tsekrekos, Andrianos/AAI-7707-2021","Tsekrekos, Andrianos/0000-0002-9927-9907",,,,,37,1,1,1,13,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

A recent literature uses analysts' forecasts, investor surveys or present-value relationships and finds estimates of expected returns that are sometimes much lower than historical averages. This study extends the present-value approach to a dynamic optimizing framework. Given a model that captures this relationship, one can use data on dividends, earnings and valuations to infer the model-implied expected return. Using this method, the estimated expected real return to equity ranges from 4.9% to 5.6%. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that expected returns have declined by about 3 percentage points over the past 40 years.

The results show that indirect emissions are considerably larger than direct emissions due to households in urban and rural areas. Indirect urban emissions increase significantly because of growing expenditures, but indirect rural emissions do not register the same increase. Direct urban emissions decrease significantly because of changes in the energy mix, but direct rural emissions show only a slight decrease. The increase in the disparity of indirect urban-rural emissions and the decrease in the disparity in direct urban-rural emissions are evident.

An illustrative model rationalizes the relationship between trust and volatility. In this model, trust relaxes credit constraints and diminishes investment's procyclicality. I provide empirical evidence for the basic predictions of the model. Then, I show that higher trust is associated with lower macroeconomic volatility in a cross section of countries. This relationship persists when various covariates are taken into account. I use inherited trust of Americans as an instrumental variable for trust in their origin country to overcome reverse causality concerns. Using changes in inherited trust over the 20th century, I do not find clear evidence that increasing trust is also associated with decreasing volatility across time at the country level.

On the basis of plausible assumptions, accounting for unrecorded assets turns the eurozone, officially the world's second largest net debtor, into a net creditor. It also reduces the U.S. net debt significantly. The results shed new light on global imbalances and challenge the widespread view that after a decade of poor-to-rich capital flows, external assets are now in poor countries and debts in rich countries.

Companies use prediction markets to forecast sales, release dates, and other internal activities. Recently, several well-known economists have argued that government ought to eliminate impediments to unleashing the power of prediction markets broadly. This survey paper looks at the laboratory experiments which provide part of the scientific justification for using prediction markets. These systems work because people who have private knowledge can use this insider information in the market, but doing so causes the price to reflect these data. Starting with early experiments that show markets can, under certain circumstances, aggregate information, we discuss the robustness of prediction markets to various design features. We also discuss places where performance does not match rhetoric and briefly look at experimental comparisons of alternative information aggregating institutions. Another issue consistently raised regarding the implementation of prediction markets is the degree to which traders can manipulate prices and thus the information gleaned. By following a series of experiments on manipulation, we present the circumstances that are and are not sufficient for manipulation attempts to be successful. Finally, we offer suggestions on where we believe future experiments are needed in this area.","[Deck, Cary] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Deck, Cary; Porter, David] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Deck, C (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",,"Porter, David/R-7202-2019",,,,,,52,13,13,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The evolution of strategic behavior is modeled as a learning process driven by a genetic algorithm. We find that, as the size of the market grows, allocative inefficiency tends to zero and performance converges to the competitive outcome, regardless of the order-clearing rule. The main result concerns the evolution of strategic behavior as the size of the market gets larger. Under simultaneous order-clearing, only marginal traders learn to be price takers and make offers equal to their valuations/costs. Under asynchronous order-clearing, all intramarginal traders learn to be price makers and make offers equal to the competitive equilibrium price.

As a result, classical confidence sets and Bayesian credible sets will not coincide even asymptotically, and the mean, mode, or median of the posterior distribution of the structural parameters can no longer be viewed as a consistent estimator. We propose two methods of constructing confidence intervals for structural model parameters that are asymptotically valid from a frequentist point of view regardless of the strength of identification. One involves inverting a likelihood ratio test statistic, whereas the other involves inverting a Bayes factor statistic. A simulation study shows that both methods have more accurate coverage than alternative methods of inference. An empirical study of the degree of wage and price rigidities in the U.S. economy illustrates that the data may contain useful information about structural model parameters even when these parameters are only weakly identified.","[Guerron-Quintana, Pablo] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Inoue, Atsushi] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; North Carolina State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Guerron-Quintana, P (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA.",pguerron@gmail.com; atsushi@ncsu.edu; lkilian@umich.edu,,,,,,,43,22,28,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We apply the Enders and Siklos (2001) M-TAR methodology modified, for application in a multivariate framework, following Stevans (2004); unlike this author, both financial and real estate wealth are included. The results show that there is a consumption wealth effect and that the consumption discrepancies resulting from an unanticipated positive change in real estate wealth are eliminated whereas those resulting from a negative change are not; however, when the changes in the UK households financial wealth are considered, we find that consumption responds only to negative unanticipated changes in such a wealth.

We then adopt both tests to examine the SD relationships between stock indices and their corresponding index futures for 10 countries. The sample contains data from 6 developed countries and 4 developing countries. The study proposes that there should be no SD relationship between spot and futures markets in developed financial markets in which arbitrage opportunities (both pure and quasi) are rare and short-lived. However, we expect that SD relationships could be found in emerging financial markets that have more impediments to arbitrage. Consistent with this conjecture, our study finds that there are no SD relationships between spot and futures markets in the mature market sample, implying that these markets could be efficient. However, for the emerging markets, spot dominates futures for risk averters, while futures dominate spot for risk seekers in the second- and third-order SD. These results indicate that there are potential gains in expected utilities for risk averters (seekers) if they switch their investment from futures (spot) to spot (futures) in the emerging markets.

We show that, when replacing unanimity by unanimity for the grand coalition and translation covariance, these axioms characterize the Nash solution on the class of n-person choice problems with reference points. A classical bargaining problem consists of a convex feasible set that contains the disagreement point here called reference point. The feasible set of a choice problem does not necessarily contain the reference point and may not be convex. However, we assume that it satisfies some standard properties. Our result is robust so that the characterization is still valid for many subclasses of choice problems, among those is the class of classical bargaining problems.

The model applies to the short term and only to the real side. Key features are demand-driven output determination, pro-cyclical aggregate labour productivity, imperfect competition in product markets and simple bargaining in non-clearing labour markets, which together determine the functional distribution of income. Trade is modelled in a bilateral import matrix; particular attention is paid to international adjustment. Simulation results suggest that early exit from fiscal support threatens a fragile recovery. Further, domestic demand expansion and revaluation in real terms in surplus countries are necessary for rebalancing, and a variety of measures can be employed to achieve these goals.","[von Arnim, Rudiger; Bannister, Steve] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Perry, Nathan] Colorado Mesa Univ, Grand Junction, CO USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"von Arnim, R (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, 260 Cent Campus Dr,OSH 339, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",rudiger.vonarnim@economics.utah.edu,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Should the village leadership or a government agency above the village finance and/or manage the construction of the infrastructure project? To answer this question, we surveyed all rural road projects in 101 villages in rural China between 2003 and 2007 and measured the quality and per kilometer cost of each road. According to our analysis, road quality was higher when more of the project funds came from the government agency above. Moreover, projects had lower cost per kilometer when the village leaders managed the road construction.

The focus here will be on circuitism, concentrating on finance for production and on the financial instability hypothesis put forward by Minsky. In the second and third sections of the paper I give a general picture of the 'monetary circuit'. In the fourth section I discuss the old circuit theory of money of Wicksell, Schumpeter and Keynes (the Keynes before the General Theory). In the fifth section I make some comments on the Mises-Hayek line, also grounded in Wicksell's circuitism. In the sixth section I present an alternative path to the circuit and Keynesian-like conclusions, the path leading from Marx to Luxemburg to Kalecki: here the debate on finance underlines the presence of a radical problem of effective demand. In the seventh section I introduce Minsky's 'financial Keynesianism', where finance is related to investment demand and financial instability. I see Minsky as complementary rather than opposed to the circuitist line of thought. I argue in the conclusions that these traditions are relevant to understanding the recurring changes in capitalism and the current crisis. Indeed, the term 'financial Keynesianism' has taken a more concrete meaning, converging with what some authors prefer to define as 'privatized Keynesianinsm'. In my view, some of Minsky's - and also Parguez's - views about economic policy are not only in accord, they also provide a way out from the blind alley of mainstreams and the limits of Keynesianism.","Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Bellofiore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.",,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,10,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In phase 1, China accumulates and sterilizes US assets (and finances US consumption) as it pegs the renminbi to the dollar at an undervalued level, thus stimulating the domestic production of tradables, compressing domestic consumption and facilitating the transition of surplus labor into the modern sectors of the economy. In phase 2, we analyze possible future scenarios. In Scenario A, the Chinese fiscal policy is effective in partially substituting exports by shifting the domestic demand toward tradables. Scenario B emphasizes the risks for China of abandoning too early the pegging. Scenario C shows that the Chinese continuation of an export-led growth strategy is economically feasible.

In this study we estimate the impact of the complete reform of the public transport system in Santiago, Chile, named Transantiago, on a specific aspect of interest: particulate matter air pollution levels in the city. Using a regression model with daily panel data from air quality monitoring stations, we conclude that Transantiago reduced the daily average MP10 concentration levels in at least 3.9 mu g/m(3). This generates health benefits estimated to be close to US$ 200 million a year in our medium scenario, 12% of which correspond to lower public sector health expenditure. If the data for the first year of operation of the system (when it was not yet in steady-state) are excluded the estimated reduction in MP10 levels is even higher Other effects of Transantiago, positive as well as negative, would need to be estimated in order to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the reform.","[Figueroa, Eugenio; Gomez-Lobo, Andres; Jorquera, Pablo; Labrin, Felipe] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago 833015, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Figueroa, E (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Oficina 1501, Santiago 833015, Chile.",efiguero@econ.uchile.cl; agomezlo@econ.uchile.cl; pjorquer@fen.uchile.cl; flabrino@fen.uchile.cl,,,,,,,23,6,6,0,21,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

Veblen's emphasis on the directive to take culture into account occurs later in Antonio Gramsci's theoretical innovations: namely, class struggle for cultural hegemony and the importance of the organic intellectual as ferment for class emergence. Gramsci was experiencing the mass movement of fascism, and the (now) classic analysis of social classes became an urgently needed extension to explain class evolution. Today, capitalism is in deep crisis once again. This paper argues that the drivers of the next revolutionary upheaval will, once more, be the social classes - particularly, the newly emerging ones.

It follows that distribution, capacity utilization, and growth vary with the real exchange rate depending on the source of change in the latter. Meanwhile, the nominal exchange rate (markup) varies whenever the real exchange rate differs from the level preferred by the government (capitalists). While there is a medium-run equilibrium when capitalists and the government share a preferred real exchange rate, convergence to it is not ensured. Indeed, when the government is primarily concerned with preserving workers' share in income when managing the nominal exchange rate, a limit cycle arises: the economy goes through endogenous cyclical fluctuations in real exchange rate and growth that resemble the experience of several developing countries. Hence, growth regressions featuring the real exchange rate have to properly take into account the codetermination of the real exchange rate and the functional distribution of income.","[Lima, Gilberto Tadeu] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Porcile, Gabriel] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Div Prod Prod & Management, Santiago, Chile; [Porcile, Gabriel] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Econ, BR-80060000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Lima, Gilberto Tadeu] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal do Parana; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Lima, GT (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,"Lima, Gilberto Tadeu/E-2731-2013","Lima, Gilberto Tadeu/0000-0002-0307-8298",,,,,18,20,24,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Then, one day, this egalitarian utopia is disturbed by an entrepreneur with an idea for a new product. Think of the entrepreneur as Steve Jobs as he develops the iPod, J. K. Rowling as she writes her Harry Potter books, or Steven Spielberg as he directs his blockbuster movies. The new product makes the entrepreneur much richer than everyone else. How should the entrepreneurial disturbance in this formerly egalitarian outcome alter public policy? Should public policy remain the same, because the situation was initially acceptable and the entrepreneur improved it for everyone? Or should government policymakers deplore the resulting inequality and use their powers to tax and transfer to spread the gains more equally? In my view, this thought experiment captures, in an extreme and stylized way, what has happened to US society over the past several decades. Since the 1970s, average incomes have grown, but the growth has not been uniform across the income distribution. The incomes at the top, especially in the top 1 percent, have grown much faster than average. These high earners have made significant economic contributions, but they have also reaped large gains.

The production technology is Cobb-Douglas with externalities generated by factor inputs. We establish that, with a general utility function, the well-known Benhabib-Farmer condition (Benhabib and Farmer, 1994) - that the labor-demand curve is upward-sloping and steeper than the Frisch labor-supply curve - is necessary for joint indeterminacy and E-stability. Then, with a separable utility function and allowing for negative externalities from capital inputs, we discover large regions in parameter space corresponding to stable indeterminacy, that is, learnable sunspot equilibria.

The bias is consistently greater in the Derby game, suggesting that the market mechanism is superior to the non-market mechanism.

The 1994 reform severely restricted temporary contracts and the 1997 reform introduced a new permanent contract figure with lower payroll taxes and dismissal costs than the ordinary. To evaluate these non-targeted treatments I present an estimation procedure that uses pre-treatment outcomes to predict the one that would have been otherwise observed in the post-treatment period in the absence of the treatment and I derive its large sample properties. Using data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey I find that both reforms failed at reducing the share of temporary employment because they had no impact on contract conversions, which account for most new permanent contracts. The 1997 reform succeed in increasing permanent hirings for some groups of workers. My findings suggest that Spanish employers took advantage of wage and dismissal cost reductions to substitute permanent contracts for otherwise temporary ones.","Dept Appl Econ, Murcia 30100, Spain",University of Murcia,"Mendez, I (通讯作者)，Dept Appl Econ, Campus Espinardo S-N, Murcia 30100, Spain.",ildefonso.mendez@um.es,,"Mendez, Ildefonso/0000-0002-2638-5071",,,,,24,3,3,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Suppliers can offer and produce the good in either of two possible specifications, both of which are equally good for the buyer. Production costs are interdependent and unknown at the time of bidding. Each supplier receives two signals about production cost, one per specification. Our model is a special case of the interdependent value settings with multidimensional types in Jehiel and Moldovanu (Econometrica 69:1237-1259, 2001) where an efficient and incentive compatible mechanism exists. We characterize equilibrium bidding behavior if the winning supplier is selected purely on the basis of price, regardless of the specification offered. While there is a positive chance of obtaining an inefficient specification, this procurement mechanism involves lower information rents than efficient mechanisms, suggesting that there is a trade-off between minimizing expected expenditure for the good, and ensuring that the efficient specification is chosen.","Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Postl, P (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",p.postl@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Alternatives do not need to be created from nothing, because the crisis itself has stimulated the emergence of ethically sound finance practices from within the sector. This article presents two cases of such alternatives, which can be understood as caring finance. Caring finance is built around more personal relationships, responsibility, and risk reduction. The examples are from the Netherlands and concern capital financing in a large, international cooperative bank and crowd funding for an organic farm respectively.

It has been recognised that a reduced division of labour can have the advantages of job enrichment and lower coordination costs. In this paper it is shown how advantages from a lesser division of labour can stem from the flow of work between different sets of resources where the work rates of individual production stages are subject to uncertainties. Both process- and project-based work are considered. Implications for the boundaries of the firm and for innovation processes are noted.

It is therefore important to discern its determinants. We contribute to the literature by investigating whether the degree to which economic institutions and policies are market-oriented is related to different measures of tolerance. Cross-sectional and first-difference regression analysis of up to 69 countries reveals that economic freedom is positively related to tolerance towards homosexuals, especially in the longer run, while tolerance towards people of a different race and a willingness to teach kids tolerance are not strongly affected by how free markets are. Stable monetary policy and outcomes is the area of economic freedom most consistently associated with greater tolerance, but the quality of the legal system seems to matter as well.

The paper analyzes the more general case that marginal costs are non-decreasing. I show that increasing marginal costs diminish the strategic substitutability between firms' quantities, i.e. firms react less to quantity changes of opponents, and that this prevents convergence to social efficiency. Thus, increasing marginal costs have a competition-reducing effect in forward trading, and this effect is so strong that equilibrium prices may even increase after cost reductions when the cost curvature increases simultaneously. This also shows that competition by forward trading differs qualitatively from both Cournot and Bertrand competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate two types of finance imperfection: a) the high down payment ratio required by central bank, and b) the unsmooth home equity withdrawal due to the prohibitive nature of refinancing. Without access to home equity withdrawal, households have to hold a considerable amount of non-housing asset such as deposit, cash, and bond as it is difficult for them to insure against negative income shocks and retirement via housing asset. This helps to account for the rising household saving rate during the past 10 years in China where commercialized housing market had been emerging. Yet interestingly on another note, we find higher down payment ratio leads to a substitution between housing and non-housing assets, leaving the aggregate household saving rate almost unchanged.","[Chen, Yanbin; Li, Fangxing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Zhesheng] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Renmin University of China; University of Pennsylvania,"Chen, YB (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",cyb@ruc.edu.cn; jasonlee851002@gmail.com; qzs_ruc@163.com,"Li, Fangxing/E-6023-2013",,,,,,52,3,4,1,27,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

In this article, it is shown that this approach is part of a family of widely used multilateral index number methods known as weighted GEKS. Here, the price index is constructed in two stages. First, elementary indexes are constructed between each period. Second, these bilateral indexes are aggregated into a transitive set of multilateral indexes using weighted least squares regression. We show that the repeat sales index has precisely this form and identify the specific elementary index formula and weights used. This observation provides a basis upon which to consider generalized repeat sales indexes which use different elementary indexes and weights. We apply some of these methods to repeat sales data and show that these choices matter empirically.","Moodys Econ Com, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",,"Melser, D (通讯作者)，Moodys Econ Com, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",danielmelser@gmail.com,,"Melser, Daniel/0000-0003-0452-818X",,,,,10,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

According to the first, the German surplus is the expression of a virtuous savings behaviour, to be extended to the periphery. The second maintains that the increase in net exports reflects the stagnation of German domestic demand. The paper argues that differences in price competitiveness are only part of the explanation of the disequilibria and that an expansion of German internal demand, albeit necessary, would not suffice to provide a viable response to the long-term sustainability of the euro area. Adopting a multilevel perspective, the paper argues that to understand the persistence of deficits in the European periphery, the main features of the reorganisation of the German economic system, including its income redistribution and demand implications, should be considered. Three elements are singled out: the effects of eastward enlargement, the impoverishment of the productive matrix of peripheral countries and the quality composition of trade flows. This analysis, it is argued, is a crucial premise for devising trade and industrial policies targeted on redressing the increasing skewness of EU trade, especially through greater trade among the deficit countries.","[Simonazzi, Annamaria; Nocella, Gianluigi] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Ginzburg, Andrea] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Simonazzi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Econ & Diritto, Rome, Italy.",annamaria.simonazzi@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,61,97,101,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, the association between Islam and FLFP greatly diminishes once other controls are included in the regression, suggesting that Islam might not diminish FLFP as some have argued. Moreover, once these additional controls are included, the association between Islam and FLFP is similar to that between Catholicism and FLFP. Countries where Protestantism is prevalent or where no religion is practised have higher FLFP. Finally, we find some evidence that the association between FLFP and religion is weakening over time.","[Bayanpourtehrani, Ghazal] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Sylwester, Kevin] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Sylwester, K (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, MC 4515, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",ksylwest@siu.edu,,,,,,,33,25,30,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Given that climate change is a world public bad, standard economic logic would predict that the United States would free ride and wait for other nations to reduce their emissions. Within the Congress, there are clear patterns to who votes in favor of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a political economy analysis of the determinants of pro-green votes on such legislation. Conservatives consistently vote against such legislation. Controlling for a representative's ideology, representatives from richer districts and districts with a lower per-capita carbon dioxide footprint are more likely to vote in favor of climate change mitigation legislation. Representatives from districts where industrial emissions represent a larger share of greenhouse gas emissions are more likely to vote no.","[Cragg, Michael I.] Brattle Grp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhou, Yuyu] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Gurney, Kevin] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kahn, Matthew E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",The Brattle Group; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Cragg, MI (通讯作者)，Brattle Grp, 44 Brattle St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Michael.cragg@brattle.edu; Yuyu.zhou@pnnl.gov; kevin.gurney@asu.edu; mkahn@ioe.ucla.edu,"Zhou, Yuyu/ABF-1638-2020","Zhou, Yuyu/0000-0003-1765-6789",Directorate For Geosciences; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [0846358] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Directorate For Geosciences; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),,,20,36,46,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

The calibrated model matches the nonlinearity of risk premia during crises and the speed of reversion in risk premia from a crisis back to precrisis levels. We evaluate the effect of three government policies: reducing intermediaries borrowing costs, injecting equity capital, and purchasing distressed assets. Injecting equity capital is particularly effective because it alleviates the equity capital constraint that drives the model's crisis.","[He, Zhiguo] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [He, Zhiguo; Krishnamurthy, Arvind] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Krishnamurthy, Arvind] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University,"He, ZG (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",zhiguo.he@chicagobooth.edu; a-krishnamurthy@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,54,379,512,5,111,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

While sometimes success or failure in production does not provide accurate information about the agents, there may be activities not directly related to production that constitute a more precise signal. I show that, when agents face reputation concerns, introducing these activities after a success improves efficiency, while introducing them after a failure reduces efficiency. Hence, nesting activities in the right way may offer a cheap toolbox to provide incentives. As an illustration, I consider a model where reputation concerns drive the hiring decisions of managers in a firm and I show how scapegoating, an activity nested after failures in production, generates inefficiencies. While hiring efficient workers increases the probability of success, hiring less efficient workers provides a buffer against reputation loses from failures, since managers can blame them more easily.","Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Ordoñez, G (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, 28 Hillhouse Av, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",guillermo.ordonez@yale.edu,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The novelty derives from three enhancements: (i) accounting for unconditional probabilities of the classes, (ii) computing the proportion of available Usefulness that the model captures, and (iii) weighting observations by their importance for the policymaker. The proposed measures are model free such that they can be used to assess early warning signals issued by any type of EWS, and flexible for any type of crisis. Applications to two renowned EWSs, and comparisons to two common evaluation measures, illustrate the importance of an objective criterion for choosing a final specification and threshold value, and for models to be useful, the need to be more concerned about the rare class and the importance of correctly classifying observations of most relevant entities.

While many disaggregate prices rise temporarily in response to a monetary tightening in the early part of the sample, there is no evidence of a price puzzle at the aggregate level. The share of disaggregate prices that exhibit the price puzzle diminishes from the early 1980s onwards. There also is evidence of a substantial decline in the dispersion of disaggregate price responses over time. This gradual decrease in cross-sectional heterogeneity of disaggregate price responses is associated with a dampening effect on aggregate real economic activity and a stronger effect on the aggregate price level. We illustrate by means of a multi-sector sticky-price model augmented by a cost channel how key structural parameters would have had to change to match this evolution of sectoral price dynamics.

The paper uses panel unit root and cointegration testing and specifies an appropriate vector error correction model to analyse the nexus between income and energy use. In doing so we contribute to an old debate using modern tools that shed a new light. There is some evidence that over the very short-run bidirectional causality exists. Our results also show a strong unidirectional causality running from capital formation and GDP to energy usage. In the long run the reverse causality, found in recent work, is lost. We then show that we can reproduce these earlier results in our data if we reproduce a slightly misspecified model for the Engle-Granger two-step procedure used in these earlier papers. Our findings thus imply that results are very sensitive to model misspecification and careful testing of specifications is required. Our results have some strong policy implications. They suggest that policies aimed at reducing energy usage or promoting energy efficiency are not likely to have a detrimental effect on economic growth, except over the very short run.

We followed a randomized campaign against electoral violence sponsored by an international NGO during the 2007 Nigerian elections. This paper investigates whether the effects of the campaign were transmitted indirectly through kinship, chatting, and geographical proximity. For individuals personally targeted by campaigners, we estimate the reinforcement effect of proximity to other targeted individuals. For individuals who self-report to be untargeted by campaigners, we estimate the diffusion of the campaign depending on proximity to targeted individuals. We find evidence for both effects, particularly on perceptions of violence. Effects are large in magnitude often similar to the average effect of the campaign. Kinship is the strongest channel of reinforcement and diffusion. We also find that geographical proximity transmits simple effects on perceptions, and that chatting conveys more complex effects on behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that RFI positively affects financial development measured very broadly as ratio of liquid liabilities to gross domestic product (GDP) when combined with a sufficient level of institutional quality. If institutional quality is below a threshold level, RFI apparently has negative effects on financial development. However, we cannot find any significant effects of RFI on the ratio of private credit to GDP or on the efficiency of the banking sector. Regarding the effects of RFI on access to and costs of finance of enterprises in SSA, our results are mixed. We can find no significant effect of RFI on access to finance for all firms in the aggregate, but the results indicate that RFI actually impedes small firms' access to finance. Furthermore, there is a significant positive influence of foreign bank involvement on the severity of the credit constraint for small enterprises, while we do not find such an influence for large enterprises. These results provide some support for the foreign bank barrier hypothesis in the context of RFI.","[Volz, Ulrich] DIE, D-53112 Bonn, Germany; [Frey, Leo] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Volz, U (通讯作者)，DIE, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53112 Bonn, Germany.",leo.frey@fu-berlin.de; ulrich.volz@die-gdi.de,,"Volz, Ulrich/0000-0001-9917-8068",,,,,86,7,9,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

There are two major findings. First, health care utilization (measured in terms of admissions, inpatient days, and outpatient visits to hospitals) increased significantly. Second, we also find a supply response but the size of the supply response differs across service types: while the number of beds increases, effects on the number of medical institutions, physicians, and nurses are either negligible or inconclusive. Our results suggest that countries planning a large expansion in health insurance coverage would need to generate sufficient financial resources to cover the surge in health care expenditures, both in the short and long run.

A special attention is paid to suitability of scenarios to particular learner groups (styles). Solution of learning scenarios quality evaluation and optimisation problem could help educational institutions to select suitable scenarios for particular learning styles. The research results will be implemented in iTEC - a four-year, largest pan-European e-learning R&D project focused on the design of the future classroom funded by 7th Framework Programme. A novel method of consecutive triple application of AHP is explored in more detail. Suitability of several iTEC scenarios to particular learner groups is also analysed in the paper. A number of multiple criteria decision analysis principles are applied to create a comprehensive quality model (criteria tree) for evaluating quality of scenarios. Several optimisation methods are explored and applied to optimise learning scenarios in conformity with particular learning style. Several practical examples of iTEC learning scenarios alternatives have been evaluated against the proposed MCEQLS AHP method. The research results have shown that the proposed MCEQLS AHP method is quite objective, exact and simple to use for selecting qualitative scenarios alternatives for particular learner groups.","[Kurilovas, Eugenijus] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kurilovas, Eugenijus; Zilinskiene, Inga] Vilnius State Univ, Inst Math & Informat, LT-08663 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius University,"Kurilovas, E (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",eugenijus.kurilovas@itc.smm.lt,,"Zilinskiene, Inga/0000-0001-7000-5198",,,,,46,27,28,0,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Due to the development of this mechanism, companies could adapt their business activities to the most of the impacts from the environment, providing thereby the highest profit at the end of the fiscal year. The purpose of this paper is to point out the principles of designing a model that could enable the enterprise to assess the most important impacts from the environment, quantifying their influence on its cost structure.

The findings indicate that owners over-estimate their home's value by around 2.5 per cent or $100 billion economy-wide. Importantly, the extent of mis-estimation depends upon the age of the home-owner and the size of the home.

Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and Russell 2000) based on a wide range of information, including equity VIX volatility, inflation expectations, interest rates, gold prices, and the USD/Euro exchange rate. The focus is on oil price returns, which have been previously found to exert mostly negative effects on U.S. stock returns. Identifying the crisis of 2008-2009 as a significant period of economic contraction and subsequent recovery, we check the stability of the stock-oil relationship by GARCH and MGARCH-DCC models. Prior to the financial crisis, stock returns are slightly (negatively) affected by oil prices and by the USD/Euro. For the subsample of mid-2009 onwards, however, stock returns are positively affected by oil prices and a weaker USD/Euro. As with inflation expectations, we interpret these findings as U.S. stocks responding positively to expectations of recovery worldwide. Our proposed explanation is due to the changing correlation between stock markets and oil, either by standard GARCH models or by MGARCH-DCC models allowing the implied correlation to vary over time.

However, theoretical models and empirical results offer conflicting evidence on the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth that we remain largely unsure of the cause-and-effect nature of this relationship, if indeed a relationship exists at all. This paper tests, in a panel context, the long-run relationship between energy access, and economic growth for fifteen African countries from 1980 to 2008 by using recently developed panel cointegration techniques. We adopt a three-stage approach, consisting of panel unit root, panel cointegration and Granger causality tests to study the dynamic causal relationships between energy consumption, energy prices and growth as well as relationship between electricity consumption, prices and growth. Results show that GDP and energy consumption as well as GDP and electricity move together in the long-run. By estimating these long-run relationships and testing for causality using panel-based error correction models, we found unidirectional long-run and short-run causality. The causality is running from GDP to energy consumption in the short-run, and from energy consumption to GDP in the long-run. There is also evidence of unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption to GDP in the long-run. This study thus provides empirical evidence of long-run and causal relationships between energy consumption and economic growth for our sample of fifteen countries: suggesting that lack or limited access to modern energy services could hamper economic growth and compromise the development prospects of these countries.

The model uses a demand-orientated approach to determine the main relationships, which explain growth through a virtuous cycle. The idea is to identify the driving forces of growth with causal linkages and feedback tendencies that enable the process to be self-sustained. We estimate the multi-equation growth model by 3SLS to capture more efficiently the interrelations between the main growth forces and to control for the endogeneity of the regressors. Our evidence shows that the proposed model can successfully explain the Portuguese growth performance, highlighting the importance of export competitiveness as the key factor in this process. The cumulative growth process was interrupted at some points mainly due to the incapacity to transfer productivity gains into domestic prices and to make the economy more competitive. We also show that capital accumulation does not affect productivity growth, and domestic prices do not improve export competitiveness. These are the main drawbacks of the Portuguese economy that could explain the failure to achieve higher growth rates in the period 1965-2006.","[Soukiazis, Elias] Univ Coimbra, Dept Econ, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal; [Antunes, Micaela] Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Aveiro,"Soukiazis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Dept Econ, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal.",,"Antunes, Micaela/AAD-8220-2020; Antunes, Micaela/GQZ-8240-2022","Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Soukiazis, Elias/0000-0001-9265-0438",,,,,28,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We examine the asymmetric impacts of monetary shocks on stock returns across high oil price events and non-high oil price events over the period from 1995 to 2008. We ask how these impacts respond to the relative ability of firms to obtain external finance. Our findings suggest that more energy-intensive industries and durable-goods industries react more significantly to monetary shocks based on high oil price events than on those based on non-high oil price events. By controlling for the capacity for external finance, the intraday windows reveal that a monetary surprise for the high oil price events has a bigger impact on stock returns than for the non-high oil price events. Firms with financing constraints find that the adverse impact of a surprise monetary policy action on high oil price events is amplified in the medium profitability category, while the impact of a surprise monetary policy action on non-high oil price events is amplified in the lowest profitability category.

Lessons from a Structural VAR Model with Block Exogeneity,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CURRENT ACCOUNT; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; MONETARY-POLICY; CAPITAL FLOWS,"During the 2000s, we observed the accumulation of global imbalances resulting primarily from massive current account imbalances in the USA and in Asia. This paper studies the impact of external shocks on East Asian countries in order to determine if these can account for the Asian side of global imbalances. To this end, we estimate a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model with block exogeneity using Bayesian inference. The three external shocks are an oil shock, a US monetary shock and a US financial shock. Our main findings are as follows: (i) external shocks account for the current account surplus in Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand and, to a lesser extent, in Japan and Indonesia; (ii) the oil shock and the US monetary shock seem to have influenced current account balances through real and monetary channels, and the US financial shock through the financial channel.","[Gosse, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Cambridge, CFAP, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Guillaumin, Cyriac] Univ Grenoble, CREG, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France",University of Cambridge; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Gossé, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, CFAP, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",jg548@cam.ac.uk; cyriac.guillaumin@upmf-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,43,5,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

More powerful rules relax allocative distortions at the cost of lower rent extraction. Hence, they should be found where the reformer is more concerned with stimulating investments by granting higher expected profits, and where rent extraction is less necessary since the extent of information asymmetries is more limited. This prediction is consistent with US power market data. During the 1990s, performance based contracts were signed by firms operating in states where generation costs were historically higher than those characterizing neighboring markets and the regulator had stronger incentives to exert information-gathering effort because elected instead of being appointed.

I find that discipline has an overall positive influence on student performance and that the racial gap in discipline stemming from cross-school variation in discipline policies is consistent with achievement maximization.

The plethora of incentives faced by workers and firms in job and insurance markets that determine the ultimate level of OSH are discussed in detail. The extensive empirical evidence from the hedonic wage and stated choice approaches used to assess the value of OSH is reviewed. The causes of inefficiency and inequity in the market for OSH, such as externalities, moral hazard in compensation insurance, systematic biases in individual risk perception/well-being and labour market segregation are subsequently examined. The implications of government intervention and regulation for tackling the aforementioned inefficiencies in OSH are then considered. Finally, the survey identifies areas of future research interests and suggests indicators and priorities for policy initiatives that can improve the health and safety of workers in modern job markets.","[Pouliakas, Konstantinos; Theodossiou, Ioannis] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, CELMR, Aberdeen AB9 1FX, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Pouliakas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, CELMR, Aberdeen AB9 1FX, Scotland.",,,,,,,,236,53,59,0,85,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Nevertheless, the difference emerges when comparing the accuracy level provided by these techniques, only some of them being able to handle the nonlinearities present in the data series. To reach meaningful results and gain an advantage in today's fast changing marketplace conditions, it is therefore necessary to dispose of powerful, predictive analytic methods. One such method is represented by Artificial Neural Networks which offer support for enhanced results when performing exchange rate forecasts. In this paper, differently configured multi-layered feed-forward networks using Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimization algorithm are developed to perform predictions on EUR/RON and CHF/RON time series. Results in terms of mean squared error are afterwards compared with those reached from using traditional Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average technique.

How effectively does the US higher education sector respond to labour market signals? We match US postsecondary degree completions from 1984 to 2008 with occupational employment statistics and employ an Instrumental Variable (IV) strategy to examine the supply response to changes in occupation specific demand. The supply of educated workers appears weakly responsive to short-term wage signals and moderately responsive to long-term employment conditions. Analysis reveals a sizeable degree of heterogeneity and lag in the responsiveness across specific occupation-degree pairings. Failure to respond rapidly to changes in labour demand may be one factor driving inequality in wages across occupations and in the aggregate economy. We suggest some simple policy measures to help increase the responsiveness of the higher education sector, both in terms of the output of specific degree programmes and the overall mix and composition of graduate completions.","[Hicks, Daniel L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Bardhan, Ashok; Jaffee, Dwight] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hicks, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",hicksd@ou.edu,,"Hicks, Daniel/0000-0002-1722-4970",,,,,26,20,31,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Due to these co-operations, the constant flow of employees and their intellectual capital require specific intercultural skills to successfully manage the transfer of knowledge across different cultures. The unlimited potential for innovation derived from this new intercultural knowledge based economic culture, should be carefully treated because is the key to economic progress. This knowledge's value is identified by many companies and, therefore, treasured and protected to a great extent. This protective attitude represents a considerable obstacle for international business co-operations. The paper explores how elements of culture e.g. values, attitudes, ways of communication, learning or even leadership styles amongst others, influence positively or negatively the transfer of knowledge between Eastern and Western European co-operations. Additionally, the research highlights how manager's intellectual capital sharing and employees' absorptive capacity and willingness to learn are impacted by culture. The qualitative research applies a phenomenological approach because it tries to understand social and cultural realities, which are based on people's experiences and the meanings attached to them. The data collection was conducted by in-depth interviews, (23) needed to reach theoretical saturation, non-participant and participant observation (7), focus groups (4) and fieldtrips notes in Russia and Austria. During the data collection, the grounded theory method of constant comparative analysis was used for the analysis. The researcher applied a fundamental shift from a mere comparative study of cross-cultural differences (nodal level) to the study of intercultural interactions (dyadic level). The research findings provide an awareness for academics (due to the lack of existing literature in the field at a dyadic level) about how own self-reference criteria, ethnocentric behaviours, competitiveness, hierarchies, knowledge alienation, cognitive understanding, risk taking or learning culture could limit or encourage knowledge transfer and its acceptance. For practitioners, understanding and integrating cultural diversity exponentially enlarge managers' intellectual capital and facilitate its transfer. It provides higher levels of competitive advantage by utilizing diversity, sharing knowledge and reciprocal learning, e.g. for innovation (product, process or social) and for the choice of standardization and/or adaptation strategies in international markets (degree of localization of product and communication strategies) and finally quicker and more successful market entry.","Vilnius Univ, Int Business Sch, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Bengoa, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Int Business Sch, Vilnius, Lithuania.",sanchezl@cytanet.com.cy,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,20,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,487,494,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000056,0

In an article titled Learning Unethical Practices from a Co-worker: The Peer Effect of Jose Canseco, published in Labour Economics in 2011, Eric Gould and Todd Kaplan use baseball player Jose Canseco to study peer effects among co-workers. Their analysis focuses on Canseco spreading knowledge of performance-enhancing drugs to teammates. The authors claim to find evidence of Canseco's influence through the improved performance of his former teammates. This paper reexamines the performance of Canseco's teammates and finds no empirical evidence of a performance improvement among Canseco's teammates.

We also decompose the overall loss into factor market distortions within provinces (between state and non-state sectors) and distortions between provinces (within sectors). Over the entire period, misallocation lowers aggregate non-agricultural TFP by an average of twenty percent. However, after initially declining, these losses increased appreciably beginning in the mid-1990s. This reversal can be attributed almost exclusively to increasing misallocation of capital between state and non-state sectors within provinces, while losses from between province misallocation remained fairly constant. We argue that the recent increase in capital market distortions is related to government policies that encourage investments in the state sector at the expense of investments in the more productive non-state sector.

The seller and buyer 1 interact ex post in such a way that each of them suffers a negative externality if the other possesses the item. We show that the optimal allocation rule favors buyer 2, who does not interact ex post with the seller, and in particular bidder 1 may not obtain the good even if his valuation is highest. The auction is therefore subject to resale. When resale is possible, the seller must distort the original auction. We show that the mechanism depends crucially on the way resale is organized ex post. The seller may decide to always allocate the good to the agent with the highest valuation when rents are fully extracted by an intermediary on the resale market. However, she may resort to a stochastic mechanism when the winner of the primary auction has full bargaining power in the resale stage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An applied general equilibrium analysis,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; mitigation; border tax adjustment; computable general equilibrium model,COMPETITIVENESS,"Concern that unilateral Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions could foster carbon leakage and undermine the international competitiveness of domestic industry has led to growing calls for carbon-based Border-Tax Adjustments (BTAs). This article uses a global general equilibrium model to assess the economic effects of BTAs and comes to three main conclusions. First, BTAs can reduce carbon leakage if the coalition of countries taking action to reduce GHG emissions is small, because in this case leakage (while typically small) mainly occurs through international trade competitiveness losses rather than through declines in world fossil fuel prices. Second, even though the economic effects of BTAs vary somewhat depending on how they are implemented, their welfare impact is typically small, and slightly negative at the world level. Third, and perhaps more strikingly, BTAs do not necessarily curb the output losses incurred by the domestic Energy Intensive-Industries (EIIs) they are intended to protect in the first place. This is in part because EIIs in industrialized countries make important use of carbon-intensive intermediate inputs produced by EIIs in other geographical areas. Another, deeper explanation is that EIIs are ultimately more adversely affected by the existence of a carbon price itself than by any international competitiveness losses. These findings are shown to be robust to key model parameters, country coverage, targets and design features of BTAs.","[Duval, Romain] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Burniaux, Jean-Marc; Chateau, Jean] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Environm Directorate, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Duval, R (通讯作者)，Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Dept Econ, Paris, France.",romain.duval@oecd.org,,,,,,,26,25,28,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Instead, we state three general properties of matching functions that allow us to establish the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium and characterize the impact of social ties on the labor market. In particular, we show that a monotonically increasing matching function in socialization level is a necessary and sufficient condition for having monotonically decreasing unemployment and increasing wage and market tightness.

We establish a condition under which a monotonically increasing matching function produces a vacancy rate that first increases in socialization level, but then decreases.","Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Chuhay, R (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Moscow, Russia.",rchuhay@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This paper considers some practical implications of a variable VAT. It then develops a dynamic general equilibrium model to assess its usefulness as a stabilization instrument. A variable rate VAT would no longer be less distortionary than other taxes. It would distort between current and future consumption, i.e. savings and investment decisions, and hence raise the economic costs of taxation. Moreover, a variable VAT would be less effective in dampening business cycles than the conventional stabilization tool, an interest rate. This is because of the additional adverse supply effects. A change in the interest rate affects this period's savings and investment decisions, whereas a variable VAT rate would influence savings and investment decisions over time. A variable VAT rate is therefore unlikely to be a useful stabilization instrument. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to explain this regularity, we provide a model where political cohesion is linked to the emergence of a fully functioning market economy. Without market exchange, the welfare of inherently selfish individuals will be mutually independent. Whoever has greater bargaining power will be willing to make decisions that enhance the productivity of their supporters at the expense of other groups in society. If the gains from specialization are sufficiently large, however, a market economy will emerge. From being essentially non-cohesive under self-sufficiency, the political decision-making process becomes cohesive in the market economy, because the welfare of individuals will be mutually interdependent as a result of the exchange of goods.","[Dalgaard, Carl-Johan] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Olsson, Ola] Univ Gothenburg, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Copenhagen; University of Gothenburg,"Dalgaard, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",carl.johan.dalgaard@econ.ku.dk; ola.olsson@economics.gu.se,,"Olsson, Ola/0000-0003-2125-2672",,,,,42,3,4,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Although many of the techniques discussed here can be transported across different information environments, some are specific to particular models. Models of social interactions are also surveyed.

In an environment where commodity taxes are allowed to be nonlinear functions of income and consumption, we derive an analytical expression that reveals the forces determining optimal commodity taxation. We then calibrate the model to evidence on the relationship between skills and preferences and extensively examine the quantitative case for taxes on future consumption (saving). In our baseline case of a unit intertemporal elasticity, optimal capital income tax rates are 2% on average and 4.5% on high earners. We find that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution has a substantial effect on optimal capital taxation. If the intertemporal elasticity is one-third, the optimal capital income tax rates rise to 15% on average and 23% on high earners; if the intertemporal elasticity is two, the optimal rates fall to 0.6% on average and 1.6% on high earners. Nevertheless, in all cases that we consider the welfare gains of using optimal capital taxes are small. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An importance of energy system is obvious in our life. There are many important energy applications. There are heating and cooling, power generation, desalination, air conditioning and so on. By the year 2020 world will need 50% more energy than today and the Asia-Pacific region will become world's largest consumer of energy. In 21-st century, world faces with the challenge of converting its fossil fuels energy base to the sustainable energy sources. Regarding the increasing rise of the energy demand and consumption, virtually everyone in the world must implement an integrated resource planning (IRP). It is vitally important to achieve sustainable growth. Sustainability assessment of energy system is one of the important issues in policy making all around the world. Decision making on energy system is very risky and difficult and therefore cannot be individual. Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a renowned methodology in decision making and evaluation. Some of the most famous MCDM tools are as following: AHP, ANP, TOPSIS, ELECTRE, MUSA, AKUTA, VIKOR, PROMETHEE, SAW, MOORA, COPRAS, COPRAS-G, SWARA, FARE. A Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method is one of the new MCDM methods presented in 2010. SWARA method is applied for some reasons in this paper. Firstly, SWARA's perspective is different from other similar methods like AHP, ANP and FARE. SWARA gives the chance for decision and policy makers to select their priority based on the current situation of environment and economy. In this method, expert has an important role on evaluations and calculating weights. The ability to estimate experts' opinion about importance ratio of the criteria is the main element of this method. SWARA is developed for identifying importance of criteria and relative weights of each criterion. Current research applies SWARA as a new framework for evaluating and prioritizing sustainability assessment indicators of energy system. General indicator system consists of Resource Indicator, Environment Indicator, Economic Indicator and Social Indicator and their sub-criterions. For instance, complex environmental indicator consists of CO2, SO2 and NOX indicators while complex economic indicator consists of energy costs, investment and efficiency indicators. The research revealed that the most important indicator is Social (0.342). Then, the range of indicators is as following: Environmental (0.284), Economic (0.212) and Resource (0.162). Finally, the research shows that this methodology can be useful as a framework to operate with sustainability assessment indicators of the energy system. Also, this methodology can be used for decision making in real issues of future researches in different areas. The results of this methodology also can be compared to other methods such as AHP and ANP.","[Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Saparauskas, Jonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Amirkabir University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Hashemkhani Zolfani, S (通讯作者)，Amirkabir Univ Technol, POB 1585-4413, Tehran, Iran.",sa.hashemkhani@gmail.com; jonas.saparauskas@vgtu.lt,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani/AAA-9918-2021",,,,,,52,120,121,5,91,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Conducting a survey in which 30 companies in the Singapore construction industry participated, this study first identified the degree of project delay in 220 traditional and 96 green construction projects performed in Singapore. Next, a set of factors affecting project delay was identified based on various literatures to determine the most influential factors for both green and traditional projects. The analysis result established that 15.91% of the traditional projects were delayed while 32.29% of the green construction projects were completed behind schedule. Furthermore, the top 5 factors causing delay in green projects were: (1) speed of decision making by client; (2) speed of decision making involving all project teams; (3) communication/coordination between key parties; (4) level of experience of consultants; and (5) difficulties in financing project by contractors. Lastly, recommendations were introduced to reduce schedule delay in green construction projects based on the analysis results.

We revisit these conclusions using theory and data on inventories. We study an economy with nominal rigidities in which goods are storable. Our theory predicts that if costs of production are sticky and markups do not vary much in response to, say, expansionary monetary policy, firms react by excessively accumulating inventories in anticipation of future cost increases. In contrast, if the data inventories are fairly constant over the cycle and in response to changes in monetary policy. We show that costs must increase and markups must decline sufficiently in times of a monetary expansion in order to reduce firm's incentive to hold inventories and thus bring the model's inventory predictions in line with the data. Versions of the model consistent with the dynamics of inventories in the data imply that countercyclical markups account for a sizable fraction of the response of real variables to monetary shocks.","[Kryvtsov, Oleksiy] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Midrigan, Virgiliu] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; [Midrigan, Virgiliu] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Bank of Canada; Federal Reserve System - USA; New York University,"Kryvtsov, O (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,"Kryvtsov, Oleksiy/0000-0001-5765-8290",,,,,40,22,29,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

However, the effects that these have on oil consumption and price vary. If market power is present in the oil market, the directions of change in consumption and price might contrast with those in a competitive market. As a result, the market structure affects not only the effectiveness of the policy instruments used to reduce oil consumption, but also the terms of trade and carbon leakage. In particular, reduced oil consumption, as a result of increased fuel-efficiency standards, will unambiguously increase the price of oil under a monopoly.","[Kverndokk, Snorre] Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] UMB Sch Econ & Business, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Norway Stat Norway, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Statistics Norway,"Kverndokk, S (通讯作者)，Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway.",snorre.kverndokk@frisch.uio.no; knut.einar.rosendahl@umb.no,,"Rosendahl, Knut Einar/0000-0002-8066-6261",,,,,42,5,5,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

While, in addition to the above mentioned, governmental organizations are faced with some more cases. One of these cases is stewardship activity, which compels them to increase outsourcing services. On the basis of the increasing healthcare system efficiency, outsourcing of services was proposed and performed as one of the strategic doctrine in health services of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The authors aimed to collect information from health sectors in order to describe participants' attitudes towards the availability of the health services by establishing associative health centers. In this cross-sectional study, access and quality were assessed using a valid and reliable questionnaire attitude evaluation of service recipients in associative health centers towards access and quality of healthcare services. Issues such as distance, time and cost in the dimension of access and also quality of the physical space, equipment, human resource, and services in the dimension of quality were evaluated from the view point of recipients of associative health centers in South of Tehran, Rey and Eslamshahr health networks. Adults (n=380) referring to the associative health centers completed the questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the difference between participants' attitude towards these three health networks. A positive attitude towards improvement of distance and time of access to health centers, and reduction of costs by establishing associative health centers were observed. Also positive attitude towards quality of physical space, equipment, human resource, and services was found. The findings indicate that inauguration of associative health centers has an effective role on increasing the access and quality of healthcare for the population covered by Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Accordingly, in the case of continuing of outsourcing and stability of allocating credit, good and high quality services can be provided.","[Lashgari, Shima; Delavari, Alireza; Kheirkhah, Omid] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Lashgari, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran Med Sci, 49 Italy St Ghods St Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran, Iran.",shimalashgari@yahoo.com; delavari@tums.ac.ir; kheyrkhah@farabi.tums.ac.ir; jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt,"Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018","Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216",,,,,44,5,5,1,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Our model has multidimensional types, private values, nonnegative prices, and quasilinear preferences for the players with one relaxation - the players are subject to publicly known budget constraints. We show that the space we study essentially includes one type of mechanisms: autocratic mechanisms (a form of dictatorship). Furthermore, we prove that there are families of autocratic mechanisms that uniquely fulfill the basic properties of deterministic, dominant-strategy incentive compatible, individually rational, and Pareto efficient. The mechanisms in the autocratic families are identical except for two to three price parameters that differentiate them.","[Lerner, Anat; Gonen, Rica] Open Univ Israel, Raanana, Israel",Open University Israel,"Gonen, R (通讯作者)，Open Univ Israel, Raanana, Israel.",anat@cs.openu.ac.il; gonenr@openu.ac.il,"Lerner, Anat/J-5453-2015","Lerner, Anat/0000-0002-9293-3195",,,,,18,3,3,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We find that speaking Spanish at home reduces test scores, but has no significant effect on completed schooling. The reduction in test scores (1) increases in magnitude in three of the tests when the parents are more educated; (2) is much more dramatic when the choice of home language is made endogenous; and (3) is not systematically greater for the verbal than for the math tests.

As a development intervention deeply intertwined with processes of financialisation, we study the expansion and workings of microfinance on three dimensions. First, microfinance's appeal is built on positive mobilising narratives which present poverty as a problem of finance, and portray it as superior solution relative to charity or other redistributive alternatives. Second, microfinance as a financial system exerts a governmentality which works through technologies of the selffor disciplinary individuals to uphold regularity in capital flows. Third, in this way microfinance makes possible the extraction of surplus value from its poor borrowers, who may not have much choice, at a considerable scale. We conclude that these three dimensions help to explain the ways in which financial systems overall operate and expand.","Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Mader, P (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany.",mader@mpifg.de,,"Mader, Philip/0000-0002-8833-1917",,,,,57,4,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are expected to be drivers of actual economic situation. In present-day Europe the proportion of SMEs in the total number of enterprises represents around 80 % and roughly 75 % of jobs and SME business units represent approximately 98 % of business units in the whole Czech Republic. SMEs also provide approximately 80 % of all jobs on labor market In our country. The aim of this paper is to present the analysis of SME requirements on non-ICT knowledge and skills of ICT managers in the Czech Republic. Here presented analysis takes into account differences between small and medium companies in requirements on ICT managers. The results part contains detailed analysis about companies' requirements on non-ICT knowledge. The article is divided into two main parts. The first part briefly describes actual situation in innovations processes In SMEs (macroeconomic data analysis from Czech Statistical Office) in the Czech Republic and it describes methodology and the most important Information about survey that provides information presented in this paper. The methodology frame uses the SMEs specification as is applied in EU. There are used statistical methods for evaluation of,non-ICT knowledge. The second part contains results from the analysis about companies' requirements on ICT managers non-ICT knowledge with accent on differences between small and medium enterprises. Conclusions are devoted to comparison of category of SMEs to category of large corporation in the Czech economy. Requirements of companies on ICT managers do not depend on the size of the company very much. We identified larger requirements on ICT knowledge by small enterprises; on the other hand medium enterprises have higher requirements on on-ICT knowledge and skills.","Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Informat Technol, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,maryskam@vse.cz; doucek@vse.cz,"Maryska, Milos/D-5603-2009; Doucek, Petr/A-7703-2015",,,,,,17,0,0,0,7,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,372,380,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300039,0
