In our model, the common trend is estimated nonparametrically, while the idiosyncratic dynamics are assumed to follow univariate MEMs. Estimation theory based on seminonparametric methods is developed for this class of models for large cross-sections and large time dimensions. The methodology is illustrated using two panels of realized volatility measures between 2001 and 2008: the SPDR Sectoral Indices of the S&P500 and the constituents of the S&P100. Results show that the shape of the common volatility trend captures the overall level of risk in the market and that the idiosyncratic dynamics have a heterogeneous degree of persistence around the trend. Out-of-sample forecasting shows that the proposed methodology improves volatility prediction over several benchmark specifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we exploit seemingly exogenous variation in incidence rates between Swedish regions to estimate the impact of the pandemic. The pandemic led to a significant increase in poorhouse rates. There is also evidence that capital returns were negatively affected by the pandemic.

Randomized controlled trials are a key source of evidence for these comparisons. The techniques of network meta-analysis allow the networks of trial evidence to be evaluated to obtain estimates of comparative efficacy between sets of treatments. These techniques may be the only source of estimates of comparative effectiveness if trials directly comparing the treatments of interest have not been conducted, and may provide useful additional evidence if both direct and indirect comparisons exist. Methods: We examined both published and draft guidelines from reimbursement and health technology appraisal bodies, and considered their recommendations using appropriate methodology for the conduct of indirect comparisons and the assessments of their validity. Results: Guidelines from 33 countries were reviewed. Of these, guidelines from 9 countries-Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Scotland, Spain, South Africa, and the United Kingdom (England and Wales)-included detailed recommendations on the conduct of network meta-analysis. The recommendations were summarized. Conclusions: No two recommendations from the multiple national guidelines are mutually exclusive.

Methods: A clinical trial-based economic evaluation was performed in which the net costs and effectiveness of the two treatment modalities were calculated and expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The clinical outcome of interest for the evaluation was the rate of severe hypoglycemia in each arm of the LGS study. Quality-of-life utility scores were calculated using the three level EuroQol five dimensional questionnaire. Resource use costs were estimated using public sources. Results: After 6 months, the use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with LGS significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoglycemia compared with standard pump therapy (incident rate difference 1.85 [0.17-3.53]; p = 0.037). Based on a primary randomized study, the ICER per severe hypoglycemic event avoided was $18,257 for all patients and $14,944 for those aged 12 years and older. Including all major medical resource costs (e.g., hospital admissions), the ICERs were $17,602 and $14,289, respectively. Over the 6-month period, the cost per quality adjusted life year gained was $40,803 for patients aged 12 years and older. Conclusions: Based on the Australian experience evaluating new interventions across a broad range of therapeutic areas, sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with LGS may be considered a cost-effective alternative to standard pump therapy with self-monitoring of blood glucose in hypoglycemia unaware patients with type 1 diabetes.","[Ly, Trang T.; Jones, Timothy W.] Princess Margaret Hosp Children, Dept Endocrinol & Diabet, Perth, WA 6840, Australia; [Ly, Trang T.; Jones, Timothy W.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Child Hlth Res, Telethon Inst Child Hlth Res, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Ly, Trang T.; Jones, Timothy W.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Paediat & Child Hlth, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Brnabic, Alan J.

The heterogeneous impact of medicaid managed care,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Medicaid; Managed care; Child health,HEALTH-INSURANCE; PLAN PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATIONS; QUALITY; INCENTIVES; MIGRATION; VARIABLES; STATE; US,Evaluating Accountable Care Organizations is difficult because there is a great deal of heterogeneity in terms of their reimbursement incentives and other programmatic features. We examine how variation in reimbursement incentives and administration among two Medicaid managed care plans impacts utilization and spending. We use a quasi-experimental approach exploiting the timing and county-specific implementation of Medicaid managed care mandates in two contiguous regions of Kentucky. We find large differences in the relative success of each plan in reducing utilization and spending that are likely driven by important differences in plan design. The plan that capitated primary care physicians and contracted out many administrative responsibilities to an experienced managed care organization achieved significant reductions in outpatient and professional utilization. The plan that opted for a fee-for-service reimbursement scheme with a group withhold and handled administration internally saw a much more modest reduction in outpatient utilization and an increase in professional utilization.

An Exploration of the Potential Impact of Cognitive Functioning in Discrete Choice Experiments with Older People in Health Care,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,cognition; discrete choice experiments; older people,MINI-MENTAL-STATE; LOGIT-MODELS,"Objectives: This exploratory study sought to investigate the effect of cognitive functioning on the consistency of individual responses to a discrete choice experiment (DCE) study conducted exclusively with older people. Methods: A DCE to investigate preferences for multi-disciplinary rehabilitation was administered to a consenting sample of older patients (aged 65 years and older) after surgery to repair a fractured hip (N = 84). Conditional logit, mixed logit, heteroscedastic conditional logit, and generalized multinomial logit regression models were used to analyze the DCE data and to explore the relationship between the level of cognitive functioning (specifically the absence or presence of mild cognitive impairment as assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination) and preference and scale heterogeneity. Results: Both the heteroscedastic conditional logit and generalized multinomial logit models indicated that the presence of mild cognitive impairment did not have a significant effect on the consistency of responses to the DCE. Conclusions: This study provides important preliminary evidence relating to the effect of mild cognitive impairment on DCE responses for older people. It is important that further research be conducted in larger samples and more diverse populations to further substantiate the findings from this exploratory study and to assess the practicality and validity of the DCE approach with populations of older people.","[Milte, Rachel; Miller, Michelle] Flinders Univ S Australia, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Ratcliffe, Julie; Chen, Gang] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Lancsar, Emily] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Crotty, Maria] Flinders Univ S Australia, Dept Rehabil & Aged Care, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Flinders University South Australia; Monash University; Flinders University South Australia,"Ratcliffe, J (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Clin Effectiveness, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",julie.ratcliffe@flinders.edu.au,"Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011; Milte, Rachel/ABB-2801-2021; Milte, Rachel/A-8452-2017; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Milte, Rachel/0000-0001-7533-6260; Milte, Rachel/0000-0001-7533-6260; Chen, Gang/0000-0002-8385-5965; Lancsar, Emily/0000-0003-2404-6735; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988; Miller, Michelle/0000-0002-4435-4148; Crotty, Maria/0000-0002-2996-5135",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Strategic Award Grant [402791],Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Strategic Award Grant(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),Financial support for this study was provided in part by an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Strategic Award Grant 402791 titled Transition Care: Innovation and Evidence.

The funding of medical devices has followed this progression, with incorporation into the NHI reimbursement system in 2000 (several years later than pharmaceuticals), but important issues affecting patient access remain. Although the effect of devices on the NHI budget is relatively modest (only about 4%), because of concerns about NHI sustainability, attention has increasingly been paid to their management and funding. Unlike pharmaceuticals, however, it has been quite challenging to develop clear and fair criteria for reimbursement coverage and pricing of medical devices. The two key and longstanding issues around the reimbursement of medical devices in Korea are how to expedite market entry of improved or innovative medical devices at appropriate prices, and how to satisfactorily lower the reimbursement levels of older devices, thereby making headroom for new technologies to be reimbursed. Despite protracted discussions over the last decade, industry and government have been unable to reach full agreement. There has been some progress (e.g., introduction of the Value Appraisal and the Revaluation Systems), but there remains urgent need for productive discussion and consensus between government and industry regarding reasonable funding rules, transparency, and clarity in the reimbursement pricing process for medical devices.","[Lee, Sang-Soo] Medtron Korea Co Ltd, Seoul 135280, South Korea; [Salole, Eugene] Value Based Access Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Lee, SS (通讯作者)，Medtron Korea Co Ltd, 5F,Sajo Bldg 1001,Daechi Dong, Seoul 135280, South Korea.",sang.soo.lee@medtronic.com,,,,,,,9,11,11,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,476,481,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.03.1719,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24969010.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900023,0

The criterion compares reactions to 'lossy' transfers among the poor. We focus on the class of rank-dependent poverty measures and provide distribution-sensitivity rankings of the poverty gap ratio, the first and second Sen measures, the Thon measure, the Shorrocks measure, and the Thon, Kakwani and S-Gini classes of measures. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between the proposed criterion and two alternative distribution-sensitivity criteria based on the Arrow-Pratt theory of risk aversion. Finally, we provide an empirically tractable necessary and sufficient condition for unanimous poverty rankings by all continuous and replication invariant rank-dependent poverty measures that exhibit a predetermined minimum degree of distribution-sensitivity.

The investor invests in a liquid financial market to partially hedge cash flow risk and estimation risk. We derive two 3-dimensional non-linear free-boundary PDEs satisfied by the utility-based prices of the option and cash flows. We provide an approach to measure the information value. A numerical procedure is developed. We show that investors have not only idiosyncratic-risk-induced but also estimation-risk-induced precautionary saving demands. A growth of estimation risk, risk aversion or project risk delays investment, but it is accelerated if the project is more closely correlated with the market. Partial information results in a considerable loss, which reaches the peak value at the exercising time and increases with project risk and estimation risk. The more risk-averse the investor or the weaker the correlation, the larger the loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, our aim is to find an appropriate and easily implemented method for estimating and testing coefficients in predictive regression models. We apply a projection method to remove the embedded endogeneity and then adopt a two-step estimation procedure to manage both highly persistent and nonstationary predictors. The asymptotic distributions of these estimates are established under a-mixing innovations, and different convergence rates among the coefficients are derived for different persistent degrees. We also consider the model with the regressor having a drift in its autoregressive model and show that the asymptotic properties for the estimated coefficients are totally different from the case without drift. To conduct a misspecification test, we rely on the deduced asymptotic distributions and use the Monte Carlo simulation to find the appropriate critical values. A Monte Carlo experiment is then conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of our proposed estimator and test statistics. Finally, an empirical example is examined to demonstrate the proposed estimation and testing method.

We exploit cross-state variation in the timing of such legislation to analyze its impact on organ donations by living and deceased persons, on measures of the quality of the transplants, and on the number of bone marrow donations. We find that these provisions do not have a significant impact on the quantity of organs donated. The leave laws, however, do have a positive impact on bone marrow donations, and the effect increases with the size of the population of beneficiaries and with the generosity of the legislative provisions. Our results suggest that this legislation works for moderately invasive procedures such as bone marrow donation, but these incentives may be too low for organ donation, which is riskier and more burdensome.

Depending on whether this lag truncation parameter is specified to grow at a slower rate than or the same rate as the sample size, we obtain two types of asymptotic approximations: the small-b asymptotics and the fixed-b asymptotics. Using techniques for probability distribution approximation and high order expansions, this paper shows that the fixed-b asymptotic approximation provides a higher order refinement to the first order small-b asymptotics. This result provides a theoretical justification on the use of the fixed-b asymptotics in empirical applications. On the basis of the fixed-b asymptotics and higher order small-b asymptotics, the paper introduces a new and easy-to-use asymptotic F test that employs a finite sample corrected Wald statistic and uses an F-distribution as the reference distribution. Finally, the paper develops a bandwidth selection rule that is testing-optimal in that the bandwidth minimizes the type II error of the asymptotic F test while controlling for its type I error. Monte Carlo simulations show that the asymptotic F test with the testing-optimal bandwidth works very well in finite samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers commonly report the vector of pointwise posterior medians of the impulse responses as a measure of central tendency of the estimated response functions, along with pointwise 68% posterior error bands. It can be shown that this approach cannot be used to characterize the central tendency of the structural impulse response functions. We propose an alternative method of summarizing the evidence from sign-identified VAR models designed to enhance their practical usefulness. Our objective is to characterize the most likely admissible model(s) within the set of structural VAR models that satisfy the sign restrictions. We show how the set of most likely structural response functions can be computed from the posterior mode of the joint distribution of admissible models both in the fully identified and in the partially identified case, and we propose a highest-posterior density credible set that characterizes the joint uncertainty about this set. Our approach can also be used to resolve the long-standing problem of how to conduct joint inference on sets of structural impulse response functions in exactly identified VAR models. We illustrate the differences between our approach and the traditional approach for the analysis of the effects of monetary policy shocks and of the effects of oil demand and oil supply shocks.

J,"Lammers, E",,,,"Lammers, Eric",,,THE EFFECT OF HOSPITAL-PHYSICIAN INTEGRATION ON HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,hospitals; physicians; vertical integration; health information technology; transaction cost economics,ORDER ENTRY SYSTEMS; CARE; RECORDS,"ABSTRACT The US federal government has recently made a substantial investment to enhance the US health information technology (IT) infrastructure. Previous literature on the impact of IT on firm performance across multiple industries has emphasized the importance of a process of co-invention whereby organizations develop complementary practices to achieve greater benefit from their IT investments. In health care, employment of physicians by hospitals can confer greater administrative control to hospitals over physicians' actions and resources and thus enable the implementation of new technology and initiatives aimed at maximizing benefit from use of the technology. In this study, I tested for the relationship between hospital employment of physicians and hospitals' propensity to use health IT. I used state laws that prohibit hospital employment of physicians as an instrument to account for the endogenous relationship with hospital IT use. Hospital employment of physicians is associated with significant increases in the probability of hospital health IT use. Therefore, subsidization of health IT among hospitals not employing physicians may be less efficient. Furthermore, state laws prohibiting hospitals from employing physicians may inhibit adoption of health IT, thus working against policy initiatives aimed at promoting use of the technology.

We show that no firm does worse at any pure equilibrium under price-matching relative to Bertrand, but as capacity increases, one or both firms do better relative to Bertrand. If the firms choose their capacities simultaneously before making pricing decisions, then the effect of price-matching varies with the cost of capacity. Specifically, when the cost is high price-matching either (i) has no effect on the market price, i.e., the market price associated with the pure SPEs is the Cournot one, or (ii) weakly decreases the market price relative to Cournot. Furthermore, when the cost is low price-matching leads to a set of (pure) SPE prices that includes the Cournot price in the interior. Therefore, price-matching does not necessarily benefit the firms when firms select their capacities before competing in price. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A microsimulation model evaluated costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of EWC program mammography policy options on coverage for digital mammography (which has a higher cost than film mammography but recent legislation allowed reimbursement at the lower film rate); screening eligibility age; and screening frequency. Model inputs were based on analyses of program claims data linked to California Cancer Registry data, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, and the Medi-Cal literature. Outcomes included number of procedures, cancers, cancer deaths, costs, and incremental cost per life year. Results: Projected model outcomes matched program data closely. With restrictions on the number of clients screened, strategies starting screening at age 40 years were dominated (not cost-effective). This finding was highly robust in sensitivity analyses. Compared with no screening, biennial film mammography for women aged SO to 64 years was projected to reduce 15-year breast cancer mortality by nearly 7.8% at $18,999 per additional life-year, annual film mammography was $106,428 per additional life-year, and digital mammography $180,333 per additional life-year. This more effective, more expensive strategy was projected to reduce breast cancer mortality by 8.6%. Under equal mammography reimbursement, biennial digital mammography beginning at age 50 years was projected to decrease 15 year breast cancer mortality by 8.6% at an incremental cost per additional life-year of $17,050. Conclusions: For the EWC program, biennial screening mammography starting at age 50 years was the most cost-effective strategy. The impact of digital mammography on life expectancy was small. Program-specific cost-effectiveness analysis can be completed in a policy relevant time frame to assist policymakers faced with difficult program choices.","[Melnikow, Joy; Tancredi, Daniel J.; Yang, Zhuo; Ritley, Dominique; Jiang, Yun; Slee, Christina] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Healthcare Policy & Res, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Popova, Svetlana; Rylett, Phillip; Knutson, Kirsten; Smalley, Sherie] Calif Dept Publ Hlth, Every Woman Counts Program, Canc Detect Sect, Sacramento, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; California Department of Public Health,"Melnikow, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Healthcare Policy & Res, 2103 Stockton Blvd,Ste 2226, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.",jamelnikow@ucdavis.edu,"Tancredi, Daniel J/O-3381-2013; yang, zhuo/D-7378-2018","Tancredi, Daniel J/0000-0002-3884-7907; Yang, Zhuo/0000-0002-8158-3003; yang, zhuo/0000-0003-1998-1104",,,,,41,11,12,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,932,941,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.013,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041343.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700004,0

We quantify the degree of persistence in MH problems using nationally representative, longitudinal data from Australia and system generalized method of moments (GMM), and correlated random effects approaches are applied to separate true from spurious state dependence. Our results suggest only a moderate degree of persistence in MH problems when assuming that persistence is constant across the MH distribution once individual-specific heterogeneity is accounted for. However, individuals who fell once below a threshold that indicates an episode of depression are up to five times more likely to experience such a low score again a year later, indicating a strong element of state dependence in depression. Low income is a strong risk factor in state dependence for both men and women, which has important policy implications.

Methods: We searched PubMed for English-language articles related to WTP for diagnostic laboratory tests published from 1985 through 2011. We characterized methodological differences across studies, examined individual- and technology-level factors associated with WTP, and summarized median WTP values across different diagnostic tests. Results: We identified 66 relevant WTP studies. Half focused on oncology, while others analyzed infectious diseases (n = 11, 16.1%) and obstetric or gynecological conditions (n = 8, 11.7%), among others. Most laboratory tests included in studies were biological samples/genetic testing (n = 44, 61.1%) or imaging tests (n = 23, 31.9%). Approximately one third of the analyses (n = 20, 30.3%) used discrete-choice questions to elicit WTP values. Higher income, education, disease severity, perceived disease risk, family history, and more accurate tests were in general associated with higher WTP values for diagnostic information. Of the 44 studies with median WTP values available, most reported a median WTP value below $100. The median WTP value for colon or colorectal cancer screening ranged from below $100 to over $1000. Conclusions: The contingent valuation literature in diagnostics has grown rapidly, and suggests that many respondents place considerable value on diagnostic information. There exists, however, great variation in studies with respect to the type of technologies and diseases assessed, respondent characteristics, and study methodology. The perceived value of diagnostic technologies is also influenced by the study design and elicitation methods.","[Lin, Pei-Jung; Cangelosi, Michael J.; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Lee, David W.] GE Healthcare, Hlth Econ & Reimbursement Amer, Wauwatosa, WI USA",Tufts Medical Center; General Electric,"Lin, PJ (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St,Box 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",plin@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,"Cangelosi, Michael/HNJ-5671-2023; Cangelosi, Michael/AAJ-9249-2021","Cangelosi, Michael/0000-0002-8711-0215",GE Healthcare,GE Healthcare(General ElectricGE Healthcare),Source of financial support: Funding of this research was provided by GE Healthcare.

Methods: Data come from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), a cross-sectional survey carried out on representative samples of 21,425 individuals from the noninstitutionalized adult general population of six European countries (response rate = 61.2%). The SF-12 was administered and scored according to three algorithms: the original method (mental component summary of SF-12 [MCS-12]), the RAND-12 (RAND-12 Mental Health Composite [RAND-12 MHC]), and the Bidemensional Response Process Model 12 mental health score (BRP-12 MHS), based on a two-factor Item Response Theory graded response model. Thirty-day and 12-month depressive disorders (major depressive episode or dysthymia) were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Version 3.0, by using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curves analysis was carried out, and optimal cutoff points maximizing balance between sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) were chosen for the three methods. Results: Prevalence of 30-day and 12-month depressive disorders in the overall sample was 1.5% and 4.4%, respectively. The area under the curve for 30-day depressive disorders was 0.92, and it decreased to 0.85 for 12-month disorders, regardless of the scoring method. Optimal cutoff for 30-day depressive disorders was 45.6 (SN = 0.86; SP = 0.88) for the MCS-12, 44.5 for the RAND-12 MHC (SN = 0.87, SP = 0.86), and 40.2 for the BRP-12 MHS (SN = 0.87, SP = 0.87). The selected 12-month cutoffs for MCS-12 and RAND-12 MHC were between 4.2 and 5.8 points below the general population means of each country, with SN range 0.67 to 0.78 and SP range 0.77 to 0.87. Conclusions: The SF-12 yielded acceptable results for detecting both active and recent depressive disorders in general population samples, suggesting that the questionnaire could be used as a useful screening tool for monitoring the prevalence of affective disorders and for targeting treatment and prevention.","[Vilagut, Gemma; Forero, Carlos G.; Ferrer, Montserrat; Alonso, Jordi] IMIM Hosp del Mar, Med Res Inst, Hlth Serv Res Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Vilagut, Gemma; Forero, Carlos G.; Ferrer, Montserrat; Alonso, Jordi] CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain; [Vilagut, Gemma; Alonso, Jordi] Pompeu Fabra Univ UPF, Barcelona, Spain; [Pinto-Meza, Alejandra; Haro, Josep M.] CIBER Salud Mental CIBERSAM, Madrid, Spain; [de Graaf, Ron] Netherlands Inst Mental Hlth & Addict, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bruffaerts, Ronny] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium; [Kovess, Viviane] Paris Descartes Univ, Paris, France; [Kovess, Viviane] EHESP, Dept Epidemiol, Paris, France; [de Girolamo, Giovanni] Clin Res Ctr, IRCCS St John God, Brescia, Italy; [Matschinger, Herbert] Univ Leipzig, Inst Social Med Occupat Hlth & Publ Hlth, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Ferrer, Montserrat] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Pompeu Fabra University; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERSAM; Trimbos Institute; KU Leuven; Universite Paris Cite; Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sante Publique (EHESP); Leipzig University; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Vilagut, G (通讯作者)，IMIM Hosp del Mar, Med Res Inst, Hlth Serv Res Unit, Barcelona Biomed Res Pk,Doctor Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",gvilagut@imim.es,"Ferrer, Montse/A-5510-2010; PRISMA, Grupo/AAI-6753-2021; Alonso, Jordi/A-5514-2010; BRUFFAERTS, RONNY/AAA-2364-2021; García-Forero, Carlos/H-3219-2013; Garcia Forero, Carlos/B-4771-2009; Haro, Josep Maria/D-1423-2011; de Girolamo, Giovanni/K-3062-2016; Vilagut, Gemma/N-8718-2014","Ferrer, Montse/0000-0001-9867-7391; Alonso, Jordi/0000-0001-8627-9636; BRUFFAERTS, RONNY/0000-0002-0330-3694; Garcia Forero, Carlos/0000-0002-5245-0076; Matschinger, Herbert/0000-0001-7146-6770; Haro, Josep Maria/0000-0002-3984-277X; de Girolamo, Giovanni/0000-0002-1611-8324; Vilagut, Gemma/0000-0002-3714-226X","Fondo De Investigacion Sanitaria ISCIII [ECA07/059]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion FSE grant [JCI-2009-05486]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III FEDER [PI08/90724]; European Commission [QLG5-1999-01042, SANCO 2004123, EAHC 20081308]; Piedmont Region (Italy); Fondo de Investigacion Sanitaria, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spain [FIS 00/0028-02]; Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Spain [SAF 2000-158-CE]; Departament de Salut, Generalitat de Catalunya, Spain; GlaxoSmithKline","Fondo De Investigacion Sanitaria ISCIII(Instituto de Salud Carlos III); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion FSE grant; Instituto de Salud Carlos III FEDER(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIIEuropean Union (EU)Spanish Government); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Piedmont Region (Italy)(Regione PiemonteInstituto de Salud Carlos III); Fondo de Investigacion Sanitaria, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spain(Instituto de Salud Carlos III); Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Spain(Spanish Government); Departament de Salut, Generalitat de Catalunya, Spain(Generalitat de Catalunya); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline)","Gemma Vilagut was supported by Fondo De Investigacion Sanitaria ISCIII (ECA07/059).

In health economics, ambiguity is usually handled through sensitivity analysis, which implicitly assumes that people are neutral towards ambiguity. However, empirical evidence suggests that people are averse to ambiguity and react strongly to it. This paper studies the effects of ambiguity aversion on two classical medical decision problems. If there is ambiguity regarding the diagnosis of a patient, ambiguity aversion increases the decision maker's propensity to opt for treatment. On the other hand, in the case of ambiguity regarding the effects of treatment, ambiguity aversion leads to a reduction in the propensity to choose treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This requirement could improve health by reducing illegal access to prescription drugs. However, it reduces access to health care by making it more difficult for patients and physicians to use many forms of telemedicine. Thus, this regulation generates a trade-off between access and safety. Using matching techniques, we find that the physician examination requirement leads to an increase of 1% in mortality rates from disease, the equivalent of 8.5 more deaths per 100,000 people, and a decrease of 6.7% in injury mortality, the equivalent of 2.5 deaths per 100,000 people. The magnitude of these effects is larger in rural areas and in areas with low physician density and is accompanied by an 18% increase in the number of days lost each month to illness.

This paper establishes the normative implications of this type of decomposition by embedding it within a broader analysis of changes in the health achievement' index. We further show that the choice of health inequality measure implies a particular vertical equity judgement, which may be expressed on a common scale in terms of the concentration index of health changes that would be inequality preserving. We illustrate the empirical implications of this choice by reporting results from a longitudinal analysis of changes in income-related health inequality in Great Britain using the concentration, the Erreygers and Wagstaff indices of health attainments and the concentration index of health shortfalls.

The model utilized for estimation implies that physicians can choose among 10 different job packages which are a combination of part time/full time, hospital/primary care, private/public sector, and not working. Their current choice is influenced by past available options due to a habit persistence parameter in the utility function. In the estimation we take into account the budget constraint, including all features of the tax system. Our results imply that an overall wage increase or less progressive taxation moves married physicians toward full time job packages, in particular to full time jobs in the private sector. But the overall and aggregate labor supply elasticities in the population of employed doctors are rather low compared to previous estimates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Since the axioms of a total preorder do not usually hold in many applications, preferences are often modeled by means of weaker binary relations, dropping either completeness (e.g. partial preorders) or transitivity (e.g. interval orders and semiorders). We introduce an alternative approach to preference modeling, which uses two binary relations - the necessary preference greater than or similar to(N) and the possible preference greater than or similar to(P) - to fulfill completeness and transitivity in a mixed form. Formally, a NaP-preference (necessary and possible preference) on A is a pair (greater than or similar to(N), greater than or similar to(P)) such that greater than or similar to(N) is a partial preorder on A and greater than or similar to(P) is an extension of greater than or similar to(N) satisfying mixed properties of transitivity and completeness. We characterize a NaP-preference (greater than or similar to(N), greater than or similar to(P)) by the existence of a nonempty set X of total preorders such that boolean AND R = greater than or similar to(N) and boolean OR R = greater than or similar to(P). In order to analyze the representability of Nap-preferences via families of utility functions, we generalize the notion of a multi-utility representation of a partial preorder by that of a modal utility representation of a pair of binary relations. Further, we give a dynamic view of the family of all NaP-preferences on a fixed set A by endowing it with a relation of partial order, which is defined according to the stability of the information represented by each NaP-preference.

This makes it possible to express the fact that an agent knows that there are some facts of which he is unaware. In that logic, it is not possible to model an agent who is uncertain about whether he is aware of all formulas. To overcome this problem, we keep the syntax of the earlier paper, but allow models where, with each world, a possibly different language is associated. We provide a sound and complete axiomatization for this logic and show that, under natural assumptions, the quantifier-free fragment of the logic is characterized by exactly the same axioms as the logic of Heifetz et al, (2008).

Despite a growth in published reports, existing reporting guidelines are not widely adopted. There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user-friendly manner. A checklist is one way to help authors, editors, and peer reviewers use guidelines to improve reporting. Objective: The task force's overall goal was to provide recommendations to optimize the reporting of health economic evaluations. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines into one current, useful reporting guidance. The CHEERS Elaboration and Explanation Report of the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Good Reporting Practices Task Force facilitates the use of the CHEERS statement by providing examples and explanations for each recommendation. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. Methods: The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. Previously published checklists or guidance documents related to reporting economic evaluations were identified from a systematic review and subsequent survey of task force members. A list of possible items from these efforts was created. A two-round, modified Delphi Panel with representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, and government, as well as the editorial community, was used to identify a minimum set of items important for reporting from the larger list. Results: Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed, with some specific recommendations for single study-based and model-based economic evaluations. The final recommendations are subdivided into six main categories: 1) title and abstract, 2) introduction, 3) methods, 4) results, 5) discussion, and 6) other. The recommendations are contained in the CHEERS statement, a user-friendly 24-item checklist. The task force report provides explanation and elaboration, as well as an example for each recommendation. The ISPOR CHEERS statement is available online via Value in Health or the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Good Reporting Practices - CHEERS Task Force webpage (http://www.ispor.orgtraskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp). Conclusions: We hope that the ISPOR CHEERS statement and the accompanying task force report guidance will lead to more consistent and transparent reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate wider dissemination and uptake of this guidance, we are copublishing the CHEERS statement across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups to consider endorsing the CHEERS statement. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in 5 years.","[Husereau, Don] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Carswell, Chris] Adis Int, Pharmacoecon, Auckland, New Zealand; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Greenberg, Dan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Greenberg, Dan] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Augustovski, Federico] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Augustovski, Federico] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Loder, Elizabeth] Faulkner Hosp, Brigham & Womens Faulkner Neurol, Boston, MA USA",University of Ottawa; University of York - UK; University of Warwick; Adis International; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Ben Gurion University; Tufts Medical Center; University of Buenos Aires; University of Glasgow; Research Triangle Institute,"Husereau, D (通讯作者)，879 Winnington Ave, Ottawa, ON K2B 5C4, Canada.",donh@donhusereau.com,"Moher, David/I-3408-2019; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Husereau, Don/AAJ-7722-2021; Curiello, Simona/HGT-7408-2022; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Husereau, Don/0000-0002-4416-6876; Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Carswell, Christopher/0000-0003-0828-0548; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR),International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR),Support for this initiative was provided by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

Methods: This was a retrospective study using Medicaid administrative health care claims from 15 states. Subjects were HIV patients aged 18 to 64 years initiating atazanavir- or darunavir-based ART from January 1, 2003, to July 1, 2010, with continuous enrollment for 6 months before (baseline) and 6 months after (evaluation period) ART initiation and 1 or more evaluation period medical claim. Outcomes were incidence and health care costs of the following medically attended (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification-coded or treated) adverse effects during the evaluation period: gastrointestinal, lipid abnormalities, diabetes/hyperglycemia, rash, and jaundice. All-cause health care costs were also determined. Patients treated with atazanavir and darunavir were propensity score matched (ratio = 3:1) by using demographic and clinical covariates. Multivariable models adjusted for covariates lacking postmatch statistical balance. Results: Propensity-matched study sample included 1848 atazanavir- and 616 darunavir-treated patients (mean age 41 years, 50% women, 69% black). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (for darunavir, reference = atazanavir) and per-patient-per-month health care cost differences (darunavir minus atazanavir) were as follows: gastrointestinal, HR = 1.25 (P = 0.04), $43 (P = 0.13); lipid abnormalities, HR = 1.38 (P = 0.07), $3 (P = 0.88); diabetes/hyperglycemia, HR = 0.84 (P = 0.55), $13 (P = 0.69); and rash, HR = 1.11 (P = 0.23), $0 (P = 0.76); all-cause health care costs were $1086 (P < 0.001). Too few instances of jaundice (11 in atazanavir and 1 in darunavir) occurred to support multivariable modeling. Conclusions: Medication tolerability can be critical to the success or failure of ART. Compared with darunavir-treated patients, atazanavir-treated patients had significantly fewer instances of medically attended gasid-ointestinal issues and more instances of jaundice and incurred significantly lower health care costs.","[Johnston, Stephen S.; Espindle, Derek; Chu, Bong-Chul] Truven Hlth Analyt, Washington, DC USA; [Juday, Timothy; Esker, Stephen; Hebden, Tony; Uy, Jonathan] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Plainsboro, NJ USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Johnston, SS (通讯作者)，4301 Connecticut Ave NW,Suite 330, Washington, DC 20008 USA.",stephen.johnston@truvenhealth.com,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),Bristol-Myers Squibb sponsored this study.,,23,8,9,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16,2.0,,,,,418,425,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.10.021,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538194.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400022,0

We address the self-selection of the residents in their neighborhoods, as well as the possible endogeneity of income with respect to health, through instrumental variable methods and several endogeneity tests. The main novelty is the sound estimation of the neighborhood effect on health using observational data, which has the advantage of providing general results that are not dependent on any experimental design. This allows us to fully compare the neighborhood effect with the traditional socioeconomic determinants of health. Our main findings are that low quality neighborhoods are strongly health damaging. This effect is comparable to the primary/upper secondary education health differential and is even higher than the impact that poor economic circumstances have on health. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Existing literature on nonstationary threshold models has basically focused on models where the nonstationarity can be removed by differencing and/or where the threshold variable is stationary. This is not the case for the process we consider, and nonstandard estimation problems are the result. This paper proposes a parameter estimation method for such nonlinear threshold autoregressive models using the theory of null recurrent Markov chains. Under certain assumptions, we show that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators of the parameters involved are asymptotically consistent. Furthermore, it can be shown that the OLS estimator of the coefficient parameter involved in the stationary regime can still be asymptotically normal while the OLS estimator of the coefficient parameter involved in the nonstationary regime has a nonstandard asymptotic distribution. In the limit, the rate of convergence in the stationary regime is asymptotically proportional to n(-1/4), whereas it is n(-1) in the nonstationary regime. The proposed theory and estimation method are illustrated by both simulated data and a real data example. 0 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We present a new approach for estimating these policy effects that explicitly models the particular policy instrument over which legislators have control-income eligibility thresholds. Our approach circumvents estimation problems stemming from misclassification or measurement error. Moreover, it allows us to assess how the policy effects may vary at different initial threshold levels. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, we find three main results. First, the eligibility expansions result in significant increases in Medicaid participation; a typical expansion increases Medicaid participation by about four percent of baseline coverage rates. Second, the participation effect is larger for lower initial thresholds and the effect decreases as Medicaid thresholds increase. Third, we find no statistically significant evidence of crowd out regardless of initial threshold level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the tests using the standard normal critical values have asymptotically correct size and are consistent against general fixed alternatives. Furthermore, we establish conditions under which the tests have nontrivial local power against Pitman local alternatives. Some results from Monte Carlo simulations are presented.

Methods: We identified three properties that must be satisfied for mappings to be logically coherent: invertability, transitivity, and invariance to linear transformation. Of the common regressions, ordinary least squares (OLS), geometric mean (GM), and orthogonal regression, only GM has all these properties, and then only in special cases, We developed a common factor model of how DSM and generic QOL scales are related, and derived expressions for coherent mapping coefficients. We showed that these are equivalent to adjusted forms of OLS or GM regressions. Where cohort data are available on just one DSM and one QOL measure, external data on the reproducibility of the DSM are required. In some circumstances, the mappings can be estimated without external data. We illustrated the estimation of mapping coefficients by using data on EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire, 12-item short form health survey (SF-12) Mental Component Summary, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), from a trial of treatments for depression. Results: OLS underestimates and GM overestimates mappings from DSMs to generic QOL measures. Mappings estimated by using external data on reliability were similar to those estimated by using internal data, suggesting approximate adequacy of the common factor model. Conclusions: Neither OLS nor GM regression, unless corrected, is suitable for estimating mappings between disease-specific and generic QOL scales. OLS systematically underestimates mappings, but it can be adjusted by using external information on test-retest reliability.","[Lu, Guobing; Ades, A.

X-t*} when only {W-t} is observed. In structural dynamic models, W-t includes the choice variables and observed state variables of an optimizing agent, while X-t* denotes.time-varying serially correlated unobserved state variables (or agent-specific unobserved heterogeneity). In the non-stationary case, we show that the Markov law of motion f(Wt,Xt*vertical bar Wt-1,Xt-1*), is identified from five periods of data Wt+1, W-t, Wt-1, Wt-2, Wt-3. In the stationary case. only four observations Wt+1, W-t, Wt-1, Wt-2 are required. Identification of f(Wt,Xt*vertical bar Wt-1,Xt-1*) is a crucial input in methodologies for estimating Markovian dynamic models based on the conditional-choice-probability (CCP) approach pioneered by Hotz and Miller.

With the use of Korean data for the elderly, this paper estimates the effects of informal family health care on formal health care, where the former is measured by the number of caregivers and the latter is measured by the formal health care expenditure. This task, however, poses a number of difficulties. The first is that the number of the family caregivers is an endogenous count regressor. The second is that there are too many zeros in the count (85%). The third is that the response variable also has a nontrivial proportion of zeros (14%). This paper overcomes these problems by combining control function approach, zero-inflated counts, and a semiparametric estimator for censored models. The resulting procedure avoids strong parametric assumptions and behaves well computationally. Our main empirical finding is that informal family health care has a large substitute effect for diabetics and that there are also weak evidences that informal family health care has substitute effects for high blood pressure and mental diseases.

We estimate the patient response to a price change for specialty care, based on a co-payment increase from $15 to $50 per visit for veterans with hypertension. Design, Setting, and Patients A retrospective cohort of veterans required to pay co-payments was compared with veterans exempt from co-payments whose nonequivalence was reduced via propensity score matching. Specialty care expenditures in 20002003 were estimated via a two-part mixed model to account for the correlation of the use and level outcomes over time, and results from this correlated two-part model were compared with an uncorrelated two-part model and a correlated random intercept two-part mixed model. Results A $35 specialty visit co-payment increase had no impact on the likelihood of seeking specialty care but induced lower specialty expenditures over time among users who were required to pay co-payments. The log ratio of price responsiveness (semi-elasticity) for specialty care increased from -0.25 to -0.31 after the co-payment increase. Estimates were similar across the three models. Conclusion A significant increase in specialty visit co-payments reduced specialty expenditures among patients obtaining medications at the Veterans Affairs medical centers. Longitudinal expenditure analysis may be improved using recent advances in two-part model methods. Published 2011.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. The sample contained 777 smokers (willingness to quit using a WTP of >0) who had responded to the 2009 Global Adult Tobacco Survey conducted in Mexico. Statistical associations and descriptive analyses were conducted to describe smokers and their WTP by using tobacco-related environmental, socioeconomic, and demographic variables. Results: Overall, 74.4% of the smokers were men and 51.4% were daily smokers. On average, the smokers had been consuming tobacco for more than 15 years, 58.6% had made cessation attempts in the past, and around 10.0% knew about the existence of centers to aid in smoking cessation. The average WTP for an effective cessation method was US $191. Among men, the WTP was US $152 lower than among women. In all the estimated models, the higher an individual's education and socioeconomic level, the higher his or her WTP. Conclusions: This study suggests that Mexican smokers interested in quitting smoking attribute a high monetary value to an effective cessation method. Male smokers demonstrated less altruistic behavior than did female smokers. Mexico requires the implementation of more policies designed to support smoking cessation and to limit tobacco addiction. Expanding the availability of cessation programs and access to pharmacological treatments may contribute to reaching universal coverage by integrating new pharmacological alternatives into the health sector's medicine formulary.","[Servan-Mori, Edson; Bautista-Arredondo, Sergio] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Evaluat Res & Surveys, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico; [Heredia-Pi, Ileana B.] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Syst Res, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico; [Myriam Reynales-Shigematsu, Luz] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Populat Hlth Res, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico",Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica; Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica; Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica,"Bautista-Arredondo, S (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Evaluat Res & Surveys, Ave Univ 655, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico.",sbautista@insp.mx,"Bautista-Arredondo, Sergio/N-7305-2016; Heredia-Pi, Ileana Beatriz/L-4247-2019","Bautista-Arredondo, Sergio/0000-0001-8910-3011; Heredia-Pi, Ileana Beatriz/0000-0002-9998-9239; Servan-Mori, Edson/0000-0001-9820-8325; Reynales - Shigematsu, Luz Myriam/0000-0002-5350-0928","Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use, a program of Bloomberg Philanthropies","Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use, a program of Bloomberg Philanthropies","Funds for the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) were provided by the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use, a program of Bloomberg Philanthropies.

The Wald-type test, S, which has a null distribution that is asymptotically chi-squared, is shown to be generally invariant with respect to the ordering of the models being compared. Finite-sample corrections for the test are also developed. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that S has reasonable size properties in large samples but tends to be oversized in moderate samples. The finite-sample correction succeeds in correcting for size, but only partially. For the size-adjusted tests, power increases with sample size, as expected. It is speculated that further finite-sample improvements can be achieved using Hotelling's T-2 or bootstrap critical values. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This makes explicit inequity that derives from unequal treatment response to variation in need, as well as that due to differential effects of non-need determinants. Under plausible conditions concerning heterogeneity in the use-need relationship and the distribution of need, existing methods that impose homogeneity will underestimate pro-rich inequity. This prediction is confirmed for four middle-income Asian countries. In those countries, around one half of the observed socioeconomic inequality is due to utilisation being more responsive to need among the higher wealth and urban dwelling individuals.

In this article, we test whether media attention is affecting donors' disbursement of aid for HIV to African countries. We use information available on the number of articles and press documents on HIV issues and other health concerns published in donor countries to construct a proxy of media coverage. This proxy is then included as an explanatory variable in a regression of aid for HIV to Africa. After controlling for several donor characteristics, we find that greater media coverage increases aid disbursement. This may be good news for the HIV campaign but may result in displacement effects to the extent that other diseases that cause greater mortality and morbidity receive less media coverage than HIV and thus less health aid.

In CEA that use non-randomized studies (NRS), the selection on observables assumption must hold for regression and matching methods to be unbiased. Even in restricted circumstances when this assumption is plausible, a key concern is how to adjust for imbalances in observed confounders. If the propensity score is misspecified, the covariates in the matched sample will be imbalanced, which can lead to conditional bias. To address covariate imbalance in CEA based on RCTs and NRS, this paper considers Genetic Matching. This matching method uses a search algorithm to directly maximize covariate balance. We compare Genetic and propensity score matching in Monte Carlo simulations and two case studies, CEA of pulmonary artery catheterization, based on an RCT and an NRS. The simulations show that Genetic Matching reduces the conditional bias and root mean squared error compared with propensity score matching. Genetic Matching achieves better covariate balance than the unadjusted analyses of the RCT data. In the NRS, Genetic Matching improves on the balance obtained from propensity score matching and gives substantively different estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness. We conclude that Genetic Matching can improve balance on measured covariates in CEA that use RCTs and NRS, but with NRS, this will be insufficient to reduce bias; the selection on observables assumption must also hold.

These results can then be applied to studies that have used FACT-G or FACT-C to predict SF-6D utility values to inform economic evaluation. Methods: Ordinary least square regressions were estimated mapping FACT-G and FACT-C onto SF-6D by using cross-sectional data of 537 Chinese subjects with different stages of colorectal neoplasm. Mapping functions for SF-6D preference-based values were developed separately for FACT-G and FACT-C in four sequential models for addition of variables: 1) main-effect terms, 2) squared terms, 3) interaction terms, and 4) clinical and demographic variables. Predictive performance in each model was assessed by the R-2, adjusted R-2, predicted R-2, information criteria (Akaike information criteria and Bayesian information criteria), the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, and the proportions of absolute error within the threshold of 0.05 and 0.10. Results: Models including FACT variables and clinical and demographic variables had the best predictive performance measured by using R-2 (FACT-G: 59.98%; FACT-C: 60.43%), root mean square error (FACT-G: 0.086; FACT-C: 0.084), and mean absolute error (FACT-G: 0.065; FACT-C: 0.065). The FACT-C-based mapping function had better predictive ability than did the FACT-G-based mapping function. Conclusions: Models mapping FACT-G and FACT-C onto SF-6D reached an acceptable degree of precision. Mapping from the condition- specific measure (FACT-C) had better performance than did mapping from the general cancer measure (FACT-G). These mapping functions can be applied to FACT-G or FACT-C data sets to estimate SF-6D utility values for economic evaluation of medical interventions for patients with colorectal neoplasm. Further research assessing model performance in independent data sets and non-Chinese populations are encouraged.","[Wong, Carlos K.

While the hypothesis of lock-in plays an important role in the antitrust policy debate for the operating systems market, it has not been extensively documented empirically. To account for unobserved preferences, we use a panel data identification approach based on time-variant group fixed effects, and estimate the dynamic discrete choice panel data model developed by Arellano and Carrasco (2003). Using detailed establishment-level data, we find that once we account for unobserved preferences, the estimated magnitudes of lock-in are considerably smaller than those from the conventional approaches, suggesting that unobserved preferences play a major role in the persistence of Windows. Further robustness checks are consistent with our findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The setup allows heteroskedasticity and threshold effects in both mean and variance. By interpreting the threshold point as a middle boundary of the threshold variable, we find that the Bayes estimator is asymptotically efficient among all estimators in the locally asymptotically minimax sense. In particular, the Bayes estimator of the threshold point is asymptotically strictly more efficient than the left-endpoint maximum likelihood estimator and the newly proposed middle-point maximum likelihood estimator. Algorithms are developed to calculate asymptotic distributions and risk for the estimators of the threshold point. The posterior interval is proved to be an asymptotically valid confidence interval and is attractive in both length and coverage in finite samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the context of latent variable models, an additional problem with BFs is that they are difficult to compute. In this paper, a new Bayesian method, based on the decision theory and the EM algorithm, is introduced to test a point hypothesis in latent variable models. The new statistic is a by-product of the Bayesian MCMC output and, hence, easy to compute. It is shown that the new statistic is appropriately defined under improper priors because the method employs a continuous loss function. In addition, it is easy to interpret. The method is illustrated using a one-factor asset pricing model and a stochastic volatility model with jumps. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Consenting patients undergoing total knee replacement were interviewed to determine their HRQOL by using the six-dimensional health state short form, derived from SF-36, and the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire at baseline (pretest 1) and the six-dimensional health state short form, derived from SF-36, at 6 (pretest 2) and 18 months after surgery (post-test). RS was studied by using a then-test approach by contacting participants 18 months after surgery and asking them to evaluate their HRQOL at baseline (then-test 1) and at 6 (then-test 2) and 18 months after surgery. RS was calculated as the score difference between pretest and then-test scores for a given time point. Relationships between RS and external variables were explored by using univariate and multiple liner regression analyses. Results: In 74 subjects (63% response rate, median age 68 years), median (interquantile range) six-dimensional health state short form, derived from SF-36, scores for then-tests at baseline (0.48 [0.42-0.49]) and at 6 months (0.72 [0.66-0.79]) after surgery were significantly different from respective pretest scores (0.61 [0.58-0.68] at baseline, P = 0.000; 0.69 [0.63-0.72] at 6 months, P = 0.000), showing RS at both time points. RS at baseline (0.14 [0.08-0.20]) was significantly larger than that at 6 months (-0.05 [0.14 to 0.00], P = 0.000). EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire pretest and then-test scores at baseline also differed significantly (0.69 [0.17-0.73] vs. -0.18 [-0.23 to 0.00], P = 0.000). RS at baseline was not affected by assessed demographic or medical variables.

Conclusion: RS was present and impacted HRQOL and utility assessment among patients undergoing total knee replacement before and 6 months after surgery.","[Fong, Kok-Yong; Thumboo, Julian] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Singapore 169608, Singapore; [Fong, Kok-Yong; Thumboo, Julian] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Dept Med, Singapore 117595, Singapore; [Zhang, Xu-Hao] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Pharm, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Li, Shu-Chuen] Univ Newcastle, Sch Biomed Sci, Discipline Pharm & Expt Pharmacol, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia; [Xie, Feng] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Lo, Ngai-Nung; Yang, Kwang-Ying; Yeo, Seng-Jin] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Singapore 169608, Singapore",Singapore General Hospital; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; University of Newcastle; McMaster University; Singapore General Hospital,"Thumboo, J (通讯作者)，Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Outram Rd, Singapore 169608, Singapore.",julian.thumboo@sgh.com.sg,"LI, SHU CHUEN/G-7911-2013",,National University of Singapore,National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore),Funding for this study was provided by the National University of Singapore.

These payout events can be interpreted as managerial signals of firm financial life-cycle maturation resulting in concomitant changes in firm risks. We remove confounding payout types and we match on the propensity to initiate or omit informed by determinants of payout known to investors in advance. For payout event and matched firms, we apply the difference-in-differences method to estimate the effect of the information content of actual initiations and omissions on firm risks. We find consistent significant declines in total, aggregate systematic, and idiosyncratic firm risks after cash dividend initiations and increases after dividend omissions, but only incidentally after share repurchase initiations and omissions.

We first show that under some regularity conditions regarding the learning function, the model has (a) one steady state, (b) no steady states or (c) two steady states (one saddle and one non-saddle). Moreover, via the Bogdanov-Takens theorem, we prove that for critical regions of the parameters space, the dynamics undergoes a particular global phenomenon, namely the homoclinic bifurcation. Because these findings imply the existence of a continuum of equilibrium trajectories, all departing from the same initial value of the predetermined variable, the model exhibits global indeterminacy.

J,"Munnich, EL",,,,"Munnich, Elizabeth L.",,,THE LABOR MARKET EFFECTS OF CALIFORNIA'S MINIMUM NURSE STAFFING LAW,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,hospitals; nurse staffing,MANDATE,"In 2004, California became the first state to implement statewide minimum nurse-to-patient ratios in general hospitals. In spite of years of work to establish statewide staffing regulations, there is little evidence that the law was effective in attracting more nurses to the hospital workforce or improving patient outcomes. This paper examines the effects of this legislation on employment and wages of registered nurses. By using annual financial data from California hospitals, I show that nurse-to-patient ratios in medical/surgical units increased substantially following the staffing mandate. However, survey data from two nationally representative datasets indicate that the law had no effect on the aggregate number of registered nurses or the hours they worked in California hospitals, and at most a modest effect on wages. My findings suggest that offsetting changes in labor demand due to hospital closures, combined with reclassification of workers within hospitals, and mitigated the employment effects of California's staffing regulation. This paper cautions that California's experience with minimum nurse staffing legislation may not be generalizable to states considering similar policies in very different hospital markets.

We show that if consumers' signals in the model are moderately heavy-tailed and the firms use the sample mean of the signals to estimate the ideal product, then the firms' output levels exhibit positive persistence. In such a setting, large firms have an advantage over their smaller counterparts. These properties are reversed for signals with extremely heavy-tailed distributions. In such a case, the model implies anti-persistence in output levels, together with a surprising pattern of oscillations in firm sizes, with smaller firms being likely to become larger ones next period, and vice versa. We further show that the implications of the model under moderate heavy-tailedness continue to hold under the only assumption of symmetry of consumers' signals if the firms use a more robust estimator of the ideal product, the sample median.

The concept of fatigue is multidimensional and includes both physical and mental components. The 22-item Revised Piper Fatigue Scale (RN'S) is a multidimensional instrument developed to assess cancer related fatigue. This study reports on the construct validity of the Swedish version of the RPFS from the perspective of Rasch measurement. Methods: The Swedish version of the RPFS was answered by 196 cancer patients fatigued after 4 to 5 weeks of curative radiation therapy. Data from the scale were fitted to the Rasch measurement model. This involved testing a series of assumptions, including the stochastic ordering of items, local response dependency, and unidimensionality. A series of fit statistics were computed, differential item functioning (DIF) was tested, and local response dependency was accommodated through testlets. Results: The Behavioral, Affective and Sensory domains all satisfied the Rasch model expectations. No DIE was observed, and all domains were found to be unidimensional. The Mood/Cognitive scale failed to fit the model, and substantial multidimensionality was found. Splitting the scale between Mood and Cognitive items resolved fit to the Rasch model, and new domains were unidimensional without DIF. Conclusions: The current Rasch analyses add to the evidence of measurement properties of the scale and show that the RPFS has good psychometric properties and works well to measure fatigue. The original four-factor structure, however, was not supported.","[Lundgren-Nilsson, Asa; Dencker, Anna; Jakobsson, Sofie; Taft, Charles; Tennant, Alan] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Hlth & Care Sci, Ctr Person Ctr Care, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lundgren-Nilsson, Asa] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Neurosci & Physiol, Dept Clin Neurosci & Rehabil, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tennant, Alan] Univ Leeds, Acad Dept Rehabil Med, Fac Med & Hlth, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg; University of Leeds,"Dencker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Hlth & Care Sci, Ctr Person Ctr Care, Gothenburg, Sweden.",anna.dencker@gu.se,"Jakobsson, Sofie/IQV-0856-2023","Jakobsson, Sofie/0000-0001-5223-6363; Tennant, Alan/0000-0002-0728-2130; Taft, Charles/0000-0001-8709-4270",,,,,34,9,10,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,360,363,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.02.010,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24968995.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900008,0

Each player's process continues as long as she exerts costly effort. The player who collects the most breakthroughs until a predetermined deadline wins a prize. We derive Nash equilibria of the game depending on the deadline. For short deadlines, there is a unique equilibrium in which players use identical cutoff strategies, i.e., they continue until they have a certain number of successes. If the deadline is long enough, the symmetric equilibrium distribution of an all-pay auction is an equilibrium distribution over successes in the contest. Expected efforts may be maximal for a short or intermediate deadline. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our contribution differs from most of the literature in two respects. First, background risk does not need to be additive or multiplicative. Second, the two risks are not necessarily mean independent, and may be conditional expectation increasing or decreasing. We show that our order of cross Ross risk aversion is equivalent to the order of partial risk premium, while our index of decreasing cross Ross risk aversion is equivalent to decreasing partial risk premium. These results generalize the comparative risk aversion model developed by Ross for mean independent risks. Our theoretical results are related to utility functions having the n-switch independence property. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

They argue that the set of incomplete-information models with common priors that satisfy this so-called BDP property (beliefs determine preferences) is negligible. In contrast, we show that, in models with finite-dimensional abstract type spaces, the set of belief functions with this property is topologically generic in the set of all belief functions.

All-pay auctions are often used to model competition with irreversible investments such as political lobbying, and in the existing models, the equilibrium outcomes are quite different from the winner-pay auctions (under complete information): The unique equilibrium is in non-degenerate mixed strategies in the sealed-bid all-pay auction, and the highest value bidder wins at (virtually) no cost in the dollar auction. In sharp contrast with those existing models, the equilibrium outcome in the present setting is almost identical to the winner-pay auctions. That is, (a) the highest value bidder wins with probability one, and (b) the revenue of the seller is equal to the second highest value among the bidders. Also, from a mechanism-design point of view, the present game form is more robust than other all-pay mechanisms in that the seller does not need any information about the bidders' valuations. Although the analysis focuses on the two-bidder two-stage case, the results extend to arbitrary numbers of bidders and stages. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Cavaliere, G; Xu, F",,,,"Cavaliere, Giuseppe; Xu, Fang",,,Testing for unit roots in bounded time series,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NONSTATIONARY VOLATILITY; MODELS; COINTEGRATION; BOOTSTRAP; SELECTION; LAG,"Many key economic and financial series are bounded either by construction or through policy controls. Conventional unit root tests are potentially unreliable in the presence of bounds, since they tend to over-reject the null hypothesis of a unit root, even asymptotically. So far, very little work has been undertaken to develop unit root tests which can be applied to bounded time series. In this paper we address this gap in the literature by proposing unit root tests which are valid in the presence of bounds. We present new augmented Dickey-Fuller type tests as well as new versions of the modified 'M' tests developed by Ng and Perron [Ng, S., Perron, P., 2001. LAG length selection and the construction of unit root tests with good size and power.

Methods: Four methods of estimation have been identified: 1) summing all health care expenditures, 2) estimating disease specific expenditures consistent with an attribution approach, 3) estimating disease-specific expenditures by matching, and 4) estimating disease-specific expenditures by using a regression based approach. A literature review of studies (2005-2012) that used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was undertaken to establish the most popular expenditure estimation methods. These methods were then applied to a sample of 120 respondents with HNC, derived from pooled data (2003-2008). Results: The literature review shows that varying expenditure estimation methods have been used with MEPS but no study compared and contrasted all four methods. Our estimates are reflective of the national treated prevalence of HNC. The upper-bound estimate of annual direct medical expenditures of adult respondents with HNC between 2003 and 2008 was $3.18 billion (in 2008 dollars). Comparable estimates arising from methods focusing on disease specific and incremental expenditures were all lower in magnitude. Attribution yielded annual expenditures of $1.41 billion, matching method of $1.56 billion, and regression method of $1.09 billion. Conclusions: This research demonstrates that variation exists across and within expenditure estimation methods applied to MEPS data Despite concerns regarding aspects of reliability and consistency, reporting a combination of the four methods offers a degree of transparency and validity to estimating the likely range of annual direct medical expenditures of a condition.","[Coughlan, Diarmuid; O'Neill, Ciaran] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Econ Canc Res Grp, Galway, Ireland; [Yeh, Susan T.; Frick, Kevin D.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Baltimore, MD USA",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Coughlan, D (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, St Marys Bldg,Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",diarmuidcoughlan@gmail.com,,"Coughlan, Diarmuid/0000-0002-5348-3750; Yeh, Susan/0000-0001-9916-7799; Frick, Kevin/0000-0002-0178-5319",National Cancer Institute,National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),Diarmuid Coughlan is funded as a research fellow of the Health Research Board in Ireland in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute.,,72,31,32,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN,2014,17,1.0,,,,,90,97,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.10.004,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,291RS,24438722.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329847500013,0

We initially consider the unconditional moment restrictions framework. Optimal m-tests against moment condition parameter heterogeneity are derived with the relevant Jacobian matrix obtained in terms of the second order own derivatives of the moment indicator in a leading case. GMM and GEL tests of specification based on generalized information matrix equalities appropriate for moment-based models are described and their relation to optimal m-tests against moment condition parameter heterogeneity examined. A fundamental and important difference is noted between GMM and GEL constructions. The paper is concluded by a generalization of these tests to the conditional moment context and the provision of a limited set of simulation experiments to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed tests.

We investigate the relationship between participation in physical activity and health using a bivariate probit model. Participation is identified with an exclusion restriction on a variable reflecting sense of belonging to the community. Estimates based on data from Cycle 3.1 of the Canadian Community Health Survey indicate that participation in physical activity reduces the reported incidence of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, and arthritis as well as being in fair or poor health. Increasing the intensity above the moderate level and frequency of participation in physical activity appears to have a diminishing marginal impact on adverse health outcomes.

However, the question remains open as to whether an equilibrium's individual state space might turn out to be such that: either (i) every agent's common borrowing constraint binds forever, and so the distribution of agents will be degenerate; or (ii) the individual state space might be unbounded. By invoking a simple comparative-statics argument, we provide closure to this open question. We show that the equilibrium individual state space must be compact and that this set has positive measure. From Huggett's result that there is a unique distribution of agents in a stationary equilibrium, our result implies that it must also be one that is nontrivial or nondegenerate.

The intermediation core allocations are closely related to the equilibrium allocations of a non-cooperative intermediation game in Townsend (1983). We show that the intermediation core contains all subgame perfect equilibrium allocations of the intermediation game, similar to the inclusion of competitive equilibrium allocations in the core usually studied. We identify intermediation core allocations that are also subgame perfect equilibrium allocations of the intermediation game in terms of the supporting intermediary structures. These results help to characterize subgame perfect equilibrium allocations of the intermediation game and to analyze their welfare and stability properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Second, it avoids Jeffreys-Lindley's paradox, Third, it is easy to compute and its threshold value is easily derived, facilitating the implementation in practice. The method is illustrated using some real examples in economics and finance.

We review the limited number of previous studies and critique the frameworks adopted and the narrow range of costs and outcomes considered, before proposing a new more comprehensive framework, which we apply to the first P4P scheme introduced for hospitals in England. We emphasise that evaluations of cost-effectiveness need to consider who the residual claimant is on any cost savings, the possibility of positive and negative spillovers, and whether performance improvement is a transitory or investment activity. Our application to the Advancing Quality initiative demonstrates that the incentive payments represented less than half of the 13m pound total programme costs. By generating approximately 5200 quality-adjusted life years and 4.4m pound of savings in reduced length of stay, we find that the programme was a cost-effective use of resources in its first 18months.

Our basic premise is that a decrease in the number of coalitions of voters that exist with similar preference rankings should generally lead to a reduced propensity of voting rules to yield undesired results. Surprisingly enough, conclusions that are reported by Felsenthal et al. ( 1990) in an early study do not corroborate this intuition. This study reconsiders and extends the Felsenthal et al. analysis by using a modified Impartial Anonymous Culture (IAC) model. It turns out that the results obtained with this probabilistic assumption are much more consistent with the stated intuitive premise. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The estimators utilize the additive structure of the first-differenced model the fact that the two additive components have the same functional form, and the unknown function of interest is implicitly defined as a solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. We establish the uniform consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators. We also propose a consistent test for the correct specification of linearity in typical dynamic panel data models based on the L-2 distance of our nonparametric estimates and the parametric estimates under the linear restriction. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and a sequence of Pitman local alternatives, and prove its consistency against global alternatives. Simulations suggest that the proposed estimators and tests perform well for finite samples. We apply our new method to study the relationships among economic growth, the initial economic condition and capital accumulation, and find a significant nonlinear relation between economic growth and the initial economic condition.

I also analyse education differences in mammography decisions and examine the underlying mechanisms by which education influences breast cancer screening attendance. I estimate a structural model, which reveals that although there are differences in the disutility of breast cancer screening between education groups, there is no difference in the estimated discount factor. These results suggest that the observed education gradient is mainly due to differences in health behaviours and healthcare attitudes.

We empirically assessed treatment dynamics of newly marked drugs and their implications for conducting CE research. Methods: We used claims data to evaluate five drug-outcome pairs: 1) raloxifene (vs. alendronate) and fracture; 2) risedronate (vs alendronate) and fracture; 3) simvastatin plus ezetimibe fixed-dose combination (simvastatin ezetimibe) (vs. simvastatin alone) and cardiovascular events; 4) rofecoxib (vs nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [ns-NSAIDs]) and myocardial infarction; and 5) rofecoxib (vs ns-NSAIDS) and gastrointestinal bleed. We examined utilization dynamics in the early marketing period, including evolving utilization patterns, outcome risk among those treated with new versus established drugs, and prior treatment patterns that may indicate treatment resistance or intolerance. We addressed these challenges by replicating active CE monitoring with sequential matched cohort analysis. Results: Patients initiating new drugs were more likely to have used other drugs for the same indication in the past, but the majority of patients in all new drug cohorts were treatment naive (82.0% overall). Patients initiating rofecoxib had higher predicted baseline risk of gastrointestinal bleed than did patients initiating ns-NSAIDs. Patients initiating risedronate and alendronate had similar predicted baseline risks of fracture, while those initiating raloxifene and simvastatin ezetimibe had lower risks of outcomes of interest relative to their comparators. Prospective monitoring yielded results consistent with expectation for each example. Conclusions: Many challenges to assessing the CE of new drugs are borne out in empirical data. Attention to these challenges can yield valid CE results.","[Gagne, Joshua J.; Bykov, Katsiaryna; Schneeweiss, Sebastian] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02120 USA; [Gagne, Joshua J.; Bykov, Katsiaryna; Schneeweiss, Sebastian] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02120 USA; [Willke, Richard J.] Pfizer Inc, Ctr Hlth Econ Epidemiol & HTA Global Market Acces, Primary Care Business Unit, New York, NY USA; [Kahler, Kristijan H.] Novartis Pharmaceut, Outcomes Res Methods & Analyt, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Subedi, Prasun] Pfizer Inc, Worldwide Policy, New York, NY USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Pfizer; Novartis; Pfizer,"Gagne, JJ (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Dept Med, 1620 Tremont St,Suite 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",jgagne1@partners.org,"Schneeweiss, Sebastian/C-2125-2013; Bykov, Katsiaryna/JRZ-1072-2023","Schneeweiss, Sebastian/0000-0003-2575-467X; Bykov, Katsiaryna/0000-0003-3336-5412","Pfizer, Inc","Pfizer, Inc(Pfizer)","Source of financial support: This work was funded by an unrestricted grant from Pfizer, Inc.

Methods: A Markov model comparing TOLAC with elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) was developed for a hypothetical cohort with no contraindication to a TOLAC. Women were selected from a prospective study to derive probability estimates for potential events through three subsequent pregnancies. Probabilities for cerebral palsy and stress urinary incontinence, cost data, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained from the literature. The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness measured as the marginal cost per QALY gained, with a $50,000 threshold per QALY used to define cost-effectiveness. Results: The TOLAC strategy dominated the ERCD strategy at baseline, with $164.2 million saved and 500 QALYs gained per 100,000 women. The model was sensitive to six variables: the probability of uterine rupture and successful TOLAC among women with no prior vaginal delivery, the frequency of stress urinary incontinence, and the costs of failed TOLAC, successful TOLAC, and ERCD. When the probability of TOLAC success was at the base value, 67.2%, TOLAC was preferred if the probability of uterine rupture was 3.1% or less. When the probability of uterine rupture was at the base value, 0.8%, the TOLAC strategy was preferred as long as the probability of success was 47.2% or more. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the base-case analysis. Conclusions: Under baseline circumstances, TOLAC is less expensive and more effective than an ERCD when considering long-term consequences when the likelihood of success is 47.2% or more.","[Gilbert, Sharon A.] George Washington Univ, Ctr Biostat, Washington, DC USA; [Grobman, William A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Obstet, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Grobman, William A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Gynecol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Landon, Mark B.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Varner, Michael W.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Wapner, Ronald J.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Sorokin, Yoram] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI USA; [Sibai, Baha M.] Univ Tennessee, Memphis, TN USA; [Thorp, John M.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Ramin, Susan M.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mercer, Brian M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, MetroHlth Med Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",George Washington University; Northwestern University; Northwestern University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Jefferson University; Wayne State University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; MetroHealth System; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Gilbert, SA (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, 6110 Execut Blvd,Suite 750, Rockville, MD 20852 USA.",sgilbert@bsc.gwu.edu,"; Varner, Michael/K-9890-2013","Wapner, Ronald/0000-0003-0727-1244; Varner, Michael/0000-0001-9455-3973","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [HD21410, HD21414, HD27860, HD27861, HD27869, HD27905, HD27915, HD27917, HD34116, HD34122, HD34136, HD34208, HD34210, HD40500, HD40485, HD40544, HD40545, HD40560, HD40512, HD36801]",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Source of financial support: None of the authors has a conflict of interest The project described was supported by grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (HD21410, HD21414, HD27860, HD27861, HD27869, HD27905, HD27915, HD27917, HD34116, HD34122, HD34136, HD34208, HD34210, HD40500, HD40485, HD40544, HD40545, HD40560, HD40512, and HD36801), and its contents are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official view of NICHD or the NIH.",,37,23,32,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,953,964,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.014,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041345.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700006,0

In this paper, we propose an adaptively combined forecasting method for such discrete response data. We demonstrate in theory that the proposed forecast is of the desired adaptation with respect to the widely used squared risk and other significant risk functions under mild conditions. Furthermore, we study the issue of adaptation for the proposed forecasting method in the presence of model screening that is often useful in applications.

(1993), based on additive and multiplicative decompositions of the variance. They allow the variance of the model to have a smooth time-varying structure. The suggested parameterizations describe structural change in the conditional and unconditional variances where the transition between regimes over time is smooth. The main focus is on the multiplicative decomposition of the variance into an unconditional and conditional components. Estimation of the multiplicative model is discussed in detail. An empirical application to daily stock returns illustrates the functioning of the model. The results show that the 'long memory type behaviour' of the sample autocorrelation functions of the absolute returns can also be explained by deterministic changes in the unconditional variance.

It also assesses the role of the international response in the context of this economic impact. For tourism, losing almost a million overseas visitors translated into losses of around $US2.8bn, which extended over a five-month period, mostly because of the slow return of European travellers. For the pork industry, temporal decreases in output were observed in most of the country and related to H1N1 incidence (p=0.048, r=0.37). By the end of 2009, Mexico had a pork trade deficit of $US27m. The losses derived from this pandemic were clearly influenced by the risk perception created in tourist-supplying and pork trade partners. Results suggest that the wider economic implications of health-related emergencies can be significant and need to be considered in preparedness planning. For instance, more effective surveillance and data gathering would enable policy to target emergency funding to the sectors and regions hardest hit. These results also stress the importance of being familiar with trade networks so as to be able to anticipate the international response and respond accordingly.

An alternative is to treat suitable patients at home instead of in the hospital. This article reports on the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of early assisted discharge in The Netherlands. Methods: In the multicenter randomized controlled Assessment of GOing Home under Early Assisted Discharge trial (n = 139), one group received 7 days of inpatient hospital treatment (HOSP) and one group was discharged after 3 days and treated at home by community nurses for 4 days. Health care resource use, productivity losses, and informal care were recorded in cost questionnaires. Microcosting was performed for inpatient day costs. Results: Seven days after admission, mean change from baseline Clinical Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Questionnaire score was better for HOSP, but not statistically significantly: 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.04 to 0.61). The difference in the probability of having a clinically relevant improvement was significant in favor of HOSP: 19.0%-point (95% CI 0.5%-36.3%). After 3 months of follow-up, differences in effectiveness had almost disappeared. The difference in quality-adjusted life-years was 0.0054 (95% CI -0.021 to 0.0095). From a health care perspective, early assisted discharge was cost saving: -(sic)244 (treatment phase, 95% CI -(sic)315 to -(sic)168) and -(sic)168 (3 months, 95% CI -(sic)1253 to 922). Societal perspective: -(sic)65 (treatment phase, 95% CI -(sic)152 to 25) and 908 (3 months, 95% CI -(sic)553 to 2296). The savings per quality-adjusted life-year lost were 31,111 from a health care perspective. From a societal perspective, HOSP was dominant. Conclusions: No clear evidence was found to conclude that either treatment was more effective or less costly.","[Goossens, Lucas M. A.; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P. M.

Of particular interest is high medical care use because a few high users account for a disproportionate amount of use while many individuals use no medical care in a given year. If health is a primary driver of medical care demand, and we control for health, then past medical care use should be uninformative for future use. However, we find that conditional on health, other covariates and unobservable heterogeneity, medical care use remains significantly persistent. No use and high use are more strongly persistent, and persistence is generally stronger for women, those in poor health, and at older ages. We find that unobservable heterogeneity explains between 10% and 25% of the variation in medical care use. This heterogeneity is significantly correlated with both medical care use and health over our long panel. These findings have implications for the econometric modeling of medical care demand and suggest that policies aimed to reduce aggregate medical care spending by improving health, particularly the health of seniors, may be less effective than projected using static models.

This is a common problem in many disciplines including economics. In the context of a prespecified utility (or cost) function we examine the construction of forecasts suggesting an extension of the Manski (1975, 1985) maximum score approach. We provide analytical properties of the method and compare it to more common approaches such as forecasts or classifications based on conditional probability models. Large gains over existing methods can be attained when models are misspecified. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Analyses were conducted for 2505 patients from the Adelphi Overactive Bladder Disease Specific Programme, a cross-sectional study of patients with idiopathic or neurogenic OAB, undertaken in the United States and Europe in 2010. A range of statistical modeling techniques was used. Tenfold cross-validation techniques were used to calculate mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) goodness-of-fit statistics. Various predictor lists, together with a method combining stepwise selection with multivariable fractional polynomial techniques to allow nonlinear relationships to feature, were pursued. Results: Choice of predictors was consistent for both the UK and US EQ-5D questionnaire tariffs. For idiopathic, the best model included the I-QOL total score and age (both modeled nonlinearly.) For neurogenic, the best model was the I-QOL social embarrassment domain score modeled linearly only. Best-fit results were better in the idiopathic (n = 2351; MAE = 0.10; RMSE = 0.14) than in the neurogenic sample (n = 254; MAE = 0.17; RMSE = 0.22). Conclusions: This research provides algorithms for mapping EQ-5D questionnaire index scores from the I-QOL, allowing calculation of appropriate preference-based health-related quality-of-life scores for use in cost-effectiveness analyses when only I-QOL data are available. The strongest results were for idiopathic patients, but those for neurogenic are consistent with those of other published mapping studies.","[Kay, Stephen; Anderson, Peter] Adelphi Real World, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England; [Tolley, Keith] Tolley Hlth Econ Ltd, Buxton, England; [Colayco, Danielle; Khalaf, Kristin; Globe, Denise] Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Irvine, CA 92715 USA",Adelphi Group Ltd; AbbVie; Allergan,"Anderson, P (通讯作者)，Adelphi Real World Ltd, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",peter.anderson@adelphigroup.com,,,"Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA","Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA(AbbVieAllergan)","Financial support for this study was provided by a contract with Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA.

We introduce an efficient, one-level simulation method for the calculation of single-parameter EVPPI. Objective: We show that under mild regularity assumptions, the expectation-maximization-expectation sequence in EVPPI calculation can be transformed into an expectation-maximization-maximization sequence. By doing so, calculations can be performed in a single-step expectation by using data generated for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We prove that the proposed estimator of EVPPI converges in probability to the true EVPPI. Methods and Results: The performance of the new method was empirically demonstrated by using three exemplary decision models. Our proposed method seems to achieve remarkably higher accuracy than the two-level method with a fraction of its computation costs, though the achievement in accuracy was not uniform and varied across the parameters of the models. Software is provided to calculate single-parameter EVPPI based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis data. Conclusions: The new method, though applicable only to single-parameter EVPPI, is fast, accurate, and easy to implement. Further research is needed to evaluate the performance of this method in more complex scenarios and to extend such a concept to similar measures of decision uncertainty.","[Sadatsafavi, Mohsen] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Sadatsafavi, Mohsen; Zafari, Zafar; Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Marra, Carlo] Univ British Columbia, Collaborat Outcomes Res & Evaluat, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Sadatsafavi, Mohsen] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Coastal Hlth Inst, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Evaluat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Bansback, Nick] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Najafzadeh, Mehdi] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Mongan Inst Hlth Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital,"Sadatsafavi, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, 2146 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",sadatsafavi@alumni.ubc.ca,"Marra, Carlo/AAE-4904-2021; Sadatsafayi, Mohsen/AAZ-1593-2020","Marra, Carlo/0000-0002-2625-2121; Sadatsafayi, Mohsen/0000-0002-0419-7862; Bansback, Nick/0000-0002-1510-3462",Canadian Institute of Health Research [200889],Canadian Institute of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),M.S. was funded by a Canadian Institute of Health Research fellowship award (#200889) during this work.

Some general results concerning the correct weights for bias reduction under various sampling schemes are provided and the asymptotic properties of a jackknife estimator based on non-overlapping sub-samples are derived for the case of a stationary autoregression of order p when the number of sub-samples is either fixed or increases with the sample size at an appropriate rate. The results of a detailed investigation into the finite sample properties of various jackknife and alternative estimators are reported and it is found that the jackknife can deliver substantial reductions in bias in autoregressive models. This finding is robust to departures from normality, ARCH effects and misspecification. The median-unbiasedness and mean squared error properties are also investigated and compared with alternative methods as are the coverage rates of jackknife-based confidence intervals.

Methods: The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) study is a US national longitudinal survey of severe headache. Cost estimates were obtained via U.S. Census income data. To elucidate the unique predictors of LPT, the optimal distribution for modeling was determined. Zero inflation models for LPT were predicted from sociodemographics, headache features, characteristics and disability, medication use, and depression. The interaction between headache status and age was the primary effect of interest. Results: The eligible sample included 6329 persons with EM and 374 persons with CM. Men with CM aged 45 to 54 years cost employers nearly $200 per week more than do their EM counterparts. Likewise, for women, costs were higher for CM, with the cost differential between EM and CM being $90 per week. After comprehensive adjustment, increases in LPT with age were significantly higher in CM than in EM (rate ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.05). When age was recoded to a decade, metric rates of LPT increased 25% more per decade for CM than for EM (rate ratio 1.25; 95% confidence interval 1.004-1.5). Conclusions: LPT is more costly and increases more rapidly for those with CM than for those with EM as age increases.","[Serrano, Daniel; Reed, Michael L.] Vedanta Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27517 USA; [Manack, Aubrey N.; VaronPhd, Sepideh F.] Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Irvine, CA 92715 USA; [Buse, Dawn C.; Lipton, Richard B.] Montefiore Headache Ctr, Bronx, NY USA; [Buse, Dawn C.; Lipton, Richard B.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Bronx, NY 10467 USA",AbbVie; Allergan; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine,"Serrano, D (通讯作者)，Vedanta Res, 906 Emory Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27517 USA.",dserrano@vedantaresearch.com,"Serrano, Daniel/JVZ-5779-2024; Lipton, Richard B/B-5060-2011; Lipton, Richard Bruce/AAY-2818-2021",,"Ortho-McNeil Neurologics, Inc., Titusville, NJ; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA; National Headache Foundation; Allergan Pharmaceuticals; GlaxoSmithKline; ENDO Pharmaceuticals; MAP Pharmaceuticals; OrthoMcNeil; Merck, Inc.; Novartis; Iroko Pharmaceuticals; Minster; Neuralieve; Pfizer; National Institutes of Health","Ortho-McNeil Neurologics, Inc., Titusville, NJ; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA(AbbVieAllergan); National Headache Foundation; Allergan Pharmaceuticals(AbbVieAllergan); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); ENDO Pharmaceuticals; MAP Pharmaceuticals; OrthoMcNeil; Merck, Inc.(Merck & Company); Novartis(Novartis); Iroko Pharmaceuticals; Minster; Neuralieve; Pfizer(Pfizer); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","The AMPP study was funded by a grant to the National Headache Foundation by Ortho-McNeil Neurologics, Inc., Titusville, NJ.

Methods: The answers to the 22-item ZBI of 241 caregivers participating in a clinical trial were analyzed 1) with a Mokken nonparametric item response theory analysis to ascertain the dimensional structure underlying the scale and obtain a one-dimensional reduced version, 2) with the Samejima's graded response model to assess the item characteristics of the reduced version, and 3) with confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the unidimensionality of the reduced ZBI version and assess the item loadings to the burden latent variable. Results: Mokken analysis resulted in a major one-dimensional scale comprising 12 items directly related with burden. All items showed scalability indices over 0.30. The scalability for the overall scale was 0.44 defining a medium scale according to Mokken's criteria. An unconstrained Samejima's graded response model showed appropriate fit, and most items of the reduced 12-item ZBI presented pertinent difficulty and discrimination parameters. The results of the 12-item ZBI confirmatory factor analysis fitted to a one-dimensional latent structure for burden (comparative fit index = 0.975; root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.067; weighted root mean square residual = 0.677). All factor lodgings were above 0.40 with items 9 (strained by the relative) and 22 (overall feeling of burden) presenting the highest loadings.

Further psychometric studies, focusing on its equivalence for different populations, sensitivity to change, and minimal important difference are warranted.","[Ballesteros, Javier; Gonzalez-Fraile, Eduardo] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Neurosci Psychiat, Sch Med, E-48640 Leioa, Spain; [Ballesteros, Javier; Santos, Boria; Martin-Carrasco, Manuel] CIBERSAM, Madrid, Spain; [Gonzalez-Fraile, Eduardo; Munoz-Hermoso, Paula; Dominguez-Panchon, Ana I.; Martin-Carrasco, Manuel] IIP, Bilbao, Spain; [Munoz-Hermoso, Paula] Clin Psiquiatr Padre Menni, Pamplona, Spain; [Dominguez-Panchon, Ana I.] Hosp Aita Menni, Arrasate Mondragon, Spain",University of Basque Country; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERSAM,"Ballesteros, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Neurosci Psychiat, Sch Med, Barrio Sarriena S-N, E-48640 Leioa, Spain.",javier.ballesteros@ehu.es,"Ballesteros, Javier/O-8267-2015; Gonzalez-Fraile, Eduardo/AAG-7980-2019; González-Fraile, Eduardo/AAD-9355-2020; Santos, Borja/B-4987-2013","Ballesteros, Javier/0000-0002-6713-1916; González-Fraile, Eduardo/0000-0001-9381-3358; SANTOS ZORROZUA, BORJA/0000-0002-4002-2330","FIS [PI08/90812]; UPV/EHU [GIU07/07, GIU10/24]",FIS(Instituto de Salud Carlos III); UPV/EHU,"Source of financial support: The EDUCA-2 trial was funded by FIS (PI08/90812).

This uncertainty can result in a huge number of models. To avoid statistical problems associated with standard model selection procedures, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that allows us to do Bayesian model averaging. The algorithm is very flexible and can be easily adapted to analyze any of the different priors that have been proposed in the Bayesian instrumental variables literature. We show how to calculate the probability of any relevant restriction such as exogeneity or over-identification. We illustrate our methods in a returns-to-schooling application. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This article investigates the effect of changing macroeconomic conditions (measured by the unemployment rate in the state of residence) on one type of risky behavior: excessive alcohol consumption. Using unique and recent panel data from waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and estimating fixed-effects models, we find that changes in the unemployment rate are positively related to changes in binge drinking, alcohol-involved driving, and alcohol abuse and/or dependence. Some differences are present among demographic groups, primarily in the magnitude of the estimated effects. These results contradict previous studies and suggest that problematic drinking may be an indirect and unfortunate consequence of an economic downturn.

Foreign investment by a firm to exploit a new unregulated market with weak intellectual property rights can give rise to imitation. These products can potentially re-enter the original country when PI is allowed influencing research and development (R&D) incentives. In an emerging economy with technologically heterogeneous firms, trade costs shift PI-related market share losses from the more to the less R&D efficient firm, inducing the former to strategically increase R&D. PI accompanied by tariffs also induces higher R&D effort by the technologically inferior firm when it results in an expansion of its sales abroad. A tariff on PI is most likely to increase welfare when the technological gap between the two firms at home is sufficiently large.

We envisage that the pre-existing or core network is publicly provided. Strategic network formation is decentralized: Players act in their private interest and bear the costs when adding links to the pre-existing network. We study how the pre-existing network affects existence of Nash equilibria and efficiency of Nash equilibrium outcomes: It can foster or prohibit existence of Nash equilibria. It can improve or worsen equilibrium welfare. Special attention is paid to an insider outsider model where society is partitioned into several groups and links within a group (between insiders) are much cheaper than links across groups (between outsiders). We also present equilibrium existence results and examine the effect of Pareto optimal publicly provided networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Markov modeling was used to project the lifetime health benefits and costs associated with the antiviral treatments. The hypothetical patient population was hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B-infected patients aged 34 years. Quality-adjusted life-years were used as a measure of effectiveness. Long-term cumulative incidence of liver complications was also projected. Treatment effectiveness data were derived from the literature; meta-analysis was conducted when there was a large variance in reported effectiveness data. Costs were obtained from a cost analysis of treating chronic hepatitis B-related complications in Canada. Stochastic parameter uncertainty was examined in probabilistic sensitivity analysis by using second-order Monte Carlo simulation. Alternative modeling assumptions were assessed in scenario analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to explore each parameter's impact on the uncertainty of the results. Results: In the base-case analysis, telbivudine was dominated by entecavir and tenofovir. Tenofovir strictly dominated lamivudine, telbivudine, and entecavir. Over the 72-year period of the model, the expected life expectancy (undiscounted) of lamivudine, telbivudine, entecavir, and tenofovir was 35.71, 36.94, 37.65, and 37.99 years, respectively. Tenofovir had the highest expected quality-adjusted life-years at 11.86 (discounted) in all comparisons. Scenario and sensitivity analyses proved the robustness of the base-case results. The projected 10-year cumulative incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma was 11.40% and 3.05%, respectively, for tenofovir, which is significantly lower than that for lamivudine. Conclusion: Tenofovir generated the best results compared with all other therapies under evaluation.","[He, Jing] Canadian Inst Hlth Informat, Primary Hlth Care Informat Div, Toronto, ON M2P 2B7, Canada; [He, Jing; Bowen, James M.; Xie, Feng; Goeree, Ron] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [He, Jing; Bowen, James M.; Xie, Feng; Goeree, Ron] St Josephs Healthcare, Programs Assessment Technol, Hlth Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Canadian Institute Health Information; McMaster University,"He, J (通讯作者)，Canadian Inst Hlth Informat, Primary Hlth Care Informat Div, 4110 Yonge St,Suite 300, Toronto, ON M2P 2B7, Canada.",mail.jinghe@gmail.com,"Bowen, James/L-3077-2019","Bowen, James/0000-0002-6457-2337",,,,,68,16,16,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,894,906,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.005,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999140.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800016,0

We prove that the cyclomatic number is the minimum number of cycle equations that must be checked to guarantee the existence of a common prior, and explain why some cycle equations are automatically satisfied. There is an isomorphism taking cycles into cycle equations; adding cycles is the counterpart of multiplying the corresponding cycle equations. If the cyclomatic number is zero, a common prior always exists, regardless of the probabilistic information given by players' posteriors. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The analysis covers a range of important inference problems including testing stationarity against unit roots, testing for structure change in nonstationary regressions, and testing for cointegration. We analyze these inference problems in a unified regression framework, although separate analysis is given for each specific case when it is needed. The proposed inference procedures are constructed based on residuals of robust M-estimations. The limiting behavior of the proposed tests is investigated, and a Monte Carlo experiment is conducted. The proposed tests are easy to use and have advantages in the presence of non-Gaussian data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study was conducted to psychometrically validate the UFS-QOL-Hysterectomy questionnaire for potential use in comparative effectiveness research to evaluate uterine fibroid treatments. Methods: This multicenter prospective study enrolled premenopausal women aged 30 to 50 years with uterine fibroids who were scheduled for hysterectomy, myomectomy, or uterine fibroid embolization. All participants completed the UFS-QOL questionnaire and short form 36 health survey at baseline prior to treatment and 6 and 12 months postprocedure. Women with hysterectomy completed the UFS-QOL-Hysterectomy questionnaire during follow-up visits. Internal consistency reliability, discriminant and concurrent validity, and responsiveness were assessed. Results: A total of 274 women were enrolled (107 uterine fibroid embolization, 61 myomectomy, and 106 hysterectomy) and 89 (83%), 55 (90%), and 91 (86%), respectively, completed the 12-month follow-up. The mean age was 43.2 (uterine fibroid embolization), 40.6 (myomectomy), and 44.5 (hysterectomy) years; 53%, 43%, and 37%, respectively, were black. Cronbach's alphas for the UFS-QOL-Hysterectomy questionnaire at 6 months ranged from 0.70 to 0.96 and from 0.66 to 0.95 at 12months. Effect sizes ranged from 1.23 to 2.55, indicating that the UFS-QOL-Hysterectomy questionnaire was highly responsive. Conclusions: The UFS-QOL-Hysterectomy questionnaire is a valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measure of uterine fibroid treatment with hysterectomy and can be used in conjunction with the UFS-QOL questionnaire to compare patient-reported outcomes across treatments.","[Coyne, Karin S.; Margolis, Mary Kay] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Murphy, Jeanne] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Nursing, Baltimore, MD USA; [Spies, James] Georgetown Univ Hosp, Dept Radiol, Washington, DC 20007 USA",United Biosource Corporation; Johns Hopkins University; Georgetown University,"Coyne, KS (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",Karin.Coyne@unitedbiosource.com,"Murphy, Jeanne/AAK-9270-2020","Murphy, Jeanne/0000-0002-2460-7670",US Army (USAMRAA Award) [W81AWH-05-2-005],US Army (USAMRAA Award),"This study was supported by a grant from the US Army (USAMRAA Award #W81AWH-05-2-005, Gynecologic Disease Program).",,16,25,28,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,674,679,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.03.1387,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867776.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100010,0

The objective is to assess how patient heterogeneity affects list size, income and total utility of GPs operating under a mixed remuneration scheme. We adapt the model by Iversen (2004) as a theoretical framework for analysing the consequences of patient heterogeneity in a mixed remuneration system. We use a data set of Danish solo practitioners to analyse the effect of patient complexity on list size and income. From the theoretical model we find that higher levels of patient complexity lead GPs to choose a lower list size, whereas the effect on income is ambiguous. The effect on total utility (income and leisure) is, however, shown to be negative. Using empirical data from 1039 solo practices we find that patient complexity reduces both list size and income and conclude that a mixed per capita and fee for service remuneration system does not fully compensate practices with more complex patients. Differentiated per capita payment may represent a means of ensuring fair and equal income of GPs. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Olsen, K.

The use of aggregate data at the monthly level along with the distribution of unemployment duration allows us to separate the effect of job loss from the effect of unemployment duration, an important distinction for policy purposes, especially for the timing of potential interventions. Our results are consistent with unemployment duration being the dominant force in the relationship between job loss and suicide. Nevertheless, mass-layoffs may be powerful localized events where suicide risk increases shortly afterward. Implications for the design of unemployment insurance are discussed.

The data demonstrate a high degree of heterogeneity across respondents in their relative valuations on the two scales. This has implications for data analysis. We show that the estimates of WTP per QALY are highly sensitive to the analytical strategy. For both open-ended and dichotomous choice data we demonstrate that choice of aggregated approach (ratios of means) or disaggregated approach (means of ratios) affects estimates markedly as does the interpretation of the constant term (which allows for disproportionality across the two scales) in the regression analyses. We propose that future research should focus on why some respondents are unwilling to trade on the time trade-off scale, on how to interpret the constant value in the regression analyses, and on how best to capture the heterogeneity in preference structures when applying mixed multinomial logit.

Undersupply of medication could result in inadequate control of CHF, whereas oversupply of medication could increase health-care costs and risks of toxicities. This study aimed to determine the effects of medication supplies on health-care costs and hospitalizations in patients with CHF receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Methods: We retrospectively examined the electronic database in a hospital in Thailand. Patients who were diagnosed with CHF and who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in the year 2003 were included. Medication supplies were assessed by using the medication possession ratio (MPR). The Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the association of medication supply (appropriate supply: MPR 0.8-1.2, oversupply: MPR > 1.2, undersupply: MPR < 0.8) with CHF-related and all-cause hospitalizations. Health-care costs were compared by using multiple linear regressions. All analyses were adjusted for propensity score and other variables. Results: A total of 393 patients were included. Their mean age was 66 years, with 56% being females. Fifty-seven percent of the patients received an inappropriate-supply of medication. Undersupply of medication likely increased the risks of CHF-related hospitalization with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-3.46). The adjusted hazard ratio of undersupply and oversupply of medication for all-cause hospitalization was 1.13 (95% CI 0.74-1.73) and 3.19 (95% CI 0.66-15.47), respectively. The total health-care costs in the undersupply and oversupply groups were significantly greater than that in the appropriate-supply group: $49 (95% CI 32-66) and $103 (95% CI 32-173), respectively. Conclusions: Inappropriate medication supplies could increase the risks of CHF-related and all-cause hospitalizations.

Recent evidence shows correlations between the volume of broad-spectrum antibiotics used in the hospital setting and the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. According to this dynamic relationship, loss of antibiotic activity can be modeled as a negative externality of antibiotic consumption. Methods: The present study proposes to present an economic model describing the probability of antibiotic treatment failure as a function of antimicrobial use and alcohol-based hand-rub use. Furthermore, the results of recently conducted time-series analyses and cost-of-illness studies are applied to the model to determine the externalities of antibiotic consumption and alcohol-based hand-rub use with respect to the costs of hospital-acquired infections. Results: According to our calculations, the consumption of third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones is associated with the highest negative externalities ((sic)143 and (sic)101, respectively) because their use has been shown to be associated with most types of hospital-acquired infections. In contrast, the use of alcohol-based hand-rub solution for hand disinfection is associated with a positive externality of 41 cents per single disinfection of the hands. Conclusions: The externalities presented in this work represent a possible application of cost-of-illness data to quantify the impact of antibiotic use on antimicrobial resistance. In addition, the results indicate that most economic research on the topic is biased in assuming the overall use of antibiotics to be responsible for the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","[Kaier, Klaus] Univ Freiburg, Res Ctr Generat Contracts, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Kaier, Klaus] Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg,"Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Res Ctr Generat Contracts, Bertoldstr 17, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.",klaus.kaier@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,"Kaier, Klaus/B-4227-2009","Kaier, Klaus/0000-0003-0837-6945",Viamedica Foundation,Viamedica Foundation,The work was supported by a grant from the Viamedica Foundation.,,59,18,23,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,,,,87,93,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.09.005,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GU,22264976.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299318500011,0

The better-response demands are derived from assigning weights to all commodity bundles with higher utility than the current commodity bundle, with the greatest weights being placed on the commodity bundles with the highest utility gain. The usual utility-maximizing demand functions are then those in which the weight on the utility-maximizing bundle is one. We also show that these better-response demands belong to a large class of response maps that are generated by monotonic transformations of the utility functions and/or monotonic transformations of the weights assigned to the commodity bundles.

Our focus is on how the degree of factor substitution, as measured by the elasticity of factor substitution (BUS) in production, affects different balanced-budget tax rules. Analytically, we show that indeterminacy can occur under capital income taxation only when the EOS is very low, whereas indeterminacy under labor income taxation is not subject to the EOS restriction. This finding is robust when we tax all of the factor incomes with equal rates. Thus, in terms of macroeconomic stability, taxing capital income is preferred to taxing labor income.

In an ICAPM setting with conditional volatility, we find theoretical time series predictions on the relationships among volatility, returns, and skewness for priced risk factors. Market returns resemble these predictions; however, size, book-to-market, and momentum factor returns are not always consistent with our predictions. We find evidence that size and book-to-market may be priced post-crisis but not in the decade before. Momentum does not appear priced by our test. We link aggregate risk and skewness to individual stocks and find empirically that the risk aversion effect manifests in individual stock skewness. Additionally, we find several firm characteristics that explain stock skewness. Smaller firms, value firms, highly levered firms, and firms with poor credit ratings have more positive skewness.

Starting from the orthogonal decomposition of the sample variance matrix, we exploit the fact that orthogonal matrices are never ill-conditioned and therefore focus on improving the estimation of the eigenvalues. We estimate the eigenvectors from just a fraction of the data, then use them to transform the data into approximately orthogonal series that deliver a well-conditioned estimator (by construction), even when there are fewer observations than dimensions. We also show that our estimator has lower error norms than the traditional one. Our estimator is design-free: we make no assumptions on the distribution of the random sample or on any parametric structure the variance matrix may have. Simulations confirm our theoretical results and they also show that our simple estimator does very well in comparison with other existing methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Instead, they rely on the normalizing matrices that can eliminate the nuisance parameters in the limit. Compared with the conventional OIR test, the proposed tests require only a consistent, but not necessarily optimal, GMM estimator.

We relax this assumption by considering extensive games where agents may be unaware of the complete structure of the game. In particular, they may not be aware of moves that they and other agents can make. We show how such games can be represented; the key idea is to describe the game from the point of view of every agent at every node of the game tree. We provide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with awareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results to games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a player j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where players may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs are incompatible with a common prior.

The goal of this article was to examine whether physician social networks-as defined by shared patients-are associated with rates of complications after radical prostatectomy. Methods: In five cities, we constructed networks of physicians on the basis of their shared patients in 2004-2005 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data From these networks, we identified subgroups of urologists who most frequently shared patients with one another. Among men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy, we used multilevel analysis with generalized linear mixed-effect models to examine whether physician network structure-along with specific characteristics of the network subgroups-was associated with rates of 30 day and late urinary complications, and long-term incontinence after accounting for patient-level sociodemographic, clinical factors, and urologist patient volume. Results: Networks included 2677 men in five cities who underwent radical prostatectomy. The unadjusted rate of 30 day surgical complications varied across network subgroups from an 18.8 percentage-point difference in the rate of complications across network subgroups in city 1 to a 26.9 percentage-point difference in city 5. Large differences in unadjusted rates of late urinary complications and long-term incontinence across subgroups were similarly found. Network subgroup characteristics average urologist centrality and patient racial composition were significantly associated with rates of surgical complications. Conclusions: Analysis of physician networks using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data provides insight into observed variation in rates of complications for localized prostate cancer. If validated, such approaches may be used to target future quality improvement interventions.","[Pollack, Craig Evan] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Pollack, Craig Evan] Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Pollack, Craig Evan; Wang, Hao] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD USA; [Pollack, Craig Evan] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Bekelman, Justin E.; Epstein, Andrew J.; Liao, Kaijun; Dugoff, Eva H.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Weissman, Gary] Hosp Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Armstrong, Katrina] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital,"Pollack, CE (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Sch Med, 2024 East Monument St,Room 2-521, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",cpollac2@jhmi.edu,,"DuGoff, Eva/0000-0001-6673-8428; Weissman, Gary/0000-0001-9588-3819; Epstein, Andrew/0000-0001-5078-6564",,,,,49,36,41,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17,5.0,,,,,611,618,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.04.011,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128055.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700016,0

The new approach is used to investigate the question how income inequalities and income-related gradients in the distribution of health vary across age groups. With health data from the 2005 survey of the German microcensus, it is demonstrated that significant inequalities to the detriment of the deprived evolve in early mid-life and reach their maximum around the age for retirement. Some leveling is found for the elderly.

Methods: A consecutive, cross-sectional sample of 421 patients with cervical cancer was administered the World Health Organization Quality of Life-brief version questionnaires. A nationwide sample of 22,543 patients with invasive cervical cancer (ICC) was collected from the national cancer registry for estimation of lifetime survival function from 1998 to 2007, which was further multiplied by the ratio of HRQOL score functions for patients with ICC and patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), and summed up over lifetime to obtain expected relative-quality-adjusted survival. The difference between lifetime survival and the expected relative-quality-adjusted survival gives the expected total dissatisfied time during the life course. Results: In comparison with patients with CIS postconization, patients with ICC showed consistently lower scores in the physical and psychological domains and that of sexual life after adjustment for other risk factors. The expected years of life lost for an invasive cancer was 648 years using the general population as the reference cohort, while the durations of equivalent to living with a very dissatisfied HRQOL were 1.71 and 0.25 for the physical and psychological domains, respectively, and 1.47 years for sexual life. Validation of the extrapolation method based on a subcohort followed from the 6th to the 13th year shows a relative bias of 0.4%. Sensitivity analysis with 37,000 CIS cases as the reference cohort yields a similar result Conclusions: Early detection of cervical cancer not only avoids premature mortality but also prevents long-term living under lower HRQOL scores, including sexual life.","[Hung, Mei-Chuan; Wang, Jung-Der] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Wu, Ching-Lin; Hsu, Yu-Yun] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Nursing, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Hwang, Jing-Shiang] Acad Sinica, Inst Stat Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Cheng, Ya-Min] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Wang, Jung-Der] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Wang, Jung-Der] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital,"Wang, JD (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",jdwang121@gmail.com,"Hwang, Jing-Shiang/AAP-2835-2021","Hwang, Jing-Shiang/0000-0002-5807-7583","National Science Council [NSC 99-2628-B-006-036-MY3, NSC 102-2314-B-006-029-MY2]; National Cheng Kung University Hospital [NCKUH-10103040]; Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan [DOH101-TD-C-111-003]; Ministry of Education of Taiwan","National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); National Cheng Kung University Hospital; Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan; Ministry of Education of Taiwan(Ministry of Education, Taiwan)","This work was supported by grants from the National Science Council (grant no.

The aim was to test whether preferences (as measured by willingness to pay additional tax) would be affected by framing the willingness-to-pay question differently. Results demonstrated that valuations were highly sensitive to whether respondents were asked to express their maximum willingness to pay per month or per year. Another important finding is that the introduction of a binary response filter prior to the payment card follow-up tends to eliminate the positive aspects of introducing a payment card and produces response patterns that are much in line with those of the open-ended contingent valuation format. However, although a filter will impact on the distribution of willingness-to-pay bids and on the rate of zero and protest bids, the overall impact on the welfare estimate is minor. The outcomes of this study indicate that valuations in the stated preference literature may be, at least in part, a function of the instrument designed to obtain the valuations.

Using data from eight U.S. cities, we determine whether drinker-drivers differ from other drinkers in cognitive ability, ignorance of driving while intoxicated (DWI) laws, have higher rates of time preference, are time inconsistent, and lack self-control on other measures. We find that drinker-drivers are relatively knowledgeable about DWI laws and do not differ on two of three study measures of cognitive ability from other drinkers. Drinker-drivers are less prone to plan events involving drinking, e.g., selecting a designated driver in advance of drinking, and are more impulsive. Furthermore, we find evidence in support of hyperbolic discounting. In particular, relative to non-drinker-drivers, the difference between short- and long-term discount rates is much higher for drinker-drivers than for other drinkers. Implications of our findings for public policy, including incapacitation, treatment, and educational interventions, are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Thompson, O",,,,"Thompson, Owen",,,Genetic mechanisms in the intergenerational transmission of health,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health transmission; Genetics; Adoptees,,"This paper uses a sample of adoptees to study the genetic mechanisms underlying intergenerational associations in chronic health conditions. I begin by estimating baseline intergenerational models with a sample of approximately 125,000 parent-child pairs, and find that children with a parent who has a specific chronic health condition are at least 100% more likely to have the same condition themselves. To assess the role of genetic mechanisms in generating these strong correlations,! estimate models using a sample of approximately 2400 adoptees, and find that genetic transmission accounts for only 20-30% of the baseline associations. As falsification tests, I repeat this exercise using health measures with externally established levels of genetic determination (height and chicken pox), and the results suggest that comparisons of biological and adopted children are a valid method of isolating genetic effects in this sample. Finally, to corroborate these adoptee-based estimates, I examine health correlations among monozygotic twins, which provide an upper bound estimate of genetic influences, and find a similarly modest role for genetic transmission. I conclude that intergenerational health transmission is an important hindrance to overall socioeconomic mobility, but that the majority of transmission occurs through environmental factors or gene-environment interactions, leaving scope for interventions to effectively mitigate health persistence.

Examples include, intraday price curves, yield and term structure curves, and intraday volatility curves. Such curves can be viewed as a time series of functions. A fundamental issue that must be addressed, before an attempt is made to statistically model such data, is whether these curves, perhaps suitably transformed, form a stationary functional time series. This paper formalizes the assumption of stationarity in the context of functional time series and proposes several procedures to test the null hypothesis of stationarity. The tests are nontrivial extensions of the broadly used tests in the KPSS family. The properties of the tests under several alternatives, including change-point and 1(1), are studied, and new insights, present only in the functional setting are uncovered. The theory is illustrated by a mall simulation study and an application to intraday price curves. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: This longitudinal retrospective observational research used Medical Expenditure Panel Survey household component pooled years 2006 to 2009 to analyze adults 18 years or older with nongestational diabetes and coexistent essential hypertension. Two groups were created: 1) antihypertensive medication users and 2) no antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. We examined average annualized health care costs and emergency department and hospital utilization. Accounting for Medical Expenditure Panel Survey's complex survey design, all analyses used longitudinal weights. Logistic regressions examined the likelihood of utilization and anytihypertensive medication use, and log-transformed multiple linear regression models assessed costs and antihypertensive medication use. Results: Of the 3261 adults identified with diabetes, 66% (n = 2137) had concomitant hypertension representing 38.7 million individuals during 2006 to 2009. Significantly, the 16% (n = 338) no antihypertensive pharmacotherapy group showed greater mean nights hospitalized (3.6 vs. 1.7, P = 0.0120), greater all-cause hospitalization events per 1000 patient months (41 vs. 24, P = 0.0.007), and lower mean diabetes related and hypertension related ambulatory visits. After adjusting for confounders, non-antihypertensive medication users showed 1.64 odds of hospitalization, 29% lower total, and 27% lower average annualized medical expenses compared with antihypertensive medication users. Conclusions: In adults with diabetes and coexistent hypertension, we observed significantly greater hospitalizations and lower costs for the non antihypertensive pharmacotherapy group versus those using antihypertensive medications. The short-term time horizon greater hospitalizations with lower expenses among non-antihypertensive medication users with diabetes and concomitant hypertension warrant further study.","[Davis-Ajami, Mary Lynn] Univ Maryland, Sch Nursing, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Wu, Jun] Univ S Carolina, South Carolina Coll Pharm, Greenville, SC USA; [Fink, Jeffrey C.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; Medical University of South Carolina; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Davis-Ajami, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Nursing, 655 West Lombard St,465D, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",davis-ajami@son.umaryland.edu,"Wu, Jun/V-3936-2019","Davis-Ajami, Mary Lynn/0000-0002-4974-1796; Fink, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5622-5052",,,,,51,5,6,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN,2014,17,1.0,,,,,51,61,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.11.008,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,291RS,24438717.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329847500008,0

The methods include Kolmogorov Smirnov and Cramer-von Mises-type tests for the correct specification of predictive densities robust to dynamic mis-specification. The novelty is that the tests can detect mis-specification in the predictive densities even if it appears only over a fraction of the sample, due to the presence of instabilities. Our results indicate that our tests are well sized and have good power in detecting mis-specification in predictive densities, even when it is time-varying. An application to density forecasts of the Survey of Professional Forecasters demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed methodologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I focus mainly on the models under the conditional median restriction, as in Manski (1985). I find sharp bounds on the components of the parameter of interest and outline several applications. The formulas for bounds obtained using a recursive procedure help analyze cases where one regressor's support becomes increasingly dense. Furthermore, I investigate asymptotic properties of estimators of the identification set. I describe a relation between the maximum score estimation and support vector machines and propose several approaches to address the problem of empty identification sets when the model is misspecified.

We show that it is NP-hard to compute a community containing a given set of vertices. On the other hand, we show how to compute a community structure in polynomial time for any connected graph containing at least four vertices except the star graph S-n. Finally, we generalize our results and formally show that counterintuitive aspects are unavoidable for any definition of a community structure with a polynomial time algorithm for computing communities containing specific vertices.
