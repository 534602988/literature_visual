Economic theory predicts that households will maintain diversified strategies when faced with risk; however, many studies have claimed that openness to markets drives specialisation to enhance returns. Nevertheless, there is little evidence about the association between trade in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and the diversity of NTFPs consumed. Relying on a household survey and systematic observations of Brazilian Amazonian Caboclos, we evaluated whether exposure to NTFP markets (effort and cash income) correlates with the diversity of NTFPs consumed (richness and Simpson diversity). The results were conflicting. First, there was variation across NTFP subtypes: although the variety (richness) of terrestrial NTFPs consumed (vegetables and hunted animals) was greater in households trading NTEPs, the richness of fish consumed was lower because fishing could not be pursued concurrently with activities related to NTFP trade. Second, the observed effects differed across indicators of diversity, which shows that intensification in the use of a few resources may occur. Third, the associations with alternative definitions of exposure to the NTFP market also differed. These results indicate that NTFP markets do not necessarily undermine local consumption diversity.

Efficiency is computed using a semi-dynamic DEA-framework. On the input side we include a measure of input quality and we also control for services that are carried out by private contractors. On the output side we are using both intermediate and final outputs. The motivation for using an intermediate output is to take into account the fact that employment offices might have strengthen the possibility for unemployed individuals that remain unemployed to get a job in the forthcoming year. The study identifies an average yearly inefficiency between 7 and 10 percent. It is also observed that the inefficiency is unevenly distributed. To make employment offices more efficient this uneven distribution needs to be considered, otherwise efforts to improve efficiency might instead result in increased inefficiency.

Land-use displacement and associated carbon emissions can undermine the effectiveness of land-use and climate policies, such as activities to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Nevertheless, few accounting methods exist for international emissions leakage from land-use change, due to methodological and policy challenges. In this paper we review methods to quantify international land-use displacement and teleconnections through international trade. Weaknesses and strengths of those methods are assessed as well as the conclusiveness of results. We identify limitations and potential ways forward for the quantification of land-related leakage in general, while highlighting implications for REDD-leakage accounting in particular. Results show that land-related leakage assessments are facilitated by applying a weak leakage definition, without the requirement to demonstrate causal leakage effects. Suitable quantification approaches combine method elements such as economic modeling, trade-flow analysis, biophysical accounting and life-cycle assessments. Depending on the use of monetary or physical input data the results can change considerably. All reviewed methods face limitations such as uncertainties and data gaps in emission factors.

A preference for sons results in a biased sex ratio towards men and creates a shortage of brides in the marriage market. Using the Indian census of 1931, the article finds that son preference was a regional phenomenon and led to a low marriage rate for men. Using caste-level information, the article finds no evidence that men from the upper castes enjoyed an advantage in the marriage market as the theoretical literature predicts. The regional differences in gender bias and marriage market outcomes have persisted over the twentieth century and indicate the persistence of cultural values. The long-run changes show that the marriage squeeze has reduced the surplus of men in all regions; however, the regional differences in son preference and marriage outcomes were still the same in 2001.","Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Gupta, B (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,,,ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,16,17,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - Validated questionnaires, adapted based on a pre-study, were completed by Norwegian volunteers. Participants were randomly recruited by telephone and were at least 50 per cent responsible for the food in the household. The survey included questions about: first, use of and trust in information sources; second, use of and interest in information cues; third, objective and subjective knowledge; and fourth, fish consumption and buying behaviour. Findings - The results of this study (n = 713) led to three consumer segments: Label trusters (40 per cent), Info skippers (19 per cent) and Info seekers (41 per cent) with significant (p<0.001) differences in use of and trust in information sources and reactions to information cues. Particular needs of these clusters regarding product labelling were identified. Social implications - Increased product visibility and simplified product packaging with selective and targeted information for each consumer group will lead to a better differentiation of fish products in a competitive market and hence to an increased consumption of health-promoting fish by the Norwegian population. Originality/value - This manuscript is one of the few that shows how particular types of labelling could be summarised, minimised or moved in order to reach potential consumers with a better presented product that carries information in more strategic placement than what one can find on current seafood packaging.","[Altintzoglou, Themistoklis; Nostvold, Bjorg Helen] Nofima, Consumer & Market Dept, Tromso, Norway",Nofima,"Altintzoglou, T (通讯作者)，Nofima, Consumer & Market Dept, Tromso, Norway.",themis.altintzoglou@nofima.no,"Altintzoglou, Themistoklis/AEO-3958-2022","Altintzoglou, Themistoklis/0000-0002-9877-966X",Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs,Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs,The Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs is greatly acknowledged for partially financing this research.,,25,7,8,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In order to investigate the role of collateral in SMEs relationship lending, we undertook an extended survey-based research on Romanian SMEs. Based on a multiple linear regression and using the method of ordinary least squares, we analysed and tested the effect of the main determinants of the relationship banking on the collaterals required in loan contracts. We found out that SMEs with long-term relationship with a bank are open to offer more guarantees than those firms that count on trust relationship. The number of SME's banking relationships is negatively correlated with the firms' availability to accept the collateral condition, as the young and competitive SMEs are less prone to provide collaterals for claimed loans. Moreover, older firms agree to the collateral requirements of banks. Finally, SMEs perceive that banks require larger collaterals for long-term loans, compared with short term loans with similar value. Our results are in line with previous researches, but also bring additional interpretations of banks' role related to SMEs' expectations.","[Badulescu, Daniel; Simut, Ramona; Badulescu, Alina] Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,"Badulescu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, 1 Univ Str, Oradea, Romania.",dbadulescu@uoradea.ro; simut.ramona@yahoo.com; abadulescu@uoradea.ro,"Badulescu, Alina/B-6477-2015; Badulescu, Daniel/O-4877-2017; Badulescu, Alina/AAC-4228-2020; Simut, Ramona/AAN-4689-2020","Badulescu, Alina/0000-0002-0090-9340; Badulescu, Daniel/0000-0001-8653-0149;",,,,,15,6,6,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,43,52,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700005,0

Based on Warde's antinomies of structural opposition, we found several consumer dilemmas including the dilemma of choosing between organic and eco-friendly food. This study addresses ethical and environmental concerns that contemporary Swedish consumers have when eating organic and taking environmental action and presents some consumer strategies used to cope with these concerns. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical data was collected from a consumer panel followed during 18 months. A mix of qualitative methods was used; interviews, shop-along studies, ZMET, collecting shopping receipts and poems. Findings - The research paper contributes with knowledge about the dilemma between organic and eco-friendly. It further defines the strategy of justification of non-choices as the most common consumer strategy to cope with the dilemma. Research limitations/implications - Results from this study shows that conscious consumers often face a conflict between buying organic food and taking environmental considerations. In order to solve the conflict consumers used various strategies; justification of non-choices was the most common strategy. Practical implications - For wholesalers and retailers the results show that conscious consumers demands groceries that are both organic and eco-friendly in order to act on intentions.

Food is also shown to be a critical dimension of ethnic and national identity and to have a heritage worthy of protection. In addition, it is a tourist attraction which affords insights into destination culture. Defining a national cuisine, however, is complicated in multiracial societies and origins and ownership of so-called national dishes may be disputed.

As a result of the simulations sufficiency of main financial data of insurers, such as technical provisions, the technical result, net income, surplus funds to cover reserves and surplus capital to cover solvency margin relative to cover compensations for pain and suffering will be examined. The authors will analyse the consequences of possible changes in the average amount of claims, number of claims for the MTPL insurance market in Poland. Simulations will be based on financial data of insurance companies, data concerning the number of accidents, and victims of accidents in Poland (police data) and data from Polish jurisdiction will be used to analyze tendencies in claim amounts.","[Jedrzychowska, Anna; Poprawska, Ewa] Wroclaw Univ Econ, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Jedrzychowska, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",anna.jedrzychowska@ue.wroc.pl; ewa.poprawska@ue.wroc.pl,"Jędrzychowska, Anna/U-6688-2017","Jędrzychowska, Anna/0000-0002-3837-1734",,,,,10,1,1,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,541,551,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700053,0

Design/methodology/approach - A case study approach was chosen covering four specialty food companies in Norway. This explorative study was conducted from the producer's perspective. Findings - Results show that, as part of growth processes, firms invest in different activities to strengthen the quality of their products to achieve distinctiveness in more competitive markets. The most important quality that contributes to distinctiveness and increased value seems to be traditional handicraft production processes. In some cases, expensive and time-consuming processes are invested in developing qualities that are not transformed into higher value in the market. Research limitations/implications - The number of cases is too small for statistical analysis, but this explorative case study may provide a basis for a survey of a larger sample of firms. Practical implications - The study indicates a need for companies to gain more knowledge about consumers' preferences and behaviour, and to develop product qualities and market communication accordingly. Originality/value - Research is scarce on obstacles to growth in specialty food firms. This study contributes important knowledge to enhance further development of the industry.","[Kvam, Gunn-Turid; Magnus, Trine; Straete, Egil Petter] Ctr Rural Res, Trondheim, Norway",,"Kvam, GT (通讯作者)，Ctr Rural Res, Trondheim, Norway.",gunn.turid.kvam@rural.no,"Stræte, Egil Petter/HJJ-1373-2023","Straete, Egil Petter/0000-0002-3995-9898",Research Council of Norway; Foundation for the Research Levy on Agricultural Products,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Foundation for the Research Levy on Agricultural Products,"This project was mainly funded by the Research Council of Norway and the Foundation for the Research Levy on Agricultural Products, and was conducted during the period 2008-2011.",,24,7,8,3,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Assessment of foreign exchange risk is not a simple process, although it is generally accepted that the standard method for valuing financial risk today is the value-at-risk (VaR) method, which provides a quantitative measure of the downside risk of exposure in all foreign currency transactions. The aim of the study is recognized as the first step the Baltic States non-financial companies must take before considering risk mitigation strategies to reduce and, hopefully, eliminate foreign transaction exposure. Empirical analysis of the most-widely used currencies in the Baltic States confirms that more liquid currencies have smaller foreign exchange exposure comparing with not so commonly used. Conducted analysis shows that loss from unhedged foreign currency positions, as estimated by VaR methods, for several Baltic companies could be relatively large and shows the need for managing the risks.

Using the example of the increasing attention to well-being, both within policy and academic circles, we seek to contribute to current critical considerations of 'the sustainable person' (Becker, 2010, 2012). We do this by incorporating often neglected perspectives from disciplines rooted in the Arts and Humanities - specifically anthropology and philosophy - introducing to debates on sustainability the notion of 'homo faber'. Our aim is threefold: (1) to invite creative thinking about the role that materiality and practice play in the constitution of alternative notions of 'being'; (2) to soften the anthropocentrism of western worldviews by considering the possibility of a different mode of humanity based upon connection rather than separation, interdependence rather than autonomy (Gibson-Graham, 2011:2), and (3) to encourage deeper reflection about the need for, and the challenge of interdisciplinary sustainability research.

A decentralized system is more flexible in that it can better adapt resources to local needs. Moreover, if regional political parties have responsibility for public health policies, citizens will be able to elect those parties whose positions are more in line with their preferences. However, the role of political parties in public health management has received little attention in the literature. Focusing on the decision to provide reserve service capacity to deal with demand uncertainty, we analyse whether there have been differences between central and decentralized health authorities in Spain and whether these can be explained to some extent by the way different political parties manage the trade-off between being able to cover demand and the economic costs involved. Using data on Spanish public hospitals for the period 1996-2006, we model the difference between observed and potential output using an output-oriented distance function. Reserve capacity is modelled as a function of demand uncertainty, economic costs and the political party in power. We find differences in the way resources are managed by central government and decentralized authorities, even within the same political party. We also find differences between the decentralized authorities themselves according to the political party in power. We conclude that decentralization of public health in Spain has provided regional political authorities with greater flexibility to manage reserve capacity in line with citizens' needs and preferences.","[Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana; Roibas-Alonso, David; Wall, Alan] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Wall, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business, Ave Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain.",awall@uniovi.es,"Roibas, David/F-7969-2017; Wall, Alan/L-1921-2017; Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/G-6344-2010","Roibas, David/0000-0001-9904-0085; Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/0000-0002-2492-5070",,,,,38,4,4,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

It is widely debated whether offshoring has played a role in this fall by replacing domestic intermediates by imported intermediates. This paper develops a decomposition analysis to measure the contribution of offshoring - the share of imported intermediates in total intermediates - to the fall in air emissions for domestic intermediates. Based on the results from this decomposition analysis, it was possible to calculate that 17% of the fall in greenhouse gas emissions, 6% of the fall in acidifying emissions and 7% of the fall in tropospheric precursor emissions in Belgian manufacturing between 1995 and 2007 can be attributed to offshoring.

In all cases, patient-appointment times and visit days are known prior to the beginning of the planning horizon. Variations in the models include single vs. multiple home bases, homogeneous vs. heterogeneous therapists, lunch break requirements, and a nonlinear cost structure for mileage reimbursement and overtime. The single home base and homogeneous therapist cases proved to be easy to solve and so were not thoroughly investigated. This left two cases of interest: the first included only lunch breaks while the second added nonlinear overtime and mileage reimbursement costs. For the first case, 40 data sets were solved, each consisting of either 15 or 20 therapists and between roughly 300 and 540 patient visits over five days. For each instance, we were able to obtain the minimum cost of providing residential healthcare services using a commercial solver. The results showed that CPU time increases more rapidly than total cost as the total number of visits grows. For the second case, which was much more difficult, it was necessary to develop heuristics to find good solutions quickly. Results for 5- through 20-therapist instances are presented and compared to the linear programming relaxation lower bounds.

Most respondents (85%) support breed conservation, their stated willingness-to-pay easily justifying EU support. The high landscape maintenance, existence and future option values of both breeds (around 80% of their TEVs) suggest that incentives mechanisms are indeed needed in order to allow farmers to capture some of these public good values and hence motivate them to undertake conservation-related activities. The positive direct use values of both breeds (around 20% of their TEVs) imply that niche product markets aimed at enhancing the private good values associated with conservation could also form elements of a conservation and use strategy for these breeds.

A transdisciplinary approach is a key component of sustainability science. However, there are considerable barriers to implementing transdisciplinary projects. We undertake a mixed quantitative and qualitative analysis of peer-reviewed sustainability science studies where the transdisciplinary approach has been applied. We assess the growth and scientific impact of transdisciplinary sustainability research, the methods used and how three key characteristics of transdisciplinarity research-process phases, knowledge types and the intensity of involvement of practitioners-are implemented. While transdisciplinary research is growing there is no common glossary, no focused communication platform and no commonly shared research framework. Transdisciplinary research utilizes a broad, but not clearly defined, set of methods for knowledge production. While the intensity of practitioner involvement varied within the case studies analyzed, very few realized empowerment. Based on our review of transdisciplinary case study papers we conclude that transdisciplinary research must be clearly framed, including the use of a common terminology and the development of a broad suite of appropriate methods. Despite the challenges highlighted here, science needs to move beyond classical disciplinary approaches and should consider interdisciplinary work that engages with practitioners to achieve sustainable transitions.

Our central objective is to apply observations from the social science literature about homeowner preferences to this economic externality problem and determine how assumptions about insurance, information and starting fuel loads affect outcomes and the effectiveness of policy. Three new features of our approach are, first, to assess fuel treatment behavior under potential misinformation scenarios, second, to allow for heterogeneous starting fuel loads across ownerships, and, finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of insurance and direct regulation at improving outcomes. Among other results, we find that risk-adjusted insurance may not create incentives for fuel treatment when government suppression exists, and in games with heterogeneous starting fuel loads, the social costs from misinformation can persist over a greater range of fire probability and damage function parameter values. These results suggest that, even as information about wildfire improves, the social costs inherent in private decisions will be more persistent than previously thought on landscapes where fuel stock differs across ownerships.

Disagreement persists. This article examines a key aspect of agricultural labourers' families' welfare: nutrient consumption. We utilize datasets of the diets of agricultural labourers' households for 1787-96, 1835-46, 1863, 1893, and 1912, to analyse the availability of calories and 11 key nutrients. Self-provisioned foodstuffs are incorporated and adjustments are made for beer consumption. Deficiency is computed against household needs. The results corroborate the general levels of calorie availability identified in agricultural production accounts for the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and assess these as sufficient for productive agricultural labour. However, no improvement is found in the nutritional aspect of household welfare between 1787-96 and 1835-46, thus endorsing pessimistic views of living standards for this group over this time period. Gains were evident in the next half-century, but these improvements were neither consistent nor dramatic and left a large minority of these households with nutrient deficiencies even in the twentieth century.","[Gazeley, Ian] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Horrell, Sara] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Sussex; University of Cambridge,"Gazeley, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",,,"Gazeley, Ian/0000-0002-4277-1001",,,,,52,16,18,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The revival followed the extension of sugar cultivation in England's colonies and the creation of a strong new demand for copper, which was reflected in rising exports and rising prices. Buoyant demand created a favourable market for the inventive activity needed to cut costs in the native industry, which encouraged investment in a systematic programme of research and development and culminated in important breakthroughs in smelting and mining technologies which transformed the non-ferrous metal industries. The story provides an insight into how the economic context shaped the way useful knowledge was produced and consumed. Colonial expansion not only provided England with additional resources overseas but also encouraged the reallocation of human and financial capital to make better use of slack resources at home. Empire and technical change intersected with positive consequences for economic growth.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Zahedieh, N (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,,94,22,25,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

It does this by identifying 'best practice' YOIs using recently-developed Data Envelopment Analysis that caters for both good and undesirable outputs (such as assaults and testing positive for illicit drugs by inmates), thereby allowing policymakers to deliver cost savings through the spread of management techniques adopted by benchmark YOIs. The study also analyses the size-efficiency relationship for YOIs in England and Wales and finds that, although the smallest institutions are typically the most efficient, the size-efficiency relationship is quite complex. This calls into question the Government's wisdom of building 'titan' prisons in England and Wales which, perversely, might decrease the efficiency of rehabilitating young offenders.

First, to analyse the spread of labelled environmental certification in food products, considering both private labels and producer brands with reference to the Italian and German markets. Second, to outline how environmental certification can affect the vertical organisation of food supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - The method used is based on an empirical analysis carried out in two sample cities: Milan for Italy and Bonn for Germany, examining ten and seven retailers, respectively, using the case studies approach, through an ad hoc questionnaire. The authors analysed two cases related to fruit and vegetables and ichthyic products, in order to assess the effect of the standards provided by the sustainability certification on the vertical organisation of the supply chains. Findings - The certifications focus on three main areas: ichthyic products; tropical products; and fruits and vegetables. They are much more widespread on private label items, rather than on the industrial brands. The German market is more sensitive to sustainability issues than the Italian market. Environmental certification leads to a reorganisation of the supply chain relationships, determining a higher bilateral dependency among the supply chain agents, a reduction in product uncertainty, and an increased degree of vertical coordination. Originality/value - The paper analyses, through a new perspective, the environmental issues of food products, quantifying the spread of labelled environmental certification and comparing Italy and Germany. The vertical reorganisation of the supply chains involved the adoption of production rules, connected to environmentally-friendly practices, and the introduction of a new form of transaction governance.","[Banterle, Alessandro; Cereda, Eleonora] Univ Milan, Dept Agr Food & Environm Econ, Milan, Italy; [Fritz, Melanie] Univ Bonn, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Milan; University of Bonn,"Banterle, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Agr Food & Environm Econ, Milan, Italy.",alessandro.banterle@unimi.it,"Fritz, Melanie/C-3437-2014; Banterle, Alessandro/ACT-7678-2022","BANTERLE, ALESSANDRO/0000-0003-2301-5646",,,,,32,32,33,2,64,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - After an exploratory pre-study with 12 participants, a full study of Swedish manufacturers comprised of representatives from 12 food companies was initiated. In total, 21 interviews were carried out. The majority of the respondents had food industry experience. They initially answered structured questions and thereafter open-ended ones. Findings - Few, if any, innovations in the Swedish food sector are considered radical. Many are invisible to meet demands for lower cost, shorter orders and sustainability. The food manufacturers seem to develop products in house for consumers and not by working with them or others inside or outside the supply chain; they do not adopt an open innovation mindset. There is lack of trust in the chain and limited exchange of information. Some manufacturers pursue horizontal collaboration with other manufacturers abroad. Research limitations/implications - Innovations and strategies are a competitive edge for a company, so the respondents may not have been completely open. Practical implications - Manufacturers and the whole supply chain would benefit from an open innovation mindset to organise and work differently and build trust. Originality/value - There is no other published study on innovations and food manufacturers in Sweden. The food sector should embark on collaboration and coopetion and initiate discussions on what can be done to become more innovative.","[Beckeman, Marit; Olsson, Annika] Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, Div Packaging Logist, Lund, Sweden; [Bourlakis, Michael] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England",Lund University; University of Kent,"Beckeman, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, Div Packaging Logist, Lund, Sweden.",marit.beckeman@plog.lth.se,"Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012","Bourlakis, Michael/0000-0001-5093-5398; Olsson, Annika/0000-0001-9624-1658",,,,,59,21,23,1,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Six food processing SMEs were selected and subsidized to introduce ICT on condition that the SMEs agree to conduct business diagnostics to identify ICT needs, adopt ICT capabilities recommended, agree to outcomes being monitored and the findings being published. Findings - Two amongst the six rigorously selected SMEs did not complete the project citing resource constraints, reveals constraints experienced by SMEs in adopting new technology. Four SMEs that completed the project achieved increased operating efficiency or business growth, demonstrating the benefits of ICT adoption. The study concludes that rigorous business analysis is an important precursor to ICT adoption initiatives and SME resource constraints in such initiatives can be successfully overcome through enterprise-government-university partnerships. Research limitations/implications - A longitudinal study, a larger sample size and quantitative data gathering would embellish the findings. Practical implications ICT adoption is a cost-efficient strategy to facilitate business growth and profitability in SMEs. Because many SMEs may not have appropriate technical and managerial capabilities, enterprise-government-university partnerships are a useful model to undertake such initiatives. Knowledge and methodology from this study could inform public policy action to encourage new technology adoption by SMEs.

Yet, the benefits of NRM technologies for farmers are often debated. Impacts seem to be context-specific, which are especially relevant in the small farm sector with its large degree of agroecological and socioeconomic heterogeneity. This was not always considered in previous research. We analyze the impacts of SRI adoption on rice yield and household income among smallholder farmers in Timor Leste. Heterogeneity is accounted for in an endogenous switching regression framework. Comparing mean yield and income levels, we find no significant differences between SRI adopters and non-adopters. This is due to negative selection bias; SRI seems to be adopted more on plots and by farmers with less than average yields. Controlling for this bias reveals significant yield and income gains. Poor and non-poor households benefit from SRI adoption; small farms benefit more than larger farms. The results also suggest that in the context of Timor Leste SRI may not be beneficial when compared to conventional rice grown under favorable conditions. Some implications for future research are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach Cross-sectional data were collected through a pan-European consumer survey (n = 4,828) with samples representative for age, gender and region in Belgium, France, Italy, Norway, Poland and Spain. Data analyses included multivariate logistic regressions and a multi-group structural equation modelling analysis. Findings Individuals with overweight or obesity attach more importance to weight control when purchasing food, and tend to self-identify themselves more as consumers of traditional foods. Among individuals with obesity, importance attached to the natural content of food is directly associated with traditional food consumption, and importance attached to sensory appeal in food choice is indirectly associated with self-identification as a traditional food consumer. Among individuals with normal weight, importance attached to healthiness in food choice associates negatively with self-identification as a traditional food consumer. Originality/value This study provides a unique approach for testing the motives for consuming traditional food among people with different nutritional status, particularly with normal weight, overweight and obesity.

However, modern aquaculture introduced a range of potentially controversial issues, which may impact public perceptions. The purpose of this paper is to compare consumer perceptions of the production and consumption of wild and farmed fish in Europe. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 28 focus groups were conducted in the capitals of seven European counties: France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Norway, Spain and the UK, between January-March 2009. Data were analyzed with the qualitative software Atlas/ti. Findings - Focus group discussions centre on a broad range of themes: economic risks and benefits, environmental concerns, human health issues, trust and nature. Europeans weigh up the scientific risks and benefits of farmed versus wild fish. However, when considering non-scientific concerns, such as trust and nature, consumers prefer wild to farmed fish. Respondents have less trust in the production and consumption of farmed fish than in their wild counterparts, as the former are perceived as unnatural and unfamiliar. Originality/value - Results have implications for the development of public communication strategies. The predicted growth of aquaculture highlights the importance of communicating the risks and benefits of farmed fish and fish farming effectively. The authors' findings show that a communication needs to incorporate moral and ethical risk dimensions, as these are the distinguishing areas leading to consumer preference of wild over farmed fish.","[Schlag, Anne Katrin; Ystgaard, Kaja] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Schlag, AK (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England.",anne.schlag@kcl.ac.uk,"Schlag, Anne/AAK-9826-2020",,European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),The present study has been sponsored by the DARVMAR grant from the European Union (6th framework) as part of the EU-wide AQUAMAX project (www.aquamaxip.eu/).,,47,51,56,1,66,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The antioxidant activity and type II diabetes related enzyme inhibition properties of methanolic extract and their relationship with phenolic content was demonstrated. Findings - The methanolic extract of raw seed materials contained total free phenolic content of 14.45 +/- 1.62 g catechin equivalent/100 g extract DM.

Further, it also recorded 80.69 percent of alpha-amylase and 63.74 percent of alpha-glucosidase enzyme inhibition characteristics under in vitro starch digestion bioassay. Sprouting + oil-frying caused an apparent increase on the total free phenolic content, antioxidant and free radical scavenging capacity, while soaking + cooking as well as open-pan roasting treatments show diminishing effects.

Via a combination of literature review and stakeholder interaction the options to enhance the sustainability of the use of peat in horticulture in the Netherlands have been studied and discussed. The main outcomes of the study are that to enhance the sustainability one should focus on already degraded peat areas for extraction and transparency in the supply chain should be increased to be able to have a clear and open communication with the public so enhancing the credibility of the sector. In addition research to new extraction methods to upgrade degraded peat and the development of high quality sustainable alternatives for growing media should be continued.

Using assumptions for real household disposable income. real prices, 'exogenous non-economic factors' (ExNEF), average UK temperatures and GHG intensities, three future scenarios are constructed. In each scenario, real expenditure for almost all categories of UK expenditure continues to grow up to 2030: the exceptions being 'alcoholic beverages and tobacco' and 'other fuels' (and 'gas' and 'electricity' in the 'low' scenario) leading to an increase in associated GHG emissions for most of the categories in the 'reference' and 'high' scenarios other than 'food and non-alcoholic beverages', 'alcoholic beverages and tobacco', 'electricity', 'other fuels' and 'recreation and culture'. Of the future GHG emissions, about 30% is attributed to 'direct energy' use by households and nearly 70% attributable to 'indirect energy'. UK policy makers therefore need to consider a range of policies if they wish to curtail emissions associated with household expenditure, including, for example, economic measures such as taxes alongside measures that reflect the important contribution of ExNEF to changes in expenditure for most categories of consumption.

The prioritization of economic growth and economic values is at the root of the systemic failures and resulting crises that America is now experiencing. But an expanding body of evidence is now telling us to think again. Before it is too late, America should begin to move to a post-growth society where working life, the natural environment, our communities, and the public sector are no longer sacrificed for the sake of mere GDP growth, and where the illusory promises of continuous growth no longer provide an excuse for neglecting to deal generously with compelling social needs. Of particular importance for the new economy are government policies that will temper growth while simultaneously improving social and environmental well-being, policies such as shorter work weeks and longer vacations, with more time for children and families, greater labor protections, job security, and benefits, including generous parental leaves, guarantees to part-time workers, restrictions on advertising, a new design for the twenty-first century corporation, incentives for local production and consumption, rigorous environmental, health, and consumer protection, greater economic and social equality, heavy spending on public services and initiatives to address population growth at home and abroad. The best hope for a new political dynamic is a fusion of those concerned about environment, social justice, and political democracy into one progressive force. A unified agenda would embrace a profound commitment to social justice and environmental protection, a sustained challenge to consumerism and commercialism and the lifestyles they offer, a healthy skepticism of growth-mania and a new look at what society should be striving to grow, a challenge to corporate dominance and a redefinition of the corporation and its goals, and a commitment to an array of major pro-democracy reforms.

We argue that any early indications of degrowth would cause the stock market to crash, which would trigger further deleveraging (contagion) and a deflation. As a result, the economy would implode, which would eventually allow for a new rapid growth cycle, given the likely extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy response during the implosion. Thus, in our view, degrowth as an explicit strategy option is economically unsustainable and unfeasible. As a limitation, our analysis centers on the examples of unplanned crisis leading to an economic implosion, which imperfectly represent the idea of planned/voluntary degrowth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most notable changes in the way companies work with sustainability issues is the shift of the focus from own operations to improving the performance of supply chains. This paper aims to analyse the practise of corporate responsibility in the supply chain through the lens of two distinct but related fields of research: Global Value Chain analysis and Supply Chain Management. Using data from two empirical studies that were designed to study the practise of Swedish buyers in addressing social and environmental issues in their respective supply chains, we demonstrate that both fields offer vital insights about how companies can and do exercise environmental and social responsibility in their respective supply chains. We suggest that one can better integrate these two perspectives on governance in the supply chain by acknowledging that responsibility in the supply chain can both be exercised through choice and through inter-organisational management. We discuss role of certification schemes in this context and provide recommendations for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using the 2006 survey data on 377 Chinese manufacturers in six major industrial groups in Suzhou, Dalian, and Tianjin cities, we propose and test a relationship between normative, coercive and mimetic international institutional pressures and the adoption of three important proactive corporate environmental practices (routines) - ISO 14001, TQEM (total quality environmental management), and eco-auditing - by Chinese firms. We also argue for and find that this relationship is greater than that arising from corresponding normative, coercive, and mimetic internal domestic pressures. Finally, we find a positive effect of international parenting or partnering on the adoption of proactive corporate environmental practices and routines.

I use AWIRS-1995, a matched employer-employee survey that reports ample information on the extent of technology and organizational change in Australian workplaces. I find that there is a positive and significant impact of outsourcing on training when I do not control for the correlation between ununobservable factors in these two binary outcomes. However, once I control for this correlation using a bivariate probit estimator, the training impact of outsourcing becomes negative. I then assess the sensitivity of the outsourcing effect to endogeneity by using the method advocated by Altonji et al.

In order to approximate basic numeracy we use age-heaping techniques. We find that Latin America was on a path of convergence with western Europe during the early eighteenth century. During the early nineteenth century, not only did numeracy development stagnate in some Latin American countries but differences among some of them actually increased. While numeracy rates in Argentina, Uruguay, and to a lesser extent Brazil, along with Europe, underwent a significant increase in the late nineteenth century, they declined in Mexico, Ecuador, and Colombia. By performing a regression analysis, we find that, even when we control for investment in education, mass immigration contributed to human capital formation.","[Manzel, Kerstin; Baten, Joerg; Stolz, Yvonne] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Manzel, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",,,", Joerg/0000-0001-5029-501X",,,,,66,29,29,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

To this end, the stochastic frontier technique is used on a unique unbalanced longitudinal dataset comprising top European R&D investors over the period 2000-2005. In this framework, this study quantifies technical inefficiency of individual firms. From a policy perspective, the results of this study suggest that if the aim is to leverage firms' productivity, the emphasis should be put on supporting corporate R&D in high-tech sectors and, to some extent, in medium-tech sectors. On the other hand, corporate R&D in the low-tech sector is found to have a minor effect in explaining productivity. Instead, encouraging investment in fixed assets appears important for the productivity of low-tech industries. Hence, the allocation of support for corporate R&D seems to be as important as its overall increase and an 'erga omnes' approach across all sectors appears inappropriate. However, with regard to technical efficiency, R&D intensity is found to be a pivotal factor in explaining firm efficiency and this turns out to be true for all industries.","[Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13901 USA; [Ortega-Argiles, Raquel] Inst Super Tecn, IN Ctr Innovat Technol & Policy Res, Lisbon, Portugal; [Potters, Lesley] Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vivarelli, Marco] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Vivarelli, Marco] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Voigt, Peter] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Utrecht University; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IZA Institute Labor Economics; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13901 USA.",kkar@binghamton.edu,"Ortega-Argiles, Raquel/HLG-1131-2023; Vivarelli, Marco/AFM-1199-2022; Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/AAG-1944-2020","Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0001-8982-2163; Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/0000-0002-7783-2230; Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0002-8746-9324; VIVARELLI, MARCO/0000-0003-0500-9461",,,,,83,60,67,4,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Production in the shadow economy allows firms to avoid environmental regulation policies; a large informal sector may be accompanied by higher pollution levels. Our theoretical model predicts that controlling the levels of corruption can limit the effect of the shadow economy on pollution. We use panel data covering the period from 1999 to 2005 in more than 100 countries to test this theoretical prediction.

This paper is looking into the governance architecture that is currently in place to regulate GHG emissions from international shipping with a view to analyze whether the institutional degree of fragmentation within this architecture is contributing to the current situation where no legally binding, internationally accepted regulation has been set up yet. Following the hypothesis that the degree and the characteristics of governance fragmentation have a crucial impact on the effectiveness and performance of a governance system, this paper focuses on the current architecture of climate change governance in international shipping and the institutional interplay between its actors. Therefore, the analytical framework builds on approaches from international environmental governance, regime theory, institutional interplay, and fragmentation in international governance architectures.","Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Hackmann, B (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",b.hackmann@uni-oldenburg.de,"Zhang, Rachel/B-6591-2012",,,,,,52,21,23,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

As business attitudes, policies and behaviors regarding biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) progressively change, a better understanding of how business strategies may be framed and implemented is required. In the first part of this paper, we discuss how biodiversity is usually understood as an external environmental constraint on business activities, and how this perception influences arbitrages. We then discuss how assessing BES interdependencies (impacts and dependencies) may bring about new business strategies and needs: we explore the opportunities and challenges of emerging mechanisms of payments for ecosystem services and expose the need for standardized sets of indicators at different scales for the effective management of their BES dependencies and impacts.

In this context, it is important to understand the decision-making behaviour of farmers regarding investments in renewable energy systems that generate energy from biomass and farmers' reactions to investment-support measures. To study this behaviour, we conduct a survey and confront farmers with a hypothetical opportunity to invest in a biogas plant. Our findings reveal that farmers have heterogeneous investment thresholds. Their investment decisions are mainly driven by capital costs and the subjective perception of the risk resulting from the investment. Other decision parameters like sustainability and non-monetary objectives that are also examined in this paper, play only minor roles. However, bounded rationality is an important factor. Moreover, the influence of an investment subsidy was analysed. Only about half of the amount of the subsidy - as expected according to normative forecast models - is reflected in an increased willingness to invest. Furthermore, farmers who have previously invested in bioenergy plants show lower investment thresholds and have stronger reactions to the subsidy. Regarding the expansion of renewable energies these findings are meaningful for policy impact analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the product is elicited using a non-hypothetical economic experiment and then the sensitivity of WTP values is analyzed with regard to additional information provided to participants that includes reference prices, leaflets and tasting. Finally, a sample-selection model is estimated to assess the factors that significantly affect consumers' WTP for the product. Design/methodology/approach - To elicit the willingness to pay a premium for the local food product, 90 subjects were invited to participate in a random nth price experimental auction. Before auctioning the product, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about consumer attitudes and purchase habits. Findings - Only 7 percent of participants are willing to pay a price higher than the minimum price from which the MG product may be purchased directly from a producer or the local producing market. Also, it was found that providing reference prices of substitute products (both conventional and alternative high quality white beans) positively affects WTP for the MG. Interestingly, however, provision of information on organoleptic, nutritional and cooking characteristics of the MG and product tasting do not significantly influence WTP. Finally, the level of consumption, the degree of knowledge about the product and the participants' previous experience increase the purchasing intention for the MG. Originality/value - In contrast to traditional market research studies that use hypothetical methods, the authors use non-hypothetical elicitation mechanism to elicit consumers' valuation for an important local food product in Catalonia, Spain. Since actual products and cash were used in the experiments, the authors provided the respondents with an incentive to reveal their true preferences and valuation for the product of interest. The authors also tested the effect of provision of certain types of information on WTP and analyzed the factors that significantly influence consumers' WTP for the product.","[Akaichi, Faical; Nayga, Rodolfo M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Gil, Jose M.] Univ Politecn Cataluna, CREDA UPC IRTA, Barcelona, Spain",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; IRTA,"Akaichi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",fakaichi@uark.edu,"GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012","GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052; Akaichi, Faical/0000-0003-0395-2368",,,,,30,20,21,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The aim is to discern the impact of EU integration on several variables characterising the marketing and business strategies; to determine the sources of competitive advantage on the domestic market and abroad; and to distinguish the most popular development directions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the author's research study. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted among 780 food-processing companies located in Poland and 30 interviews were conducted with representatives of the industry participating in the International Trade Fair Polagra in Poznan. Findings - There was a systematic growth of export orientation in the study sample after joining the EU. The representatives of the industry usually pointed out either a positive or neutral country-of-origin effect. The crucial sources of competitive advantage differed according to the target market. The importance of quality guarantees and successful branding was much higher in exports, whereas taste and price played a relatively greater role on the domestic market. A growing prevalence of the strategy of backward contractual market channel integration was observed. The findings confirmed the growing attractiveness of internationalisation strategies among Polish food processors after EU accession. Originality/value - The paper provides original insights on the evolution of marketing and business development strategies in Poland after joining the EU. The topic has not been widely discussed at the level of food-processing industry.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey based on interviews with 404 Swiss wine drinkers was conducted. The data were evaluated by means of conjoint and regression analyses. Findings - The organic attribute was more important than the colour of the wine but less important than the price and the country of origin, foreign French wine being preferred to local Swiss wine. Urban and female consumers were relatively likely to consume organic wine, as were consumers who perceive organic wine as being healthy. Practical implications - Marketing for organic wine in well-developed markets should focus on the argument of image and health. Urban female consumers are the most important target group.

Design/methodology/approach - Information collected from pork quality and safety summits sponsored by the National Pork Producers Council in cooperation with the National Pork Board, published surveys of large packers related to contract use, and 15 contracts submitted by producers to the Iowa Attorney General's Office from 1996 to 2001 were examined. The theoretical framework used combines branches of the industrial organization literature. Findings - The paper provides information documenting the growing importance of addressing pork quality problems in the 1990s and how marketing contracts between packers and producers can help address these problems. Recognizes their role in reducing transaction costs associated with carcass pricing programs, reducing pork quality measuring costs, providing quality control, and reducing costs of adapting to quality uncertainty. Research limitations/implications - The list of contracts examined is a small collection of contracts voluntarily submitted by producers, and pertains to a specific geographic section of the USA. Thus, they may not be representative of the entire industry. Practical implications - The paper provides background information on quality issues faced by the US pork industry and a framework for better understanding the potential role of marketing contracts in addressing these issues. Originality/value - This paper provides rather unique institutional background information on important changes occurring in the US pork industry in the 1990s and the role of the growth in marketing contracts in addressing related pork quality issues over time. Given the proprietary nature of specific contract terms, a small sample of long-term marketing contracts is analyzed to better understand contract design.","Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Martinez, SW (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA.",martinez@ers.usda.gov,"Martinez, Steve/HTP-7560-2023",,,,,,49,3,4,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Means-end chain approach is used. Laddering interviews are conducted with consumers in Norway, Denmark, Hungary and Slovakia. Findings - Consumers in this study did recognize and appreciate the benefits that HPP and PEF apple juice have to offer over a juice produced by pasteurization. The respondents in all four countries associated positive consequences with product attributes related to the nutritional value and the taste of the products produced by means of these novel technologies. Also the environmental benefits from processing foods by applying these technologies were seen as highly positive characteristics of the technologies. However, many respondents also expressed some scepticism, especially towards the PEF treated juice and were unsure about if there were risks associated with consuming products processed by this technology. Practical implications - When new processing technologies are introduced, consumer acceptance is one of the key issues for their future success. It is up to food producers and food scientists to provide the evidence that will convince consumers that these new technologies are safe to use.

Previous conditions, like separability, must hold for meaningful first- stage efficiency estimates and second-stage regression. After some confusion in the literature, Simar and Wilson (J Prod Anal 36(2):205-218, 2011b) clarify that their work of 2007 actually defines a statistical model where truncated (but not censored, i.e., Tobit, not Ordinary Least Square) regression yields a consistent estimation of model features. They demonstrate that conventional, likelihood-based approaches to inference are invalid, and they develop a bootstrap approach that yields valid inference in second stage regressions when these are appropriate. The results reveal a significant relation between efficiency and all the variables analysed and that municipalities governed by progressive parties are more efficient.","[Benito, Bernardino; Moreno, Maria-Rocio] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Solana, Jose] Def Univ Ctr, Dept Integrat, San Javier Air Base 30720, San Javier, Spain",University of Murcia,"Benito, B (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",benitobl@um.es; jose.solana@cud.upct.es; mrmoreno@um.es,"SOLANA IBAÑEZ, JOSE/E-5156-2010; Benito, Bernardino/K-9416-2014","SOLANA IBAÑEZ, JOSE/0000-0003-4269-4592; Benito, Bernardino/0000-0003-2165-994X",,,,,124,38,39,0,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

To cope with the interactions between socio-economic factors and the roles of multiple participants, criteria and alternatives the paper proposes the use of a fuzzy multi-criteria model. The fuzzy methodology forms the basis for the development of a composite fuzzy risk index for prioritizing different regions in Iran.

Strong detrimental relationships often form between pest populations and other biota, damaging ecosystem services and reducing social welfare. Under these circumstances, optimal pest management must account for the interactions between pests and other species. The bioeconomic model of competition developed in this manuscript is illustrated using the case of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) on Santa Cruz Island, California. The presence of the pigs, an introduced species, resulted in the near extirpation of the native island fox (Urocyon littoralis) before managers intervened and removed the pigs from the island. The application compares a policy of pig eradication with one of perpetual control, which is found to involve initially over-culling the pigs relative to the equilibrium level. To protect the foxes of Santa Cruz Island, the results suggest that pig eradication rather than pig control is the optimal strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Estimating direct and indirect rebound effects for different UK socioeconomic groups,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rebound effect; Income effects; Re-spending; Household expenditure,ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; EFFICIENCY; IMPACTS,"This study estimates the combined direct and indirect rebound effects from various types of energy efficiency improvement and behavioural change by UK households and explores how these effects vary with total expenditure. The methodology is based upon estimates of the expenditure elasticity and GHG intensity of 16 categories of goods and services, and allows for the capital cost and embodied emissions of the energy efficiency measures themselves. The study finds that rebound effects, in GHG terms, are modest (0-32%) for measures affecting domestic energy use, larger (25-65%) for measures affecting vehicle fuel use and very large (66-106%) for measures that reduce food waste. Furthermore, measures undertaken by low income households are associated with the largest rebound effects, with direct emissions forming a larger proportion of the total rebound effect for those households. Measures that are subsidised or affect highly taxed energy commodities may be less effective in reducing aggregate emissions.

However, there remains some doubt about the universality and utility of the terminology used to describe these services. Public preferences for ecosystem service terminology were elicited using an online survey (n = 145) of adults in the UK and other countries. A list of different ecosystem phenomena was provided and respondents identified each as a benefit, function, good and/or service. Results were generally robust to subjective differences in familiarity with the subject matter. In the overall sample, benefit was the most preferred descriptor followed by function, service and good. However, by using a combination of non-parametric statistical tests, 10 descriptor sets emerged from the data to describe 22 different ecosystem phenomena. Three of these descriptor sets were individual words (benefit, function and good), covering 9 of the 22 ecosystem phenomena. The other 7 descriptor sets were multiple words (e.g. benefit-good and benefit-function-service) covering the remaining 13 ecosystem phenomena. Scoring the 22 ecosystem phenomena in terms of 4 characteristics (intake, solid, survive and visible) yielded mixed results in terms of being able to distinguish between descriptor sets based on the presence or absence of these characteristics.

In places where drought is a major driver of agroecosystem dynamics, as in the extensive livestock grazing systems that dominate Africa's sprawling arid and semi-arid lands, changing rainfall variability can fundamentally alter human wealth dynamics. We use subjective livestock herd growth expectations data elicited from Boran pastoralists in southern Ethiopia to generate estimates of herd dynamics conditional on rainfall state. The climate state-conditional estimates permit simulation of herd dynamics under different rainfall patterns. The multiple herd size equilibria observed in multiple pastoralist household data sets from the region appear sensitive to climate regimes. Reduced rainfall variability that significantly reduces drought frequency would eliminate, in expectation, the poverty trap equilibrium that presently exists only for households with herd sizes beneath a threshold level. Conversely, if the drought frequency more than doubles relative to recent patterns, then the whole system becomes a poverty trap, in expectation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As payments could not be enforced through third parties, sovereigns had to convince lenders of their commitment to service their loans. Although the literature has dealt with this problem extensively, little is known about what supported lending in early modern Europe. This article therefore asks whether and how commitment mechanisms identified in the sovereign borrowing literature made external borrowing safer in early modern Europe. It attempts to answer this question by analysing the loans that a small and peripheral state (Denmark) issued in Europe's foremost international investment hub (eighteenth-century Holland). Primary sources demonstrate that Denmark inspired confidence in investors and serviced its loans well; a new dataset with securities prices reveals yields to maturity in accordance with this. Economic spillovers (domestic economic damage) and reputation (loss of access to external loans) are identified as the mechanisms that kept the Danish sovereigns committed to honouring their debts. The Danish case shows, however, that these commitment mechanisms could only be adopted after the growth and integration of northern Europe's economies. This suggests that commitment mechanisms are not as universally applicable as the literature often seems to claim.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"van Bochove, C (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,115,5,5,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Firstly, the existing intervals in the literature do not correspond to the minimum width intervals and in this paper we discuss how to compute such intervals and how they either include or exclude zero as a lower bound depending on where the probability mass of the distribution of resides. This has useful implications for practitioners and policy makers, with greatest reductions in interval width for the most efficient firms. Secondly, we propose an 'asymptotic' approach to incorporating parameter uncertainty into prediction intervals for firm specific inefficiency (given that in practice model parameters have to be estimated) as an alternative to the 'bagging' procedure suggested in Simar and Wilson (Econom Rev 29(1):62-98, 2010). The approach is computationally much simpler than the bagging approach.","[Wheat, Phill; Smith, Andrew] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Greene, William] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY USA",University of Leeds; New York University,"Wheat, P (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, 36-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",p.e.wheat@its.leeds.ac.uk,,"WHEAT, PHILL/0000-0003-0659-5052",,,,,28,5,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Collecting and burning firewood requires a considerable amount of time, has negative health consequences, and can cause deforestation and depletion of local resources if forests are not properly managed. A transition from traditional to modern fuels can benefit households by reducing these negative effects. Migration, a quintessential feature of development, may facilitate this transition, but its impacts on fuel choice are theoretically ambiguous. It can reduce the household labor available for firewood collection and provide cash to purchase substitutes; however, it has an income effect that changes the demand for home-cooked food and energy to cook it. Firewood or gas could be used to meet the increase in energy demand. To resolve this theoretical ambiguity, we use an instrumental-variables method with household panel data from rural Mexico and investigate the impact of Mexico-to-US migration and remittances on gas expenditures and household labor allocated to firewood collection. Sending a migrant to the United States causes a significant decrease in reliance on firewood collection and an increase in both stove and gas purchases. These findings have potentially far-reaching environmental implications as labor moves off the farm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We examine this trade-off in the context of the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). The fishery derives its revenue from different prawn species with different dynamics and recruitment processes. A multi-species bio-economic and stochastic model is used to examine the trade-offs between mean profitability of the fishery and its variance, under a range of economic scenarios, fishing capacities and distributions of fishing effort across the various sub-fisheries that comprise the NPF. Simulation results show that the current fishing strategy diversifying catch across sub-components of the fishery entails a compromise between expected performance and risk. Furthermore, given the current economic conditions, increases in fleet size would improve the expected economic performance of the fishery, but at the cost of increased variability of this performance.

Previous research has also argued that they were equally important for the German stock market. This article provides quantitative and qualitative evidence that although the market for underwriters was dominated by a small oligopoly of six large banks, there was still perceptible competition, which kept fees and short-run profits low. Another interesting finding presented here is the absence of a signalling effect to investors. Neither underpricing nor the one-year performance was different for the IPOs issued by one of the Big Six. Thus, although the German IPO business was in the hands of a small oligopoly, investors did not benefit from the lack of competition. One explanation is that the quality of IPOs on the German stock market of the time was very good in general as a result of the competition between underwriters, but also as a result of the tight regulation of underwriting, which ensured the quality of all firms on the German stock market.","Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Lehmann, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany.",,,"Lehmann-Hasemeyer, Sibylle/0000-0002-5645-5923",,,,,61,18,18,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The method constitutes an ordinary least squares estimation (OLS) of a polynomial model, which is derived from defined stationary points on the basis of polynomial factorization and integral transform. The method is applied to de-trended seasonally adjusted time series. It suggests a simple model for the cyclical component, which allows to incorporate any definition of business cycle in econometric calculations, thus providing an alternative to the commonly used filters (such as the moving average) and simplifies decomposing of time series into individual components. Its drawback is however computational effort linked to higher degrees of polynomials in long time series. The method is tested on the definition of business cycle employed by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) on the U.S. annual and quarterly gross domestic product data, 1947-2013.","Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bolotov, I (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",Ilya.bolotov@vse.cz,"Bolotov, Ilya I/L-5695-2013; Bolotov, Ilya/I-9483-2019","Bolotov, Ilya/0000-0003-1148-7144",,,,,13,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,151,160,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700015,0

It is an ongoing historical process, which has recently been fuelled by the new issue of cultured meat. Design/methodology/approach - Starting from Goody's developmentalist stages (Production, Distribution, Preparation and Consumption), first this work analyses historically how these stages have undergone the process of the disappearance of the animal origins of meat (animal origins of meat are parts like the head and legs that remind us that once meat was an animal). Second, this paper applies cultured meat to Goody's stage of Production, linking the new product to the historical, above described, process. Findings - The analysis shows that, in the past, Goody's stages of Consumption, Distribution and Preparation witnessed the disappearance of the animal origins of meat, while Production was not affected by the phenomenon. Today, with testing on cultured meat, even the stage of Production has gone through this process. Now, all of Goody's stages are involved in the process. Usually considered a shocking novelty, cultured meat is instead a stage of a historical process. Originality/value - No one has previously analysed the disappearance of the animal origins of meat relating it to Goody's stages, and a current issue like cultured meat has never been considered a further step of this process.","Queen Margaret Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Queen Margaret University,"Buscemi, F (通讯作者)，Queen Margaret Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",FBuscemi@qmu.ac.uk,,"Buscemi, Francesco/0000-0002-8315-8924",,,,,58,9,11,2,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The main task of bankruptcy models is to provide a relatively quick answer if an examined corporation has high risk of bankruptcy or not. It should provide key relevant data for evaluator decision making. The economic environment is changing and therefore there is a need for creating new tools and methods predicting financial distress of evaluated entities. Using information technologies and various statistical programmes which were not available before there can be constructed plenty of models. On the other hand, these models should fulfil some requirements otherwise they will not provide reliable answers and they will not help their users in their business decision making. This paper is focused on requirements which each model predicting financial distress should meet. These requirements are collected from the relevant literature as well as they are created as author's opinion based on the critique of existing approaches.

Design/methodology/approach - A sample survey among a random sample of 932 households living in the region of Thessaly, central Greece, was carried out, with the consuming behaviour to be focused on 20 basic food products. An exploratory factor analysis, followed by a hierarchical classification of the households, was implemented. Findings - Six patterns of food consumption's behaviour have been detected, revealing that most of the households have modified their eating habits, by reducing the quantities consumed and/or looking for less expensive brands. Only 15 per cent of the households do not seem to be affected by the crisis and the austerity policy. The spatial dimension of the research signify that low-income households in urban areas, where the majority of the population lives, are deeply affected by the crisis, with these percentages to be even higher at semi-urban and rural areas.

It requires a multi disciplinary expertise, encompassing a diversity of core competencies that include mainly strategic planning and logistics design; process engineering and analysis; facilities design and automation; systems design, integration, and implementation and material handling technology. When designing or optimizing an intralogistics system a model of the processes and products is often required. In contrast to traditional process systems where artefacts with physical and chemical interactions are the key constituents, intralogistics systems similarly to supply chains are best thought of as socio-technical systems where complex production technologies interact with distributed, intelligent, autonomous entities. My personal experience with supply chain modelling and optimisation shows that better than the application of a set of balance equations similar in structure to those used to model for example chemical processes is to adopt an alternative modelling paradigm when dealing with supply chain dynamics. This new paradigm is called agent-based modelling. The aim of this article is to describe an application of agent-based modelling in a real intralogistics system design and optimisation. The system consists of a warehouse ensuring storing and dispatch of products coming from machinery industry. With help of an agent-based model realized in Witness dynamic simulation environment the internal organization of warehouse is designed and optimized taking into account planned 10-100 % material flow intensity increase per year. The outputs of the simulation support mainly the decisions about optimal warehouse layout; warehouse storage and material handling equipment and warehouse management system.","Prague Inst Chem Technol, Prague 16628 6, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Dyntar, J (通讯作者)，Prague Inst Chem Technol, Prague 16628 6, Czech Republic.",jakub.dyntar@vscht.cz,"Dyntar, Jakub/HDN-5719-2022","Dyntar, Jakub/0000-0002-5927-9443",,,,,10,7,7,0,13,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,374,384,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700037,0

The aim of the paper will be to show how mortality rates are improving over the time, and gradually are improving mortality rates in middle-aged groups and shift to higher age groups. Consequently the life expectancy at birth and 65-year-old people are prolonging. Differences between life expectancy of x-year-old person and modal age of death are reducing. There is a further ageing of population.","Univ Econ, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Langhamrová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",xlanj18@vse.cz,"Vrabcová, Jana/G-6312-2015",,,,,,15,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,807,816,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700079,0

From 1993 to 2012 the Czech Republic produced only quarterly, not monthly data. The monthly unemployment rate was calculated for the purpose of Eurostat from quarterly results and administrative sources (registered unemployment rate from The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs). The Czech Republic started with the monthly processing of LFS data in 2012. At present, thirteen member states obtain monthly unemployment estimates directly from the LFS as the only source. Before implementing the regular monthly data processing there were several options. Three basic methods are used in the current methodology of monthly processing: a direct calculation from the raw LFS data applying the same methodology as the quarterly processing, the three-month moving average using the last available three months and regression composite estimation. The analysis showed that regression composite estimation is the most suitable variant for monthly processing in the Czech Republic.","Univ Econ, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Nyvlt, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",ondrej.nyvlt@czso.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1074,1082,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700105,0

The case is studied from the viewpoint of an interpretive paradigm. This article concentrates on constructing the critical elements that led to a food development project failure. The plan was to have a traditional Finnish dish updated and introduced as a mass produced high-end convenience food. The project included new convenience food development, packaging design, consumer market research and a sensory study to back up the food product development on behalf of a newly established company. Theoretical grounds for the case are based on the new product development (NPD) research process in the food sector. Design/methodology/approach - The method applied is an explorative single within-case study. The research data were mainly obtained from qualitative materials that ranged from marketing plans to case study field notes compiled by the researchers. Quantitative data were also obtained from various types of materials but to a lesser extent. Findings - The results of the study show that the failure of new product development was connected to the factors identified in classic NPD research. In addition, five phenomena that contributed to product development failure were constructed: path-dependency; information condensations; the illusion of mutual knowledge and understanding; practices of problem definition; and window-of-opportunity effects. The results are presented in a form of analytical generalisation that can be applied, with certain restrictions, to other contexts for new food product development. Originality/value - Failure rates of NPD have remained the same for the last 30 years in the food sector. Failed NPD projects can be valuable assets for the food industry when properly analysed. Examination of successful NPD projects has provided valuable lists of success factors, but knowledge on phenomena having an effect on NPD failure is needed.","[Ryynanen, Toni] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland; [Hakatie, Annaleena] Verso Finland Ltd, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Ryynänen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland.",toni.ryynanen@helsinki.fi,,"Ryynanen, Toni/0000-0002-3710-5311",,,,,29,14,18,0,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In order to promote industrial structure optimization, developing countries should establish self-development value network through reconstruction of value chain, supply chain and industry chain, which can deepen division and take the initiative of optimizing industrial structure. Native system integration enterprises are dominant in the course of industrial structure optimization, which select appropriate products to form new comparative advantage and accumulate resource and capability, then lay the foundation of competitive advantage. During the course of industrial structure optimization, the government should provide supporting policies in accordance with enterprise strategy development, and encourage system integration enterprises to launch product and technology upgrading. As a typical case study of internalization, Huawei plays the pivotal role in researching reconstruction of value network, cultivation of system integration enterprise's capability as well as industrial structure optimization.","[Shu, Xing; Huo, Wei-Dong] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,,365907095@qq.com; horsehwd@foxmail.com,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",1951-6851,,978-94-6252-008-0,ADV INTEL SYS RES,,,2014,107.0,,,,,,185,189,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BB0ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340893200032,0

Design/methodology/approach - The aim of this study is to identify perceptions, attitudes and behavior of young adults concerning wine consumption, using the theory of planned behavior as a theoretical framework. Findings - The major findings are that attitudes and subjective norms are, apparently, the components with most influence on behavior of young people in relation to wine consumption. For the consumers group, attitudes seem to be the most crucial component, especially the interest in alcohol. They drink it in special occasions for sociability and to disinhibit. Regarding the non-consumers group, the main attitude is dislike taste. Also the subjective norms, are very present, especially parents, society, friends and publicity, in consumers group. The non-consumers have the perception of greater parental induction to not consume wine. No significant differences were found between gender or educational system. Research limitations/implications - Concerning the results, a limited, convenience sample, was employed and this is assumedly an exploratory study. Therefore the results cannot be considered to represent a broad section of the groups studied. Still sample related, only Portuguese young adults students were studied. Social implications - This research can contribute not only for the knowledge relating to Portugal as a wine consuming environment but also to the general area of attitudes and perceptions of young people towards moderate wine consumption. As today young adults, novice or potential wine consumers will be the next generation of wine consumers, it can be beneficial for wine marketers to focus on this target population aiming at exploring further their engagement with wine. Originality/value - This research has an originally approach to wine consumption by young adults once it focus and explore the non-problematic behavior of young adults about wine consumption. The results of this study can contribute to the development of targeted advertising and publicity of the wine industry, in order to promote moderate wine consumption among young adults.","[Silva, Ana Patricia; Figueiredo, Isabel; Hogg, Tim] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Escola Super Biotecnol, Porto, Portugal; [Sottomayor, Miguel] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Escola Super Biotecnol, Fac Econ & Gestao, Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Silva, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Escola Super Biotecnol, Porto, Portugal.",apsilva@porto.ucp.pt,"Hogg, Tim/JXY-0365-2024","Hogg, Tim/0000-0003-2017-4131",,,,,36,29,34,3,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

William Kapp; Niklas Luhmann; Social costs; Open systems; Autopoiesis; Sustainability,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS; SYSTEMS-THEORY; POLICY; PERSPECTIVE,"In developing his famous theory of social costs, K. William Kapp claimed to draw inspiration from the theory of open systems. The present paper reconstructs the notion of social costs from the perspective of the Luhmannian theory of autopoietic social systems, an alternative systems-theoretic paradigm. According to Luhmann, these systems build up their internal complexity at the cost of lowering their sensitivity to the complexity of their environment, both societal and ecological. From the Luhmannian perspective, social costs can be understood as those segments of environmental feedback that are thus ignored by social systems. This perspective is not only consistent with Kapp's own vision of social costs as a systematic outcome of private business enterprise, but also even more radical as it traces these costs back to the regime of functional differentiation of society, and thus to human civilization generally. It follows from the Luhmannian perspective that social costs can be reduced by improving the coordination between the individual functional systems, such as economy, law, politics, and science.

In their theoretical analysis, the authors address the basic relations of the legal regulation and self-regulation of advertising based on codes of conduct. They define the possible benefits and risks associated with self-regulation of advertising. In doing so they try to make legal regulation and self-regulation overlap. This critical viewpoint provides for a theoretical prediction of ways of misusing self-regulation of advertising, in particular with respect to a strategic protection against illegal advertising practices. Based on a specific advertisement by Jogobella-Zott transmitted in the Czech Republic in 2007 the authors point out at a suspicious procedure of an arbiter of self-regulation while evaluating a possibly misleading advertisement. Subsequently, they extend their analysis to discuss the binding force of rules included in codes of conduct and the possibility of enforcing these before a law court.","[Vavrecka, Jan; Stepanek, Petr] Univ Econ, Dept Business, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Vavrecka, Jan; Stepanek, Petr] Univ Econ, European Law Fac Int Relat, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vavrecka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Business, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jan.vavrecka@seznam.cz; stepanek@vse.cz,,,,,,,13,1,1,1,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1574,1587,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700154,0

Decision-making documents in the Supreme Court and in one specific case of a bauxite mining conflict involving Vedanta in the Niyamgiri hills are studied to come to conclusions about how economic valuation of forests has moved through the political process. We argue that establishing NPV for forests is neither conducive to conservation nor to environmental justice for the following three reasons. The technical and political process of setting prices deepens and reproduces structural inequalities with negative distributive effects. NPV encourages economistic decision-making procedures that exclude participation. Finally NPV does not recognize or take into account cultural difference or plural values. We thus conclude that economic valuation of forest products and services has not managed to save forests in India and is not an effective or viable strategy for expressing the value of forests or for environmental conservation and environmental justice activism.

The development of market-based instruments for biodiversity conservation has been receiving increased attention as a possible cheaper and more effective alternative to the global regulatory approach. The implementation of such instruments is particularly challenging in post-socialist countries, where the former state command-and-control economy disturbed the normal functioning of markets. Our analysis indicates that market-based instruments can increase the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation, but are not always suitable and appropriate. The following preconditions for the effective design of market-based instruments in CEE countries have been identified: clear property rights and decision making structure, transparent rules for information dissemination, and monitoring responsibilities. Our results show that the successful implementation of market-based instruments for biodiversity conservation in CEE countries is furthermore influenced by pre-existing formal and informal institutions, in which reputation and trust may play a role. However, market-based instruments should complement rather than substitute regulatory approaches, and in combination with traditional regulation, such can become critical in achieving the objectives of biodiversity conservation.

This article examines the energy funding of different international organizations, with a particular focus on the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) and International Finance Corporation (IFC). We use data on 888 projects in 128 recipient countries funded by nine major international organizations during the years 2008-2011. Relative to other organizations, the IDA is found to invest less in fossil fuels and more in projects that improve energy access for the poorest people. The IFC emphasizes fossil fuels while downplaying the importance of energy access. Overall, fossil fuels now receive only a minority of energy funding. However, energy access is only emphasized in a tiny minority of projects.","[Kim, Sung Eun; Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 420 West 118th St,712 Int Affairs Bldg, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,"Kim, Sung Eun/AAY-1989-2021; Kim, Sung Eun/GZM-6217-2022","Kim, Sung Eun/0000-0001-6799-4343; Kim, Sung Eun/0000-0001-6799-4343",,,,,18,8,10,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Rational agents are supposed to consider the cost and benefits of cooperation, which then determine their negotiation positions. Behavioral economics provides experimental evidence that decision-making in negotiation-like situations is influenced by systematic cognitive biases and social interaction. In this paper, we examine the impact of bounded rationality and social preferences on bargaining in international climate negotiations and illustrate how particular deviations from full rationality affect the incentives to cooperate. Of special interest are fairness preferences for burden-sharing rules and behavioral responses to different framings of climate change and policy, as well as implications of these for communication about climate change. The analysis will further address different levels of representation, including individual citizens, politicians, experts, and (professional) negotiators. The consequences of the most prominent nonstandard preferences and biases for negotiating a climate treaty are assessed, and specific strategies to foster cooperation are suggested.","[Gsottbauer, Elisabeth; van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

Understanding how these factors contribute to high drug prices will allow players in this supply chain to negotiate more favorable contract terms. This can be a large benefit to society as this insight can lead to improved efficiency in pricing and increased savings, which can be passed to the consumer. We develop measures for these factors based on publicly available information. Using data on the wholesale prices of prescription drugs, we estimate a model for drug prices based on our measures of competition, therapeutic purpose, age, and manufacturer. Our analysis reveals that these factors are significant in estimating drug prices. We observe that proliferation of dosing levels tends to reduce the prices, therapeutic conditions which are both less common and more life-threatening lead to higher prices, older drugs are less expensive than newer drugs, and some manufacturers set prices systematically different from others even after controlling for other factors. These findings indicate that publicly observable factors can be used to explain drug prices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reviews the studies that have tried to estimate the value of forest ecosystem services. Broadly, this study addresses the following questions: (1) What insights do these studies provide on the value of forest ecosystems? (2) What lessons do they offer from an economic and policy perspective? (3) What are the shortcomings of the existing studies, and what are the challenges and issues for future research? Evidence from a cross section of forest sites, countries and regions suggests that not only the total valuation of ecosystem services varies widely across studies but also the valuation of individual services. This variation suggests that policies to conserve ecosystems and their services should emphasise local contexts and values. This paper concludes by discussing the shortcomings of existing studies, and suggests that, among other things, future research should focus on the neglected ecosystem services, 'disservices', assess the role of dynamic factors and environmental catastrophes on the provision of ecosystem services, and assess the benefits of keeping forests intact versus converting them to alternative uses.

Their diagnosis as incidental findings of ever-more-sensitive medical imaging can leave patients and physicians in something of a quandary. The patient feels well, and potential interventions to stave off long-term deterioration or death bring with them immediate risks. We discuss the use of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model (rather than Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov Model) to create a tool for analyzing individual treatment decisions for asymptomatic chronic diseases where a patient's condition cannot improve. We formulate a finitehorizon MDP model to determine optimal treatment plans and discuss three distinct optimality criteria: (a) maximizing expected quality-adjusted-life years with and without discounting, (b) maximizing the expected number of life years in good health, and (c) maximizing the expected utility for number of years in good health. In (c) we assume exponential utility and consider different risk aversion factors reported in the medical literature. We illustrate the model's use by considering asymptomatic intracranial aneurysm. Our model builds on a simulation model [19] created to examine treatment recommendations based on cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate that incorporating risk aversion leads to no treatment recommendations for some types of aneurysm. Furthermore, the use of alternate patient-selected criteria leads to recommendations that vary from [19] in several scenarios. We also discuss the use of the software as a decision support tool to help make individualized treatment recommendations and demonstrate that the computational performance of the algorithm makes its use feasible during a short office visit.

To do this we use hedonic pricing to explore the impact of water rights on property values in 151 agricultural land transactions that occurred between 2001 and 2005. We test two main hypotheses: (1) that the marginal willingness to pay for water rights is higher in more developed urbanizing areas than in less developed rural areas, and (2) that the marginal willingness to pay for water rights in urban areas is increasing in the value of developed land. We find that the marginal willingness to pay for water rights is highest among properties in urbanized or urbanizing areas where a significant proportion of the land has already been developed.

Using 69 studies, offering 547 estimations, we shed light on why EKC results differ. We investigate the incidence of choices made by authors (such as econometric strategy, measure of deforestation, geographical area, and presence of control variables) on the probability of finding an EKC. After a phase of work corroborating the EKC, we find a turning point after the year 2001.

Combining Modern Portfolio Theory and a new data set comprising assets listed on the Paris and London Stock Exchanges, we show that investing in the New World did not yield higher returns than investing in Europe. The European preference of the Paris Bourse and, by extension, of French investors was not inefficient.","[Edlinger, Cecile] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, UMR 7522, BETA, Nancy, France; [Merli, Maxime] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LaRGE Res Ctr, Strasbourg, France; [Parent, Antoine] LET, IEP Lyon, CNRS, UMR 5593, Lyon, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Edlinger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, CNRS, UMR 7522, BETA, Nancy, France.",edlinger.cecile@hotmail.fr; merli@unistra.fr; antoine.parent@sciencespo-lyon.fr,,"PARENT, Antoine/0000-0001-5087-9488",,,,,53,13,15,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

Using unbalanced panel data analysis, we study how pesticide over- or under-use varies for countries with different per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and foreign direct investment (FDI) stock. We begin by controlling for climatic and agricultural variables that should lead to variation in pesticide application rates. The residual from the regression provides an indication of a nation's deviation in pesticide use relative to the mean. The more negative the residual, the more likely it is that that nation is under-using pesticides. The more positive it is, the more likely it is that pesticides are being over-used. We study the correlation of this residual with important economic and political variables. We find that at low levels of per capita GDP, there is evidence of pesticide under-use and that at the highest income levels, there may be increasing over-use. We also look at the correlation of pesticide use with foreign direct investment stock, farm size, mechanization and democracy and, in most cases find significant correlation with these variables.

This period includes the boom and bust cycle of the early 1920s as well as the Great Depression of the early 1930s. The events of the early 1920s are particularly intriguing, involving inflation running at an annual rate of 30 percent followed by a period of sharp deflation where nominal wages and prices fell by 30 percent and unemployment increased from 5 to 30 percent. We examine whether relatively standard wage and employment equations can account for the volatile economic development during the interwar years. By and large, the answer is a qualified yes. Industry wages were responsive to industry-specific firm performance, suggesting a significant role for insider forces in wage determination. Unemployment had a strong downward impact on wages. There is evidence that reductions in working time added to wage pressure; yet, estimates of labor demand equations suggest that cuts in working time may have slightly increased employment as firms substituted workers for hours per worker.","[Holmlund, Bertil] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Holmlund, Bertil] Uppsala Univ, UCLS, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University; Uppsala University,"Holmlund, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",bertil.holmlund@nek.uu.se,,,,,,,52,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2013,7.0,2,,,,,131,159,,10.1007/s11698-012-0084-9,0.0,,,29,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,133XO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318174400002,0

However, PES have raised some concerns on the commodification of nature and the potential replacement of non-chrematistic forms of valuing ecosystems. This article evaluates PES and ICDPs in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, by analyzing the programs' fund allocation, examining conservation perceptions based on 731 structured interviews and presenting a detailed assessment of ICDP/PES preferences in a community with the longest participation in both schemes. People receiving PES tend to make the future of conservation contingent on monetary and utilitarian reasons, this preference increasing with the number of years receiving PES. These are preferred for their directness and short-term results, although raising concerns about the little social capital they generate. ICDPs are appreciated for arising environmental awareness, being linked with long term conservation, productive capacity and social capital building. Negative perceptions of ICDPs are related to past economic failures. Our results suggest that the real issue is not PES vs. ICDPs but how to combine them to find the proper sequence while reinforcing intrinsic value-based attitudes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates conservation values of major DMZ resources and comparatively tests distance decay between contingent valuation and choice modelling. The overall conservation value for the DMZ resources per person as one-off payments was $9.06 or $34.97, respectively from the CVM and CM datasets. Research findings deny distance decay regardless of elicitation methods when the distance variable is parameterised as part of utility functions. Conversely, a segmentation-valuation approach demonstrates conflicting conclusions on distance decay and the WTP anomaly between users and non-users depending on elicitation methods. The CM results demonstrate that protection of the DMZ resources might be less important and attractive to local populations than to those in the distant regions. A direct cross-method transfer of any distance effect might not be granted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper seeks to assess financial protection in health in the particular policy and epidemiological transition of Tunisia using nationally representative survey data on healthcare expenditure, utilization and morbidity. The extent to which the healthcare system protects people against the financial repercussions of ill-health is assessed using the catastrophic and impoverishing payment approaches. The characteristics associated with the likelihood of vulnerability to catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) are examined using multivariate logistic regression technique. Results revealed that non-negligible proportions of the Tunisian population (ranging from 4.5 % at the conservative 40 % threshold of discretionary nonfood expenditure to 12 % at the 10 % threshold of total expenditure) incurred CHE. In terms of impoverishment, results showed that health expenditure can be held responsible for about 18 % of the rise in the poverty gap. These results appeared to be relatively higher when compared with those obtained for other countries with similar level of development. Nonetheless, although households belonging to richer quintiles reported more illness episodes and received more treatment than the poor households, the latter households were more likely to incur CHE at any threshold. Amongst the correlates of CHE, health insurance coverage was significantly related to CHE regardless of the threshold used. Some implications and policy recommendations, which might also be useful for other similar countries, are advanced to enhance the financial protection capacity of the Tunisian healthcare system.","[Abu-Zaineh, Mohammad; Ventelou, Bruno; Moatti, Jean-Paul] INSERM IRD UMR 912 SESSIM, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Abu-Zaineh, Mohammad; Moatti, Jean-Paul] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ AMSE, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Ben Romdhane, Habiba] Fac Med, Cardiovasc Dis Res Lab, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ventelou, Bruno] Aix Marseille Sch Econ AMSE, Res Grp Quantitat Econ Aix Marseille CNRS GREQAM, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Chokri, Arfa] Univ Carthage Tunis, Natl Inst Labour & Social Studies INTES, Tunis, Tunisia",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Faculte de Medecine de Tunis (FMT); Universite de Carthage,"Abu-Zaineh, M (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ AMSE, F-13006 Marseille, France.",mohammad.abu-zaineh@inserm.fr,"Abu-Zaineh, Mohammad/G-7121-2018; ABU-ZAINEH, Mohammad/Y-4716-2019","Abu-Zaineh, Mohammad/0000-0001-8888-432X;",,,,,57,24,25,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Informal water businesses fulfill unmet water supply needs, yet little is understood about this sector. This paper presents data gathered from quantitative interviews with informal water business operators (n = 260) in Kisumu, Kenya, collected during the dry season. Sales volume, location, resource use, and cost were analyzed by using material flow accounting and spatial analysis tools. Estimates show that over 76% of the city's water is consumed by less than 10% of the population who have water piped into their dwellings. The remainder of the population relies on a combination of water sources, including water purchased directly from kiosks (1.5 million m(3) per day) and delivered by hand-drawn water-carts (0.75 million m(3) per day). Energy audits were performed to compare energy use among various water sources in the city. Water delivery by truck is the highest per cubic meter energy demand (35 MJ/m(3)), while the city's tap water has the highest energy use overall (21,000 MJ/day). We group kiosks by neighborhood and compare sales volume and cost with neighborhood-level population data. Contrary to popular belief, we do not find evidence of price gouging; the lowest prices are charged in the highest-demand low-income area. We also see that the informal sector is sensitive to demand, as the number of private boreholes that serve as community water collection points are much larger where demand is greatest.

This paper addresses this important omission by examining whether firms respond to immigration by expanding their production activities within a city in order to utilize the abundant supply of low-skilled workers. Using data on immigration and the universe of establishments in U.S. cities, the results indicate that firms respond to immigration at the extensive margin by increasing the number of establishments. Not surprisingly, immigration has a more positive impact on the number of establishments that are small in size and in relatively mobile, low-skill intensive industries. Additional evidence indicates that immigration has little impact on employment within existing establishments, the intensive margin, or on the number of establishments in service industries which may expand simply due to immigrant consumption.","Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Olney, WW (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",william.olney@williams.edu,,,,,,,27,29,36,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Plants were grown with a complete modified Hoagland's all-nitrate solution (macronutrient concentrations in mM) 15 NO3-N, 1.0 PO4-P, 6.0 K, 5.0 Ca, 2.0 Mg, and 2.0 SO4-S plus (micronutrient concentrations in. M) 72 Fe, 18 Mn, 3 Cu, 3 Zn, 45 B, and 0.1 Mo. Nutrient-deficiency treatments were induced with a complete nutrient formula minus one of the nutrients. Reagent grade chemicals and deionized water of 18-megohms purity were used to formulate treatment solutions. Boron toxicity was also induced by increasing the element 10x higher than the complete nutrient formula. Plants were monitored daily to document and photograph sequential series of symptoms as they developed. Typical symptomology of nutrient disorders and critical tissue concentrations are presented. Out of thirteen treatments, eleven exhibited symptomology. Symptoms of N, P, and S deficiencies and B toxicity manifested early; therefore, these disorders may be more likely problems encountered by growers. Based on this research, growers will be able to recognize and avoid nutritional disorders of globe amaranth plants grown in peat-based substrates.","[Barnes, J.; Whipker, B.; McCall, I.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Barnes, J (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Box 7609, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,,,,,,,5,3,3,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66052-57-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2013,982.0,,,,,,69,74,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture; Soil Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGP15,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323698200006,0

This study aims to investigate which type of consumer personality places greater value on the food traceability label. Design/methodology/approach According to the meta-theoretic model of motivation and personality (3M), this study develops a framework that links personality traits with food safety issues. Data are collected from a survey of consumers in shopping malls. The research hypotheses are tested using structural equation modeling. Findings Based on the 3M hierarchical model, consumers who have open, conscientious, and extroverted personalities, and material and body needs tend to have higher needs for learning and health consciousness. They care more for food value and have positive perception of food traceability labels. This results in intentions to purchase products with a food traceability label. Practical implications Using their conclusions on the relationship of personality traits with a food traceability system, the authors provide suggestions for businesses planning marketing strategies to gain competitive advantages. For consumers, a food traceability system creates value in food exchange. Regarding policy concerns, the government should regulate the implementation of a food traceability label to disclose comprehensive information regarding food safety. Originality/value Although various constructs are linked to food traceability, few studies have focused on the value of food exchange. Consumers with specific personality characteristics have different perceptions and reactions to a food traceability system. This study can fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between the value of food exchange and consumer personality traits.","[Chang, Aihwa] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Tseng, Chung-Hui] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City 251, Taiwan; [Chu, Min-yeh] Corp Synergy Dev Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; Tamkang University,"Tseng, CH (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City 251, Taiwan.",136466@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Tseng, Chung-Hui/IAP-4588-2023","Tseng, Chung-Hui/0000-0002-5356-7225",,,,,51,27,27,1,43,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted interviews with three food retail managers in South Korea to gather practical information about the management of perishable foods, which informed the design of a survey in which consumers in South Korea were questioned about their perceptions of the two strategies, with respect to nine perishable food products in three categories. The data collected were analysed by one-way ANOVA and the t-test. Findings - The findings of this research present an improved understanding of the impact of a multi-period pricing strategy on consumer satisfaction and customer behaviour for perishable foods. The conclusions have the potential to significantly assist food retailers to understand the consumers' perspective on the benefits of a more dynamic pricing strategy. Practical implications - The findings suggest that food retailers can enhance customer satisfaction by offering an earlier but lower discount, and increasing it as perishable food items approach their expiry date, rather than a higher discount when the expiry date is imminent. Originality/value - The findings in this study are significant since they serve as the first step in measuring the value of dynamic pricing approaches that provide better trade-off options between price and remaining shelf-life from consumers' perspectives.","[Chung, Jaekwon; Li, Dong] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Chung, J (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",jchung@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Li, Dong/0000-0002-5884-2943",,,,,47,24,30,0,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It is consumed with nono (local fermented milk) or mashed in water before consumption in the form of porridge. The purpose of this paper is to study the optimization of feed composition, feed moisture and screw speed on acceptability and hydration properties of fura extrudates from pearl millet and soybean flour mixtures. Design/methodology/approach - The effects of extrusion conditions feed composition (ratio of soybean to millet), percentage moisture wet basis and screw speed (rpm) on the hydration properties and the acceptability of fura from millet-soybean flour mixtures were studied using a single screw extruder. Response surface methodology (RSM) was adopted to evaluate the hydration properties responses of fura extrudates. Findings - The models showed R-2 = 0.863, 0.825, 0.898 and 0.741 for hydration power (HP), effect of quantity of water on swell volume (EQWSV), wettability (WTBLTY) and viscosity respectively indicating that the model was a good fit and could be used to navigate the design space. The result indicates that increasing the level of soybean flour resulted in decreased HP of fura extrudates. The overall acceptability sensory scores show that the fura extrudate design point 11 representing 20 percent soybean, 16.6 percent feed moisture and 200rpm recorded the highest acceptability (7.25) with significant differences from the other extrudates in terms of colour, flavor, texture and overall acceptability. Originality/value - The extrusion cooking data from this study could help predict the expected performance in investigations of potential use of millet and soybean to explore the possibility of industrial projection.","[Filli, K.

Our study incorporates short-run changes in prices and demands for palm oil and wood products, as well as the exchange rate, the real interest rate, land-use zoning, forest protection, the estimated opportunity cost of forested land, the quality of local governance, the poverty rate, population density, the availability of communications infrastructure, transport cost, local rainfall and terrain slope. The econometric results highlight the role of dynamic economic factors in forest clearing: significant roles for lagged changes in all the short-run economic variables product prices, demands, the exchange rate and the real interest rate as well as communications infrastructure, some types of commercial zoning, rainfall and terrain slope. We find no significance for the other variables, although our measure of protected-area status is too general for strong conclusions to be drawn about the empirical relationship between forest clearing and protection. It is also possible that the insignificance of transport cost in our results is due to collinearity with our proxy for communications cost, and/or the offsetting effects of transport cost on the direct profitability of forest clearing (negative) and the effectiveness of local forest regulation (positive). Our results strongly support a model of forest clearing as an investment that is highly sensitive to expectations about future forest product prices and demands, as well as changes in the cost of capital (indexed by the real interest rate), the relative cost of local inputs (indexed by the exchange rate), and the cost of land clearing (indexed by local precipitation). By implication, the opportunity cost of forested land fluctuates widely with changes in international markets and decisions by Indonesia's financial authorities about the exchange and interest rates. Our results suggest that forest conservation programs are unlikely to succeed if they ignore such powerful forces. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We test the theoretical hypothesis, which says that changes in fuel prices cause changes in land use both directly and indirectly and that, because of price inter-dependencies, biofuels reinforce the land use change impacts. We apply time-series analytical mechanisms to five major traded agricultural commodities, the cultivated area of agricultural land and crude oil price. Our data consists of yearly observations extending from 1950 to 2007 for the US. The empirical findings confirm that markets for crude oil and cultivated agricultural land are interdependent: an increase in oil price by 1 dollar/barrel increases land use between 54,000 and 68,000 ha. We also find that the increase of bioenergy sector accelerates land use change in the US, i.e. food commodities are being substituted for bioenergy crops. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our objectives were to analyze land use changes and calculate the value of these changes in terms of lost ecosystem services. We selected three study sites with contrasting infrastructure for tourism: Boca del Rio, Chachalacas and Costa Esmeralda. From 1995-2006, we found that urban sprawl was predominant, and occurred over mangroves, grasslands, croplands and the beach. Using the benefit transfer method, we calculated a net loss (SUS 2006/ha/year) of $1.4 x 10(3) in Boca del Rio. $7 x 10(5) in Chachalacas and $1 x 10(5) in Costa Esmeralda. Because the value of urban land is higher (from 45,000 USD/ha (2006) in Costa Esmeralda to 6 million in Boca del Rio) than the total estimated Ecosystem Services Value (106,000 USD/ha, including all ecosystems and ecosystem services), land use change may seem economically profitable. However, after losing ecosystem services such as coastal protection or scenic value and recreation, the apparent gains from urban development are lost. Land use and policy making should consider ecosystem service losses so that ecosystems are preserved and society benefited. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The sites were chosen to reflect substantial heterogeneity in extent, ecological composition and condition. Values were assessed both for local populations and for a distant population; residents of the state capital city of Brisbane. The results are encouraging for the use of benefit transfer, as values were robust to various site and population differences. No significant difference in protection values between the three local case studies could be identified. There was also no significant difference in values between the local population and the Brisbane population. However, some evidence for distance effects was identified for the Brisbane population, with closer sites valued more highly. There was some limited evidence that respondents have higher values to avoid potential losses compared to potential gains for REEF and SEAGRASS attributes, although this did not hold for the FISH attribute. One implication is that protection values are likely to be higher for closer reef areas at risk of loss than those with opportunity for improvement. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The study applied the direct expenditure approach to tourists who went on dolphin tours in Lovina in 2008 and 2009. This industry depends on predictable access to coastal dolphins, attracts at least 37,000 overnight visitors per annum (similar to 60% of the region's overnight tourists) and contributes at least 46% of the total direct expenditures (USD 4.1 million p.a.) for accommodation, meals, transportation, communication and souvenirs. The 179 boatmen enjoy an above average income and thus have little financial incentive to leave the industry. Nonetheless, trip fees constitute only 3% of the total expenditures generated by dolphin watching tourism. The remainder e.g., for accommodation, restaurants and transport is spent with local businesses which become the substantial beneficiaries and hence these stakeholders should also be consulted prior to any management intervention. This profitable industry supports 35-100 tour boats operating daily. The number of boats should be regulated to address concerns over their impacts on the dolphins and visitor satisfaction.

For coastal systems, a simple model is developed incorporating a spatial production function that declines across an ecological landscape. The basic model demonstrates how spatial production of ecosystem services affects the location and extent of landscape conversion. An extension allows for the risk of ecological collapse, when the critical size of the remaining landscape that precipitates the collapse is not known. Both models are simulated using the example of spatial variation in ecosystem services across a mangrove habitat that might be converted to shrimp aquaculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The implications of our generalization are quite relevant. In particular, we obtain the following novel results: (1) two additional nonsymmetric interior steady states emerge for some intermediate values of trade costs. These steady-states are stable if the industrial and the traditional goods are either good or very poor substitutes, while they are unstable for intermediate (yet lower than one) values of the intersectoral elasticity of substitution. In the latter case, the model displays three interior steady statesthe symmetric and the core-periphery allocationswhich are stable at the same time; (2) agglomeration processes may always take place, whatever the degree of market integration, provided that the traditional and the industrial goods are sufficiently good substitutes; (3) the regional rate of growth is affected by the interregional allocation of economic activities even in the absence of localized spillovers, so that geography always matters for growth and (4) the regional rate of growth is affected by the degree of market openness: in particular, depending on whether the traditional and the industrial goods are good or poor substitutes, economic integration may be, respectively, growth-enhancing or growth-detrimental.","[Cerina, Fabio; Mureddu, Francesco] CRENoS, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Cerina, Fabio; Mureddu, Francesco] Univ Cagliari, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Cerina, F (通讯作者)，CRENoS, Viale St Ignazio 78, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",fcerina@unica.it; francesco.mureddu@crenos.unica.it,,"Cerina, Fabio/0000-0003-4671-3404",,,,,28,5,5,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Despite its importance, it is not usually the main focus of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century European economic history. Looking at a vital manorial economy, this article deals with land transmissions, a crucial factor in the socioeconomic reproduction of pre-industrial societies, and demonstrates both similarities and important differences between the tenants on manorial land and freeholders. Although their strategies were often similar, we show that the manorial system consisted of a two-party government-the landlord and the tenant-whose interests did not always coincide. In the nineteenth century, market expansion and commercialization promoted more active landlord strategies in terms of demesne expansions and by means of implementing short-term leases. This made intergenerational transfers within the family increasingly difficult for tenants.","[Dribe, Martin; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Dribe, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,,"Svensson, Patrick/0000-0002-7143-416X",,,,,58,7,7,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We use a unique and expansive dataset of salaries and performance variables of Major League Baseball pitchers that spans over 400 players and 60 years during the reserve clause era to identify factors that determine salaries and examine how the importance of various factors have changed over time. We employ a Markov regime-switching regression model borrowed from the macroeconomics literature, which allows regression coefficients to switch exogenously between two or more values as time progresses. This method lets us identify changes in wage determination that may have occurred because of a change in the league's competitiveness, a change in the relative bargaining power between players and teams, or other factors that may be unknown or unobservable. We find that even though Major League Baseball was a tightly controlled monopsony with the reserve clause, there was a significant shift in salary determination that lasted from the Great Depression until after World War II where players' salaries were more highly linked to their recent performance.","[Haupert, Michael; Murray, James] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Murray, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1725 State St, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",haupert.mich@uwlax.edu; murray.jame@uwlax.edu,,,,,,,21,6,6,3,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2012,6.0,2,,,,,143,162,,10.1007/s11698-011-0067-2,0.0,,,20,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,933GT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303349300002,0

Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this work come from a survey of 361 Spanish consumers. The paper analyzes the levels of consumption and the knowledge of organic foods, proposing a contingent valuation exercise for organic tomatoes. The Hanemann model is used to estimate the average and maximum willingness to pay for this product. A multivariate logit model was calculated, with different starting prices and variables derived from a cluster analysis of consumers. Findings - Three distinct groups of consumers were identified, and their willingness to pay for organic tomatoes was modeled using contingent valuation. The results clearly show a generalized lack of knowledge of organic products and the confusion caused by the proliferation of labels. A clear relationship was also observed between consumers' levels of knowledge and consumption of organic foods and their willingness to pay a premium for these products. This confirms the interest shown by policy makers in promoting education and information aimed at developing the domestic market. Originality/value - This paper shows an interesting approach, as research on the influence of knowledge and consumption of organic food on consumers' willingness to pay for this product is scarce, and even more if one considers the local character of many of these studies. As the premium of organic food is one of the main constraints to the growth of this sector, results may be relevant both for producers and planners.","[Mesias Diaz, Francisco J.] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain; [Martinez-Carrasco Pleite, Federico; Martinez Paz, Jose Miguel] Univ Murcia, Dept Appl Econ, Murcia, Spain; [Gaspar Garcia, Paula] Univ Extremadura, Dept Anim Prod, Badajoz, Spain; [Martinez Paz, Jose Miguel] Univ Murcia, Inst Water & Environm, Murcia, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; University of Murcia; Universidad de Extremadura; University of Murcia,"Díaz, FJM (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain.",fjmesias@unex.es,"MARTÍNEZ-CARRASCO PLEITE, FEDERICO/H-5601-2015; MARTINEZ-PAZ, JOSE M./G-2508-2010; Mesias, Francisco J./L-6307-2017; Gaspar, Paula/F-6447-2014","MARTÍNEZ-CARRASCO PLEITE, FEDERICO/0000-0002-6208-6028; MARTINEZ-PAZ, JOSE M./0000-0001-8412-7647; Mesias, Francisco J./0000-0001-5334-9554; Gaspar, Paula/0000-0002-4832-8537",,,,,43,70,78,6,80,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper aims to present some ways that food companies can review policy and practice to meet this responsibility in the 21st century. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a review of relevant literature published between the 1980s through to 2010, changing attitudes and practices in the food manufacturing sector are outlined. These are analysed in the light of coinciding trends in consumer expectations and behaviour, and the development of new technologies for food production and information transfer. Findings - Widespread concern about the environment, increasing technological innovation, growing knowledge of diet-health relationships and changing patterns of diet-related disease risks are redefining responsibilities across the food industry. Food companies have been criticised for some negative effects on health, in particular, for contributing to obesogenic environments in many countries. Collaborating with all stakeholders will determine the way for the manufacturing sector to make positive contributions to public nutrition in the future.

Coffee shops provide a convenient microcosm for assessing the impact of hypocritical behavior because of (I) readily available, cheap substitutes (i.e., reusable coffee cups), (2) a relatively accurate estimate of the environmental (in particular, carbon) cost associated with using non-reusable cups, and (3) the ability to delineate hypocritical behavior by observing a choice with relatively few potential confounding factors. Hypocritical behavior is measured as a geometric mean of how often an individual takes coffee in a non-reusable cup and the degree to which the individual self-identifies as being concerned about his environmental footprint. All else equal, the more often a person takes his coffee in a non-reusable cup and the greater the degree to which he self-identifies as being concerned about his footprint, the greater the individual's hypocrisy score. Controlling for other attitudinal and demographic characteristics (including self-identified awareness of environmental issues and willingness to pay for the convenience of using a non-reusable cup), we are able to determine the marginal effect of an individual's hypocrisy score on the environmental cost associated with the use of non-reusable coffee cups.

This paper considers some limitations of the ES paradigm by examining one category of ES: cultural services, including the environmental basis for esthetic, spiritual, and recreational experiences, cultural heritage, sense of place, and ways of life. It examines whether cultural ES can be assessed in terms of purely individual benefits or if social/collective considerations must be included; and whether the concept of 'services' even provides an appropriate framework for understanding such values. To pursue these questions I consider the recent literature on the assessment and valuation of 'cultural services' and assess the adequacy of this perspective against several examples from American Indian communities of the Pacific Northwest. Three characteristics of these situations from Indian Country are problematic for an ES framework: the social construction of environmental experience, the symbolic character of environmental knowledge, and the multidimensionality of environmental value. On the basis of this analysis, I propose a model of culturally reflexive stewardship as potentially a more productive and theoretically consistent framework for characterizing such socially constructed environmental values and practices.

Some pesticides are toxic both to the targeted pest and the predaceous or parasitic insect that could provide pest control. Alternative pesticides with fewer or no negative effects on the beneficial insect often exist but can be more expensive, Additionally, some beneficial insects are commercially available and can be purchased and released in the field. This paper models the pest control decisions of a grower who utilizes a pesticide and a predaceous insect to control the crop pest and compares these decisions to that of a grower who does not know that the predaceous insect exists. The results show that the latter grower will drive the predator population to zero and will overutilize chemical control. When the predator is known and utilized, the optimal decisions involve entirely mitigating the negative effects of the pesticide as well as releasing additional predators. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Sustainable tourism development implies a combination of ecological protection, economic prosperity and social benefits for local communities. This requires an effective marketing policy to identify and attract visitors interested in - and motivated by - the particular local attractions of the place. This study addresses the development of tourism services on the Shiretoko Peninsula, a World Heritage Site since 2005, located in the northeast part of the Japanese island of Hokkaido. The novelty of our study is found in a systemic approach, combining tourists' characteristics and expectations/motivations regarding a certain destination with the resulting dissatisfaction and loyalty behaviour regarding the tourist site concerned. A multinomial logistic regression is applied to the tourists' characteristics and motivations, while next a structural path analysis is applied to the elements determining their satisfaction with the visit concerned.

A systematic approach can aid in examining the social, economic and environmental impacts that extend beyond political motivations to divest from fossil fuel companies. We have adapted publicly available economic input-output life cycle assessment models (EIO-LCA) to develop a Shadow Impact Calculator (SIC) for examining the potential environmental impacts of investment decisions. An investment portfolio's shadow impacts represent the economic, social and environmental effects underlying an investor's decision to place their funds in particular financial instruments. In this study, we focus on greenhouse gas emissions to show which sectors of the United States economy have particularly large or small carbon shadows and place those results in the context of volatility and earnings. To demonstrate how SIC may be used, we examine the endowment investments of a Canadian university in the context of divesting from fossil fuel companies. Our analysis suggests that large pooled funds choosing to direct their investments away from heavy carbon emitters may have less of an impact than would otherwise be expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The opening of a new facility is associated with an increase in residential mortgage applications in nearby areas of about 20 percent. However, much of the differential is due to facility location. The new facilities locate in areas which grew faster even if they were not near a new facility. Based on regressions using census-tract level data, we find that conditioning on local income and poverty rates reduces the effect by more than a half, suggesting that characteristics of locations drive much the increase on mortgage applications associated with new sports facilities.","[Huang, Haifang] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada; [Humphreys, Brad R.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",University of Alberta; West Virginia University,"Huang, HF (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, 8-14 Tory, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",haifang.huang@ualberta.ca; brhumphreys@mail.wvu.edu,"Humphreys, Brad R/P-3340-2019","Humphreys, Brad R/0000-0003-0099-7237",,,,,42,19,21,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

We know a great deal about the elite policy debates on the significance of this inflation, and the arguments about how to reduce it, but we know far less about how inflation was understood by the population at large, and how those understandings were shaped. This article explores the evidence on popular understanding, especially analysing the material gathered by the Counter-Inflation Publicity Unit, created in the summer of 1975. Along with other evidence, this material is used to explore how far the Labour government's economic propaganda can be said to have influenced popular opinion on both the significance and causes of inflation. The evidence supports the argument that the belief that trade unions were the main culprit for inflation was reinforced and entrenched by this propaganda, with important unintended consequences for the arguments about policy that followed the 'Winter of Discontent' of 1978/9.","Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Tomlinson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,66,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

These events are also generally considered to be crucial by historians-for example, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. However, some events to which historians attach great importance, such as the conflicts between Nationalists and Communists in the 1930s, were not reflected in the bond market and did not attract much media attention. Some events, such as the Sino-Japanese ceasefire in Tanggu in 1933, were thought to be crucial by contemporaries, but have been downplayed by later observers.","[Ho, Chun-Yu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Li, Dan] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Fudan University,"Li, D (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",danli1981@fudan.edu.cn,,"Ho, Chun-Yu/0000-0002-4498-9610",,,,,39,14,17,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The series are analyzed and compared to similar series from Sweden and USA. Continuously compounded nominal returns in Finland have been high, 12.91 and 6.44 % per annum for the stock and money markets, respectively. However, taking into account the high annual average inflation rate of 7.77, the Finnish market has provided clearly lower real returns than the US market. On the other hand, the equity premium, 10.14 % per annum, is found to be comparable to that of the United States (9.35 %) and higher than that in Sweden (6.01 %) using an approach similar to Mehra and Prescott (Handbook of the economics of finance, vol 1B.

The experiment was part of a socioeconomic survey wherein interviewees were asked about their fishing and diving practices, views on fish population and coral reef health, and preferred marine resource management approaches. We use a ss delta-model to identify discounting and present bias. Divers had a mean individual discount factor (IDF) of 0.91, significantly higher than fishers' mean of 0.82. Fishers and divers had similar distributions of IDFs and present bias; overall 66% of interviewees were non-biased, 22% future-biased, and 12% present-biased. IDFs and present bias were able to predict management preferences after controlling for demographic factors. However, the effect of discount factors is unique to divers, and the effect of present bias is concentrated among fishers on Curacao. Differences in time preferences between fishers and divers should be considered when developing management strategies. Transfer payments from the dive industry could facilitate a transition to sustainable fishing practices. Establishing property rights alone may not be sufficient for ensuring sustainability if fishers are present-biased and greatly discount the future. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To this end, we examine the location decisions of new manufacturing firms in Spain at the city level and for narrowly defined industries. First, we estimate firm location models to obtain estimates that reflect the importance of localization and urbanization economies in each industry. Then, we regress these estimates on industry characteristics related to the potential importance of labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Urbanization effects are high in knowledge-intensive industries, suggesting that firms locate in large cities to benefit from knowledge spillovers.

In addition, objective risk measured as proximity to the pollution source, is considered. The main finding is that both types of perceived risk negatively and significantly influence people's happiness, although in absolute terms, the total perceived risk effect is less than the (positive) effect of ability, measured by income and education. Other important determinants of happiness are family size, age, proximity to the pollution source, work environment and current health condition. Perceived risk due to intensity of exposure is influenced by environmental knowledge and proximity to the pollution source; perceived risk of hazard by ability, environmental knowledge, family size, family health experience and proximity to the pollution source. Environmental knowledge is found to be a function of age, ability and work environment. On the basis of the findings, we conclude that reducing air pollution is an important policy measure to ameliorate happiness.

In this paper, the images acquired with selected devices and different lighting (Front lighting, Backlight, and Front lighting & Backlight) were processed based on the theory of machine vision. The experimental result shows that a blue backlight without a filter device is the best to inspect the seedlings. The images of inspecting seedlings were captured using the selected machine vision system. The algorithm developed using the machine vision system was found functional in inspecting the grafted seedlings; it can even detect a very small gap (<= 0.2 mm) between the scion and rootstock after they have been grafted.","[Ashraf, M.

The gravity models are based on nonlinear (power function) regression made in Statistica 9.0 software. Using the mentioned model the author explains the influence of GDP of considered countries and distances between them on total export and import of art in the period 2003-2012. It has been proven in the paper that gravity models of international trade, which have been successfully applied to description of international trade with different types of goods and services, may also be used with respect to such specific commodities as works of art.

Using data on manufacturing enterprises operating in China during 1998-2006, this paper provides evidence on the net effect of opposing spillovers from nearby economic activity. Central to the analysis is the opportunity to distinguish local manufacturing enterprises by state, private, or foreign ownership. Systematic differences in average productivity of these firms enable inferences about differences in the strength of spillovers from one type of firm to another type. Results indicate that spillovers are larger within the same ownership type than they are across them, consistent with localization economies that operate within segmented channels of influence.","US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Kamal, F (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",fariha.kamal@census.gov,,,,,,,33,6,6,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

According to hyperbolic model, people tend to discount distant-future (near-future) events at lower (higher) rates. As a result of conflict between patient future self and impulsive present self, individuals reverse their preferences. Although practical implications of hyperbolic discounting model for saving behavior can be found in numerous research papers (e.g. Laibson, 1997; Angeletos et al., 2001), the majority of them draw conclusions from empirical analysis of U.S. household behavior. Therefore, it is not clear if their results are not culture-specific. In this paper we seek an answer to the following question: will findings from the aforementioned research hold true if we examine the essence of hyperbolic discounting within a very different cultural context? As a result of analyzing various statistical data (saving rates, asset composition, consumption structure, and household indebtedness) over time, we show that in many cases Czech households do not behave in accordance with hyperbolic discounting model.","[Korlyakova, Darya; Horejsi, Bronislava] Univ Econ Prague VSE, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",,"Korlyakova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague VSE, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",korlyakova.d@gmail.com; bronislava.horejsi@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,732,742,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700072,0

The school headed by Master Albin Braf and his pupils J. Gruber, C. Horacek, K. Englis and a range of others fulfilled educative and scientific tasks. Splitting of Czech countries economy to Czech and German national economies and a feeling of threat of German dominance were factors which lead to the national economy revival. The revival required economic emancipation and economic self-sufficiency of the Czech society. It manifested itself in economic nationalism. Albin Braf connected the effort of economic emancipation of Czech society with the national revival so that the emancipation gained additional motivation and deeper ideological sense. Albin Braf distinguished three developmental periods of the national revival. The first was the linguistic and literary revival, the second a kind of political one and only the third period was filled with the national economy revival.","Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Fak Business Adm, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Krames, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Fak Business Adm, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",krames@vse.cz,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,776,784,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700076,0

Both theoretically and empirically, the consequences of strengthening IPRs in lagging economies for technology transfer and innovation remain unclear. Although the mainstream literature tends to link stronger patent enforcement with better invention and innovation markets now and in the past, new theoretical and historical evidence supports extreme complexity in the relationship between IPR extension and scope and technological diffusion. For the first time, in this study, we analyze a large series of patents of introduction, which were a common feature of the early stages of almost all patent systems designed to favor technology transfer and innovation above original inventor property rights. Though typically used by pioneers, followers, and latecomers, we know little of how they functioned and their consequences. In this study, we analyze the use of patents of introduction throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Spain, which was a lagging country on the European periphery. The results demonstrate that this institutional policy could facilitate technology transfer, innovation, and advancement at earlier stages of industrialization. As additional research has demonstrated, such evidence may have serious implications for IPR treatment in both developing and underdeveloped economies.","Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Sáiz, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, Ctra Colmenar,Km 15, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",patricio.saiz@uam.es,"Sáiz, Patricio/L-2384-2013","Sáiz, Patricio/0000-0003-2714-7443",,,,,47,16,18,1,39,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2014,8.0,1,,,,,49,78,,10.1007/s11698-013-0094-2,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,293RG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329990800004,0

The results showed that there were no substantial differences between Czech and Slovak building companies both in the concept and human resource management practices. The concept of human resource management in big building companies is more strategic and systematic which fact is natural given the high number of employees in various professions who perform various construction works. Applied human resource management practices show both significant merits and certain deficiencies although it is difficult to prove the existence of an unambiguous relation between efficiency of human resource management and success of building companies.

Exploring emotional responses of food bank receivers in the Netherlands,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,The Netherlands; Food waste; Food banks; Emotional responses; Poverty allevation,SHAME; GUILT; INSECURITY; ASSISTANCE; POVERTY; WASTE; WORK,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address how food, social status as well as the interactions at the food bank induce emotions in receivers, such as shame, gratitude and anger. Since early 2000s a steadily growing number of low-income and/or over-indebted households in the Netherlands alleviate their situation with food donations from local food banks. Such food banks collect from companies edible food that would otherwise have gone to waste. The growing demand for food assistance indicates it is a welcome contribution to the groceries in many households. However, receiving food assistance as well as eating the products forces the receivers to set aside embodied dispositions towards food and norms about how to obtain food. Furthermore, it places them in interactions of charitable giving that may be harmful to the self-esteem of receivers. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a qualitative study at a food bank in the Netherlands, consisting among others of in-depth interviews with 17 receivers of food assistance, observations and several interviews with volunteers. Findings - Of all emotions that were expressed during the interviews, shame appeared as the most prominent. Particularly issues of shame emerged in relation to all three food-bank-related experiences: the content of the crate, the interaction with volunteers and lastly the understanding of one's positioning in a social hierarchy. While shame can be a very private emotion - even talking about being ashamed can be shameful - it is also an utterly social emotion. Originality/value - This research is among the few ones explicitly addressing emotional emotions related to receivers in food bank.","[van der Horst, Hilje] Wageningen Univ, Sociol Consumpt & Households Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pascucci, Stefano] Wageningen Univ, Management Studies Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bol, Wilma] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Pascucci, S (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Management Studies Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",stefano.pascucci@wur.nl,"Cavicchi, Alessio/A-4477-2016","Cavicchi, Alessio/0000-0002-7793-865X",,,,,40,144,154,9,63,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Even more importantly, it is an issue, which likely promotes inequitable conditions and the social conflict of different (basic) needs. Within this context, the dominant argument criticizes the growing demand for biofuels in the north to compromise food security and sovereignty in the south. In order to address these trade-offs and conflicts, the objective of this paper is the introduction of a conceptual framework of socio-environmental services. By expanding the construct of environmental services to explicitly include the social dimension, it shall accommodate for the fact that the provision of environmental services is often embedded in a complex system of global (economic, ecological as well as social) interdependencies. Recently, the concept of payments for environmental services (PES) has received much attention with respect to its potential contribution to both environmental sustainability and the economic alleviation of poverty. By linking the idea of payments for socio-environmental services (PSES) to the three functions of justice, its beneficial impact may be more fully tapped. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It indicates that open space externalities warrant rather mild restrictions on urban expansion.,"[Vermeulen, Wouter] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Wouter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rouwendal, Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rouwendal, Jan] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Vermeulen, W (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",w.vermeulen@cpb.nl; j.rouwendal@vu.nl,"Rouwendal, Jan/G-2478-2011","Rouwendal, Jan/0000-0003-0070-086X",,,,,24,5,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Using a case study approach and assuming limited conservation resources, this approach is applied to calculate the maximum diversity which can be conserved based on a clustering of cacao species (Theobroma cacao L). A conservation budget allocation model applied across a set of ten clusters and nine subclusters of cacao, together with the use of alternative diversity and risk measures, allowed for an evaluation of a range of potential conservation outcomes. Alternative risk measures generally resulted in the allocation of conservation funds to the same priority clusters of cacao (Criollo and Curaray). However, the use of the number of locally common alleles as an alternative to the original Weitzman diversity measure produced a markedly different result, prioritising the Puri's cluster in Western Amazonia. The Curaray cluster was highly prioritised under both diversity measures, indicating its distinctiveness relative to both the Criollo and Puri's clusters. We conclude that the Weitzman approach can indeed allow diversity comparisons to be made between the outcomes of different PGR conservation strategies, although subjective decisions regarding the choice of diversity and risk measures remain.

These tests check the validity of the theory of comprehensive national accounting, and more broadly of the theory of economic growth. The value of technological progress is included, as well as the effects of business cycles. We use estimates for Portugal as inputs. Overall, our results indicate that both genuine savings and changes in green net national income have the same sign as changes in welfare, but reject the hypothesis that the estimated comprehensive national accounting measures coincide with the theoretical expressions. The results also suggest that comprehensive accounting indicators perform better than conventional national accounting indicators, implying that, in general, the corrections proposed by the comprehensive accounting theory add explanatory power to conventional measures. The exception is the inclusion of education expenditures and technological progress, which decrease explanatory power. Excluding business cycles from green net national income increases the agreement with the theory. Comparing both indicators, in general, genuine savings presents better results.

There is considerable debate about the appropriateness of this practice, in part because the effect of cause of death may be partly confounded with latency, initial risks, and competing risks. Preference for reducing risks can be also affected by individual-assessed risk attributes that are rarely controlled in valuation studies. This paper explores reasons for differences in preferences for mortality risk reductions (if any), and establishes the magnitude of the effects of such risk attributes as compared to other sources of VSL heterogeneity. In our conjoint choice experiments, cause of death, the size of the risk reduction, and latency, the price of the risk reduction and the mode of delivery of the risk reduction are explicit attributes of the alternatives to be examined by the respondent. Our statistical models also control for actual and perceived exposure to risks, initial risks, risk attributes such as dread, and sensitivity to and controllability of specific risks. We find that there is significant heterogeneity in the valuation of mortality risks and thus in the VSL The VSL increases with dread, exposure to risk, and the respondents' assessments of the baseline risks. It is higher when the risk reduction is delivered by a public program, and increases with the effectiveness rating assigned by the respondent to the mode of the risk reduction. Even when we control explicitly for all of these factors, the cause of death per se accounts for a large portion of the VSL All else the same, the fact that the cause of the death is cancer results in a VSL that is about one million euro above the amount predicted by dread, exposure and other risk perception variables. The VSL in the road safety context is about one million euro less than what is predicted by dread, exposure, or beliefs compared to VSL for the respiratory risk context. The effect of cause of death is thus as large as the effect of other sources of VSL heterogeneity. Our respondents do not seem to discount future risks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

When the variables are categorical, the challenges are even more severe. Applications of categorical data fusion are of top importance in marketing, especially in advertising. A great deal of categorical data fusion methods are confined to binary variables. In this paper we develop an innovative approach to categorical data fusion that extends previous methodologies and applies to categorical variables with any number of levels. We introduce a new concept of evident dependence that describes a variety of patterns of joint distributions given the marginals. Using information from partially fused data, our method smoothly accommodates a Bayesian approach based on mixtures of joint distributions constructed using evident dependence.

As suggested by NEG literature, our results support the hypothesis of a relationship between wages and regional market access and show the change in the regional wage structure following the gradual closing of the Spanish economy and of Spain's trade partners, as a result of the increasing importance of the domestic market. We find evidence of the existence of a regional wage gradient centred on Barcelona which weakened during these years.

By combining information on these different kinds of property, it is possible to explore how different strata of wealth holders accumulated specific forms of wealth at the time of their death. The article then examines how the composition of that wealth varied according to the wealth holder's location in the urban hierarchy and distance from London. It points out important geographical differences in both the scale and nature of wealth holding and raises questions about the implications of these findings.","[Green, David R.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Owens, Alastair] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Green, DR (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-1435] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,98,7,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This implies examining the economic, decision making and technological context of the end-user before trying to attribute economic values to well known biological processes. This paper provides an example of how this research approach for ecosystems services could unfold. In the Llobregat River in northeastern Spain, higher stream temperatures require water treatment managers to switch on costly water treatment equipment especially during warm months. This creates an opportunity to align the economic interests of downstream water users with the environmental goals of river managers. A restored riparian forest or an increase in stream flow could reduce the need for this expensive equipment by reducing stream temperatures below critical thresholds. We used the Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTEMP) to test the impact of increasing shading and discharge on stream temperature at the intake of the drinking water treatment plant. The value of the stream temperature ecosystem services provided by existing forests is 79,000 per year for the water treatment facility, while additional riparian forest restoration along the Llobregat River could generate economic savings for water treatment managers in the range of 57,000- 156,000 per year. Stream restoration at higher elevations would yield greater benefits than restoration in the lower reaches. Moderate increases in stream discharge (25%) could generate savings of 40,000 per year.

This paper develops a game theoretical model to investigate whether these two types of switching costs complement or substitute each other in a firm's strategy. Our analysis uncovers a substituting relationship, i.e., the equilibrium size of endogenous switching costs should be higher in markets with lower exogenous switching costs. In the equilibrium, the endogenous switching costs cause profit losses to competing firms; the amount of profit loss decreases with the size of exogenous switching costs.","Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",University of Toronto,"Shi, MZ (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",mshi@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,25,5,13,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Pro-environmental attitudes are measured using the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale. Although the empirical evidence of this paper supports a significant attitude-WTP association, the causal mechanism is different from previous theorizing. When observed at the parameter level using random parameter logit models, the significant causal linkages are evident with both the target good and the payment variable. The findings of this paper not only support direct and indirect impacts of general attitudes on WTP, but also provide novel findings about the causal mechanism for a significant attitude-WTP relationship at the parameter level in a non-Western case study. The impact of past visiting experience was also significant on the relationship, undermining the impact of attitudes on WTP. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

(2012) make strong claims to have identified the most influential works, authors, journals and institutions in a hypothetical field they call environmental and ecological economics. This paper shows that their work is biased by its framing, far from the non-subjective approach they claim and highly sensitive to minor data errors. More than this the exercise can be seen as another example of how ecological economics is susceptible to suppression by a dominant mainstream economic perspective which attempts to override, belittle and dismiss a whole range of alternative thought, including that which is heterodox, interdisciplinary, from the natural sciences and based in the non-economic social sciences. Ecological economics is not the same as agricultural, resource or environmental economics, and if it were it would be pointless. Neither can it be understood or treated as a subfield of resource and environmental economics, as done by Hoepner et al. (2012). I argue that the study promotes a limited perspective on social, environmental and economic problems that includes an implicit political and ideological framing. What is most influential, important or high quality in ecological economics is certainly not defined by such work.

A cost effectiveness framework designed to provide a comprehensive and logical structure for economic evaluation of path dependent institutional choices in this context, and a procedure for boundedly rational empirical application of the framework, are proposed and illustrated in this article - including for the choice between water buy-back and infrastructure upgrade programmes for accumulating the 'environmental water' needed to sustain the ecosystems of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin.

This finding can be used to identify a threshold for the amount of sequestered carbon per hectare below which the costs of carbon sequestration are hardly influenced by climate change.

Its principal innovations are the treatment of global equity, calculation of the optimum interregional flows of resources, and use of McKinsey marginal abatement cost curves to project the cost of mitigation. The unconstrained, optimal climate policy in CRED involves very large capital flows from high-income to developing countries, to an extent that might be considered politically unrealistic. Under more realistic constraints, climate outcomes are generally worse; climate stabilization requires either moderate capital flows to developing countries, or a very low discount rate. In CRED, more equitable scenarios have better climate outcomes; the challenge of climate policy is to persuade high-income countries to accept the need for both international equity and climate protection. The paper ends with an agenda for further model development. A technical appendix describes the model relationships and parameters in greater detail. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We use a spatially explicit mathematical programming model which studies the farmers' behavior as profit maximizers under technical and administrative constraints. Facing different policy measures, each farmer chooses the land-use on each field, which determines the landscape at the regional level. A spatial pattern index (Ripley L function) is then associated to the obtained landscape, indicating on the degree of dispersion of the reserve. We compare a subsidy per hectare of reserve with an auction scheme and an agglomeration malus. We find that the auction is superior to the uniform subsidy for cost-efficiency. The agglomeration malus does better than the auction for the spatial pattern but is more costly. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Substrate manufacturers typically raise the weight-based water content of soilless root substrate to 50% to ensure adequate wettability during crop establishment. This study investigated the possibility of lowering the percentage of water in substrate containing DMC in order to reduce Db without adversely affecting wettability. DMC was incorporated into a 3 sphagnum peat moss : 1 perlite (v: v) formula as a partial substitution for peat moss at 0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30% by volume of the substrate. The water content of each of the five formulations was adjusted to approximately 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% by weight. Wettability curves were generated to assess the impact of DMC content and initial water content on substrate wettability. The wettability level in the 0% DMC substrate at the industry norm water content of 50% was achieved in 7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30% DMC substrates at water contents of 40, 30, 20, and 20%, respectively. Based on previous research, 15% DMC is a desirable level for plant growth. The Db of 0 and 15% DMC mixes at 50% water content are 130 and 232 g/L (a Db gain of 78%), respectively. However, our research indicated that only 30% water is required in the 15% DMC mix for it to equal the wettability in the 0% DMC-50% water mix. This reduction lowered the Db of the 15% DMC-30% H2O mix to 180 g/L (a 39% Db gain), which cuts the Db gain due to the DMC addition in half and lowers the handling and transportation costs of this mix; this scenario is best for the industry.","[Barnes, J.; Nelson, P.; Fonteno, W.

Design/methodology/approach Two 2 x 2 experiment designs were used to investigate the influences of nutrient ad disclosures, subjective nutrition knowledge, and BMI on consumers' evaluation behavior. Findings The findings indicate that: the evaluative disclosure led to significantly less favorable consumer evaluations of selected fast food menu items than did the absolute disclosure; consumers who had high subjective nutrition knowledge and who were low BMI (i.e. people who have normal BMI) conducted significantly more critical evaluations of focal fast food meals with nutrient ad disclosures than did their counterparts. Practical implications Those findings imply that policy makers should develop a new format of nutrition information on fast food meals based on the evaluative disclosure in order to help consumers choose healthful foods. Originality/value Even though the effectiveness of the new menu-labeling regulation of the fast food industry is still controversial, only a few studies have been conducted to find a more effective nutrition information format than the current format. Thus, this study provides valuable implications to policy makers in terms of developing a more effective nutrition information format.","Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Le Cordon Bleu Hospitality Management, Seoul, South Korea",Sookmyung Women's University,"Hwang, J (通讯作者)，Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Le Cordon Bleu Hospitality Management, Seoul, South Korea.",emptiness96@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,5,6,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Although there are many models of health and social behaviour, there is a paucity of research utilising these in breakfast consumption and very few studies that directly compare these models. This study aims to compare the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the health action process approach (HAPA) in predicting breakfast consumption. Design/methodology/approach - University students (N = 102; M = 19.5 years) completed a questionnaire measuring demographics, TPB and HAPA motivational variables, and intentions. Behaviour and HAPA volitional variables were measured four weeks later. Findings - Using structural equation modelling, it was found that the TPB model was a superior fit to the data across a range of model indices compared to the HAPA. Both models significantly predicted both intentions and behaviour at follow up; however, the TPB predicted a higher proportion of the variance in breakfast consumption (47.6 per cent) than the HAPA (44.8 per cent). Further, the volitional variables did not mediate the intention-behaviour gap, and the data were not an adequate statistical fit to the model compared to the TPB. Research limitations/implications - The results support the use of the TPB and show that some aspects of the HAPA are useful in predicting breakfast consumption, suggesting that risk perception and self-efficacy be targeted in interventions to increase behaviour. The volitional variables did not appear to mediate breakfast consumption indicating that intention is still the strongest predictor, at least in this behaviour. Originality/value - The current study is the first to compare the TPB and HAPA in predicting breakfast consumption.","[Mullan, Barbara; Wong, Cara; Kothe, Emily; Maccann, Carolyn] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Mullan, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",barbara@psych.usyd.edu.au,"Kothe, Emily/M-7888-2013; Mullan, Barbara/E-2474-2019; MacCann, Carolyn/H-7590-2013","Kothe, Emily/0000-0003-1210-0554; Mullan, Barbara/0000-0002-0177-8899; MacCann, Carolyn/0000-0001-7789-6368",,,,,58,11,11,1,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The authentic benefits of adding whey products are the enhanced worth resulting from flavor, texture and nutritional improvements as well as nutraceutical or health-enhancing payback. Therefore, the present study aims to isolate and characterize suitable starter cultures for the production of wheyghurt drink. Design/methodology/approach - Keeping in view all the benefits of yoghurt technology this study was planned to isolate the starter cultures and optimize the conditions for the production of wheyghurt drink. The starter cultures (Lactobacillus delbruceckii ssp. Bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) were isolated from the yoghurt and further characterized on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. The wheyghurt drink prepared from starter cultures with varying starter culture concentrations (1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 percent) was analyzed for the physicochemical and sensory characteristics to explore the potential of wheyghurt drink. Findings - During storage, color, flavor, taste and overall acceptability were affected significantly. But the interaction between treatments and storage was found non-significant to all the sensory parameters. At zero day maximum score (7.40) for overall acceptability was recorded for T-3 and minimum score (5.60) was awarded to T-4. After five, ten and 15 days of storage, judges observed a slight decline in overall acceptability in all wheyghurt drink samples. Hence it was concluded that wheyghurt drink sample T3 obtained maximum scores regarding the organoleptic evaluation and remained the best. Practical implications - The key to growth is a continuous evaluation and modification of the product to match consumer expectations. Currently there are many apparent benefits that result from incorporating selected whey products into yogurt formulas. The starter cultures for the production of fermented whey products are not presently produced in Pakistan and are imported for industrial use. The use of LAB as starter culture may help to improve the quality and shelf life of the whey products. Originality/value - The research is useful for food manufacturers in order to develop functional food products for consumers. Understanding consumer needs and preferences is critical to successful product development and enhancing marketing values of a product. Nutritionally improved foods, such as wheyghurt over the conventional counterpart, will be highly successful in the marketplace. Consumers will prefer such kinds of foods because they are more conscious about their health and such foods provide them with what they desire, i.e. health benefits with good nutrition.","[Saeed, Muhammad; Anjum, Faqir Muhammad; Khan, Moazzam Rafiq; Khan, Muhammad Issa; Nadeem, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Natl Inst Food Sci & Technol, Faisalabad, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Khan, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Natl Inst Food Sci & Technol, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",drkhan@uaf.edu.pk,"Nadeem, Muhammad/AAZ-2541-2021; ANJUM, FAQIR/AAW-9311-2020; anjum, Faqir/F-5883-2015; Saeed, Muhammad/ABI-2832-2020; Khan, Muhammad Issa/J-3747-2015","Khan, Muhammad Issa/0000-0002-3241-1248",,,,,48,5,5,2,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This research employed a sequential mixed research approach which integrated both qualitative and quantitative methods. A total of 12 in-depth interviews and three focus groups were carried out to identify product concepts for new FFCBs. A conjoint model (n = 299) was then developed to evaluate product-specific factors that influenced consumer acceptance of FFCBs. Findings - Potential target consumers of FFCBs were more likely to be young females who had relatively high educational and income levels. Flavour and health/nutritional claim were found to be the most important product attributes for consumers. The simulation analysis predicted two FFCB concepts for target consumers. Research limitations/implications - As there is a limited range of FFCBs on the market, the concept of FFCBs may be novel to consumers. Further research would be beneficial that closely integrates the strategic marketing of FFCBs with sensory analysis conducted on a range of these beverages. Practical implications - During the early stages of the new product development (NPD) process, a market-oriented research methodology can help optimise product concepts in terms of product attributes that drive consumer acceptance. Originality/value - This paper provides an important insight into the significance of market-oriented knowledge generation techniques for the development of new cereal-based functional foods. It provides market-oriented information on FFCBs which can be valuable for food manufacturers to maximise NPD performance and to gain competitive advantage in the functional beverages market.","[Yu, Huan; Bogue, Joe] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Bogue, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland.",j.bogue@ucc.ie,"Yu, Huan/AAZ-5078-2021","Bogue, Joe/0000-0002-2359-3377",,,,,50,21,21,0,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Traditionally this has been approached from the angle of shifting the goods people purchase towards lower impact options. But an equally valid angle is through changing the way people use their time. This study explores the GHG emissions per unit time for different types of activities. It focuses on 'non-work' time, and examines how different activities, such as household chores and leisure pursuits, give rise to varying amounts of household carbon emissions. We do this first for an average British adult, and then examine how time use varies within households, and how this impacts on resulting carbon emissions. We find, for example, that leisure activities are generally associated with lower carbon emissions than non-leisure activities, and that a higher proportion of an average man's carbon footprint is due to leisure than an average woman's. In the discussion we explore the implications of our findings for the varying roles carried out within different types of household, we investigate the concept of carbon as a potential marker for social justice, and discuss the implications for work-time reduction policies.

In this article, I develop a strategic theory of geoengineering. I emphasize two key features of geoengineering. First, whereas emissions reductions can be mandated now, geoengineering techniques are only available in the future. Second, major powers can unilaterally implement geoengineering projects that may hurt other countries. My game-theoretic analysis demonstrates that unilateral geoengineering presents a difficult governance problem if it produces negative externalities in foreign countries. Interestingly, countries may be tempted to reduce emissions now, so as to prevent a harmful geoengineering race in the future. The theoretical results can help scholars and policymakers understand the relationship between climate mitigation and geoengineering.","Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 420 W 118 St,712 IAB, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,22,38,39,6,100,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Also, it is shown that popular methods for aggregating firm/industry estimates of productivity growth have a serious problem in that productivity of all firms/industries can go up, but aggregate productivity can fall. This is not necessarily due to changes in the reallocation of resources across firms/industries. Hence, there are problems for the interpretation of previously published articles which use these methods. There can be inappropriate assessments of the cyclical properties of productivity, and the productivity impact of industry dynamics, micro-economic reforms and regulatory change.

These outcomes are often measured through the quality of their outputs (plans or strategies) as well as whether the objectives of the plans or strategies are achieved. This paper contributes to this debate by reporting on a longitudinal evaluation of stakeholder engagement in developing and implementing River Basin Management Planning (RBMP) in Scotland. We illustrate how many of the process and outcome criteria promoted in the literature (the external perspective) appear to be less important to stakeholders than would be expected (the internal perspective). The paper argues that a combination of internal and external criteria is best placed to understand how to judge a 'good' process. This paper draws on literature from water management, other natural resource management sectors, spatial planning and environmental management so the findings are of interest to scholars interested in evaluation, participation, environmental or natural resource management, as well as those specifically interested in RBMP under the Water Framework Directive (WFD).

The proposed strategy is unique because it may help fishermen recover fishery resources by closing for the first several months of the fishing season without decreasing their average annual landings. If demand is elastic, it is feasible that they could recover biomass without reducing average annual revenue. To demonstrate the validity of this strategy, this study empirically examines the ocellate puffer in the vicinity of Japan, as it has experienced a drastic depletion of biomass. The results indicate that if fishing were to be prohibited, for example, between October and February (current fishing season is between October and March), ocellate puffer recovery in the first year would be 30,453 kg, which would have the same effect as an 18.4% reduction in the current average landings. The price elasticity for ocellate puffer is elastic, which implies not only that fishery revenue would not decrease, but that the strategy could be a promising means of recovering ocellate puffer stocks.

This study uses a transaction cost framework, in conjunction with detailed case studies of two water quality payment schemes, to examine factors that increase and decrease transaction costs in order to improve policy choice as well as policy design and implementation. In both the Munich and New York City cases, agreements with farmers to change land management practices resolved the water quality problems. In Munich, factors including lack of rural/urban antipathy, homogeneous land use, utilization of well-developed organic standards, and strong demand for organic products decreased transaction costs. Using existing organic institutions addressed a range of environmental issues simultaneously. Factors that decreased transaction costs in both cases included: highly sensitive land was purchased outright and the existence of one large buyer. Adequate lead time and flexibility of water quality regulations allowed negotiation and development of the watershed programs. Tourism and eco-labels allow urban residents to become aware of the agricultural production practices that affect their water supply. We conclude with recommendations based on the experiences of these cities, both of which have been proposed as models for other schemes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Heavily protected Latin America also boasted some of the most explosive belle epoque growth, while open Asia registered some of the least. What brought the two regions to the opposite ends of the tariff policy spectrum? We find that limits to Asian tariff policy autonomy may have lowered tariffs substantially there, but by themselves they cannot explain why Asian tariffs were so much lower than the Latin American tariffs before 1914; that natural barriers, domestic political economy and strategic tariff policy seems to have contributed much to the difference and that the origins of Asian post-World War 2 import-substitution policies seem to lie in the interwar years when Asian tariff levels caught up with those of Latin America.","[Clemens, Michael A.] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Harvard Univ, Madison, WI 53703 USA; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53703 USA",Harvard University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Clemens, MA (通讯作者)，Ctr Global Dev, 1800 Massachusetts Ave NW,3rd Floor, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",mclemens@cgdev.org; jwilliam@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,57,6,6,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

The paper provides some of the first estimates of how EPHI affects the use of health care services in a Scandinavian context. The effect of EPHI is estimated using propensity score matching. This method is shown to provide plausible estimates given the institutional setting of EPHI in Denmark and a wide set of relevant covariates. Considering the full sample of occupationally active, it is found that EPHI does not significantly affect the probability of having had any hospitalisations, physiotherapist, chiropractor, psychologist, specialist, or ambulatory contacts within a 12 month period. Restricting the analysis to the subsample of privately employed, the estimated effects for ambulatory contacts and hospitalisation are somewhat higher and statistically significant. More precisely, it is found that EPHI increases the probability of hospitalisation from 5.1 to 8.5% and the probability of having had any ambulatory contacts from 17.9 to 23.3% among the privately employed.","[Kiil, Astrid] AKF Danish Inst Govt Res, DK-1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Kiil, Astrid] Univ So Denmark, COHERE Ctr Hlth Econ Res, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Kiil, A (通讯作者)，AKF Danish Inst Govt Res, Kobmagergade 22, DK-1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",aki@akf.dk,,,,,,,95,8,10,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The analysis is set in the context of how development policy thinking on the part of both scholars and international organizations has evolved over several decades. Many of the previously accepted arguments have been called into question by the impacts of globalization and a new response to these issues has emerged, a response both to these global changes and also to nonspatial development approaches. The debates are highlighted in the context of a series of major reports recently published on the topic. The cases of the developing world and the European Union are used as examples of how in this changing context development intervention should increasingly focus on efficiency and social inclusion at the expense of an emphasis on territorial convergence and how strategies should consider economic, social, political, and institutional diversity in order to maximize both the local and the aggregate potential for economic development.","[McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Groningen; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,,fabrizio.barca@tesoro.it; p.mccann@rug.nl; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",,,,,86,749,792,2,175,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This presents two alternative ways forward-'revolution', the establishment of a panel to establish initial guidelines, or 'evolution'aEurothe more gradual development of such guidelines over time. The third alternative of 'status quo', representing the current state of play, is seen as the base case scenario.

In practice, ecotourism has often failed to deliver the expected benefits to indigenous communities due to a combination of factors, including shortages in the endowments of human, financial and social capital within the community, lack of mechanisms for a fair distribution of the economic benefits of ecotourism, and land insecurity. Based on a review of experiences, we analyze the complex interaction among the factors shaping the success and failure of ecotourism experiences in indigenous communities, and we stress the need for a better approach to enhance the indigenous communities' livelihood possibilities coming from ecotourism, as well as to promote land tenure and communities' empowerment.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consisted of a survey of 421 wine consumers using the best-worst scaling methodology. Various consumer segmentations were made by gender, income and age groups. Findings - The two main attributes that condition consumers in choosing wine are previous tasting and region of origin. The latter attribute is valued mainly by women and in general by consumers over 34 years old who have a net monthly family income above (sic)1,500. The previously tasted attribute, which on many occasions is associated with the price attribute, is valued basically by men and particularly by younger consumers and those with lower incomes. Practical implications - It must be pointed out that in the short term the basic strategy of wine-producing enterprises from any given region of origin is to compete on price. However, in the long term increasing their prestige is all that remains to compete actively with the various regions of origin. Originality/value - This paper contributes to a greater knowledge of Spanish consumer habits by analysing the most important wine attributes in the process of purchasing wine.","[Bernabeu, Rodolfo; Olmeda, Miguel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agronomos, Albacete, Spain; [Diaz, Monica] Univ Castilla La Mancha, EU Ingn Tecn Agr, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Olivas, Raquel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Desarrollo Reg, Albacete, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Bernabéu, R (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agronomos, Albacete, Spain.",Rodolfo.Bernabeu@uclm.es,,,"European Social Fund; Government of Castilla-La Mancha Commercial analysis of organic farming in Castilla-La Mancha, in the frame of the Operative Program ESF","European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Government of Castilla-La Mancha Commercial analysis of organic farming in Castilla-La Mancha, in the frame of the Operative Program ESF","The authors thank the European Social Fund and the Government of Castilla-La Mancha for supporting PBI08-0258 Research Project Commercial analysis of organic farming in Castilla-La Mancha, in the frame of the Operative Program ESF 2007-2013.",,56,32,35,2,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, previous economic research focusing on the socio-economic characteristics of organic food consumers yields mixed findings. One explanation for the literature's inconsistent findings is that most studies rely on one specific product or one region of the country, or base their analysis on data collected from in-store surveys. Another shortcoming in the existing literature is the failure to account for how access to organic food influences the likelihood of buying organic food. This paper's goal is to identify what is known, as well as what is not known, about consumers of organic food. Design/methodology/approach - The paper extends the literature through the combination of a novel approach and unique dataset of US consumers, and addresses the relationship between demographic traits and the likelihood of buying organic food. The dataset consists of primary data recording all purchases of food as well as household demographic data, such as income, education, gender, and ethnicity, over a one-year period for 44,000 households. The study uses different discrete choice models and multiple product categories to explore the likelihood of buying organic food from many angles, in order to assess the robustness of the statistical relationship between income, education, ethnicity, and other factors on the likelihood of buying organic food, as well as the frequency of buying organic food. Findings - The results indicate that education has a strong effect on the likelihood of buying organic products, and that the impact of marital status, income, and access to organic are consistent across models. The findings also suggest that further research on the links between ethnicity and consumption of organic food is necessary. Research limitations/implications - One possible drawback to this dataset is that older, urban households are overrepresented, in comparison to the entire USA. Practical implications - These findings will appeal to those interested in consumer behavior in addition to those interested in organic food consumption, from both the research and trade perspectives. The research indicates that access to organic food is an important determinant of the likelihood of a household buying organic food, the industry in the USA can expand sales by increasing consumer access to organic food. Originality/value - This paper's unique contribution is the exploration of the robustness of the impact of different factors on the likelihood of buying organic food. The inclusion of access to organic food is also new to the literature, and as expected, households with greater access to organic food are more likely to purchase organic food.","[Dimitri, Carolyn] NYU, Dept Nutr Food Studies & Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Dettmann, Rachael L.] Drake Univ, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA",New York University; Drake University,"Dimitri, C (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Nutr Food Studies & Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10003 USA.",Carolyn.dimitri@nyu.edu,,,,,,,33,101,115,0,65,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Products were bought within Norway, with national and international origins. Design/methodology/approach - The method used structured interviews and questionnaires at each link in the production and supply chain of 30 products in order to discover the ability to identify the origin of product, the size of batches used during production, the potential product and process information available and the estimated time of recall in an emergency situation. Findings - The results showed that it was possible to trace 53 percent of the products bought through their supply chains to their origin. The results demonstrated that mixing transformations create challenges for traceability that are more severe than other types of transformations. Company motivation is an important factor in creating the conditions for a successful tracing event. Social implications - The study presents findings that can be used by the food producing industry and regulators that will aid in improving the ability to track and trace food effectively.

During his career, Leopold witnessed several cases of land degradation that were caused by unbridled economic activity. The objective of this article is to examine two sets of draft proposals prepared by Leopold for the purpose of rethinking economics along conservation and ecological principles. The first is a set of four draft prospectuses written during the 1930s to pursue research on conservation economics. The focus here was on developing economic tools to promote conservation. The second is a draft memo written in late 1947 to propose creating a position in ecological economics at the University of Wisconsin, with the conservationist William Vogt (1902-1968) as candidate. Leopold was inspired by the work of Vogt in analyzing human-land interaction according to ecological principles. Unfortunately, Leopold passed away in April 1948. This article concludes with a discussion of Vogt's thinking on conservation up to that time, including his 1948 book Road to Survival, to provide a sense of the foundational work that would have gone into the development of Leopold and Vogt's ecological economics.

Modifications of water governance are the outcome of interrelated changes in the determinants of actor-specific perceptions of costs and benefits of governance. To become effective, actors need to be able to bring their preferences to bear on constitutionally defined action situations where collective bargaining processes over governance take shape. Rescaling is conceptualized as being about whose economic interests are able to control the processes by which rescaling is advocated and carried out and whose technically, economically, or politically oriented vision of water management prevails. The framework developed goes beyond the alternatives of either functionalist problem-solving approaches or approaches focussing on political bargaining. Its application is illustrated through an in-depth qualitative case study of decentralization of governance in Spain's Guadalquivir river basin. Here, rescaling resulted from some politically dominant regional actors favoring better coordination of water management with regional environmental management and greater control of water and coincided with a political two-level majority at the national and regional levels. The case highlights the role of relations between institutional arrangements and biophysical settings, such as the specific geographical setting and changes in the relative importance of characteristics of the nature-related transactions, implicit, for example, in the changing relative importance groundwater management at the expense of surface water management.

Although this notion is well-established, it remains difficult to assess how the biophysical features of a specific area contribute towards the well-being of the people attached to it We explore this topic using the case of four areas in Germany and Austria by performing open, single-question interviews with 262 respondents. Data reveal an outstanding relevance of nonmaterial values. Linkages between landscapes and human well-being are tied to specific features of the material environment but, likewise, practices and experiences play an important role in the creation and acknowledgment of such values. Our results accord with the conceptual outline of the cultural values model but fit to a lesser degree into the ecosystem services framework. Due to the high relevance of experiential factors, providing manifold opportunities for people to engage with their natural surroundings should be considered a strategy for fostering human well-being.

To manage these waters, states have developed a large set of formal treaties, but until now these treaties have been difficult to access and systematically assess. This paper presents and makes publicly available the assembly and organization of the largest known collection of transboundary water agreements in existence. We apply for the first time a lineage concept to differentiate between independent agreements and groups of legally related texts, spatially reference the texts to a global basin database, and identify agreement purposes, goals and a variety of content areas. The 688 agreements identified were signed between 1820 and 2007 and constitute 250 independent treaties which apply to 113 basins. While the scope and content varies widely, these treaties nominally govern almost 70 % of the world's transboundary basin area. In terms of content, treaties have shifted from an earlier focus on regulation and development of water resources to the management of resources and the setting of frameworks for that management. While traditional issues such as hydropower, water allocation and irrigation are still important, the environment is now the most commonly mentioned issue in treaty texts. Treaties are also increasingly likely to include data and information sharing provisions, have conflict resolution mechanisms, and include mechanisms for participation beyond traditional nation-state actors. Generalizing, treaties have become more comprehensive over time, both in the issues they address and the tools they use to manage those issues cooperatively.","[Giordano, Mark] Int Water Management Inst, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Giordano, Mark] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv ICC 301, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Drieschova, Alena] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Duncan, James A.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, S Burlington, VT 05403 USA; [Sayama, Yoshiko] Japan Off Cosmos Aoyama B1F, ICLEI Local Govt Sustainabil, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo 1500001, Japan; [De Stefano, Lucia] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Geol Sci, Geodynam Dept, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Wolf, Aaron T.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); Georgetown University; University of Toronto; University of Vermont; Complutense University of Madrid; Oregon State University,"Giordano, M (通讯作者)，Int Water Management Inst, POB 2075, Colombo, Sri Lanka.",Mark.giordano@cgiar.org,"De Stefano, Lucia/H-2085-2015","De Stefano, Lucia/0000-0002-9612-7051",,,,,56,80,86,2,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

However, plantation forests differ dramatically from natural forests in the types of ecosystem services they can provide. As a result, it is important to understand the aggregate effects of plantation expansion on natural forests. Using a simple partial equilibrium model and a global panel dataset of forest statistics, this paper assesses the impacts of plantation expansion upon the extent of natural forests. The analysis shows that plantation expansion has resulted in a contraction of natural forests dedicated to forest product extraction, but an expansion of un-harvested natural forests and the associated generation of ecosystem services. The model and empirical evidence emphasize, however, that there is significant heterogeneity in this outcome depending upon the own-price elasticity of demand for forest products and, as a result, the trade intensity of the forestry sector. The potential for beneficial effects of plantation expansion on un-harvested natural forests is diminished in countries with trade-oriented forestry sectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we synthesize available data on the importance of wild food as ecosystem service, its spatial distribution and relations between supply, demand and benefits in the European Union (EU), covering all terrestrial wild food groups. A wide variety of game (38 species), mushrooms (27 species) and vascular plants (81 species) is collected and consumed throughout the EU. Income, age, gender, possibilities for collecting, and cultural factors explain the importance of wild food. While the economic and nutritional values of wild food comprise a few thousands of the GDP or total consumption, over 100 million EU citizens consume wild food. Collecting wild food is an appreciated recreational activity; collecting and consuming wild food provide important cultural ecosystem services, including recreation and sense of place. Because of these benefits, wild food should be included in EU ecosystem service assessments. Better estimates could be made if better data on wild food abundance and production are available and by systematic inventories of participation in wild food collecting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluate one such investment-a greenway along the Meramec River in St. Louis County, Missouri. We estimate the opportunity costs, the avoided flood damages, and the capitalization of proximity to protected lands into nearby home prices. To estimate avoided flood damages, we undertake a parcel-level analysis using the Hazus-MH flood model, a GIS-based model developed for FEMA that couples a hydrology and hydraulics model with a damage model relating flood depths to property damage. We examine the distribution of damages across parcels, demonstrating that careful spatial targeting can increase the net benefits of floodplain conservation. In addition, we estimate a hedonic model and find that the increased property values for homes near protected lands are more than three times larger than the avoided flood damages, stressing the continued importance of more traditional conservation values, The proximity benefits alone exceed the opportunity costs; the avoided flood damages further strengthen the economic case for floodplain conservation.

While scholars and policy-makers all want ecosystem based management (EBM), few, if any, have achieved it in practice. Adaptive governance promises effective EBM, but guidance remains elusive. Looking back to an ecosystem people such as the indigenous Maori in the south of New Zealand and analyzing their resource management system using Ostrom's (1990) eight-principle framework for common property rights regimes allows us to answer three central questions. How did Ngai Tahu, the dominant tribe on the South Island, manage the complex linkages, uncertainty and interactions with nature while exploiting their environment? Was resource exploitation sustainable? And what can be drawn from their management system for modern governance structures? The application of Ostrom's framework shows that kaitiakitanga (stewardship) as an integrated management system generally aligns with the principles necessary for successful EBM and provided Ngai Tahu with the necessary tools to control and adapt measures across space and time, mirroring the modern tenets of adaptive management. Studying a people that practiced EBM successfully provides the insight that EBM may be achieved by governing ecosystems through an integrated common property management system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Improving forest conservation efforts requires a better understanding of how policies influence forest resources management, hence a need for better analysis of policy coherence and interaction. This study employs a content analysis of national sectoral policies in agriculture, energy and forestry, and national programmes under United Nations Rio conventions in Zambia to examine coherence and interplay between international- and national-level policies. Results show positive horizontal interplay between energy and forestry policies, while conflicts were observed between the agricultural and forestry policies despite the potential of conservation farming to provide a mutually supportive link. Policy documents show inconsistencies between national sectoral policies and national statements to the Rio conventions. Additionally, although national statements to Rio conventions share common ground on measures to address deforestation, they seem to be poorly mainstreamed into national policies and broader development policies at national level. Findings have further revealed a lack of coherence between national commitments to Rio conventions and national forest legislation. The paper concludes that although developing countries, such as Zambia, are ratifying international environmental conventions, measures are often not drafted into national policies and linkages remain largely superficial.","[Kalaba, Felix Kanungwe] Copperbelt Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Kitwe, Zambia; [Quinn, Claire Helen; Dougill, Andrew John] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Copperbelt University; University of Leeds,"Kalaba, FK (通讯作者)，Copperbelt Univ, Sch Nat Resources, POB 21692, Kitwe, Zambia.",kanungwe@gmail.com,"Kalaba, Felix Kanungwe/AAE-8838-2019; Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020","Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228; Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,77,45,48,1,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The World Input-output Database is used to estimate EET in 40 countries during 1995-2007 after which a structural decomposition analysis is applied. To avoid biases in the results, we have used the input-output tables in previous year's prices and chained the outcomes. In many developed countries, the growth of emissions embodied in imports is much higher than the growth of emissions embodied in exports. A key reason for this finding is the change in the structure of trade, both in intermediate and in final products. Emerging economies like the BRIC countries have increased their share in production and trade at the expense of developed countries. Producers and consumers in developed countries have shifted towards importing a larger share of products from emerging countries. This is the distinguishing feature that led to an increase of emissions embodied in imports for developed countries and an increase of emissions embodied in exports for emerging countries. These results suggest policy makers to monitor EET more carefully and take the effects of trade on emissions into consideration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, risk was never considered in the papers based on profit decomposition. Without considering risk, the empirical results will be biased while decomposing the change in profit. In fact, risk is a joint but undesirable output which cannot be freely disposed of by various regulations. The non-performing loan (NPL) is employed as a risk indicator for decomposing the change in profit in this study. This study also performs a three-way comparison among (1) the original Grifell-Tatj, and Lovell (Manag Sci 45:1177-1193, 1999) analysis (OGLA) model that ignores NPL, (2) the extended Grifell-Tatj, and Lovell (Manag Sci 45:1177-1193, 1999) analysis (EGLA) model that is based on the OGLA model and incorporates NPL, and (3) the directional distance function (DDF) model that is based on Juo et al. (Omega 40:550-561, 2012) and incorporates NPLs to see if incorporating the undesirable output matters. The decomposition of the change in profit in the above three models is then illustrated using Taiwanese banks over the period 2006-2010.","Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, Guishan Shiang 33306, Taoyuan County, Taiwan",,"Juo, JC (通讯作者)，Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, 300,Sec 1,Wanshou Rd, Guishan Shiang 33306, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.",it021@mail.lhu.edu.tw,,,,,,,38,13,13,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We provide an alternative measure of productivity growth by estimating a translog variable cost function, with parameters that separate productivity growth due to technical change from that due to the effects of returns to scale, capacity utilisation and natural resource inputs. The results show that the average MFP growth in Australian mining based on the dual cost-function measure of technical change is 2 % over the sample period 1974-1975 to 2007-2008, rather than -0.2 % from the published index. The difference arises because declining natural resource inputs, the effects of capacity utilisation and returns to scale have all reduced the 'true' MFP growth.","[Zheng, Simon; Bloch, Harry] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Zheng, S (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",szheng04001172@gmail.com,"Bloch, Harry/A-9591-2008; Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019","Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925",,,,,18,12,13,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

When only aggregate data are available, it is customary to calibrate the model based on market shares as data input, even if the data are available in the form of aggregate counts. However, market shares are functionally related to model primitives in the random coefficients model whereas finite aggregate counts are only probabilistic functions of these model primitives. A recent paper by Park and Gupta (Journal of Marketing Research, 46(4), 531-543 2009) stresses this distinction but is hamstrung by numerical problems when demonstrating its potential practical importance. We develop Bayesian inference for the likelihood function proposed by Park and Gupta (Journal of Marketing Research, 46(4), 531-543 2009), sidestepping the numerical problem encountered by these authors. We show how taking account of the amount of information about shares by modeling counts directly results in improved inference.","[Zenetti, German] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Otter, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Zenetti, G (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",german.zenetti@hu-berlin.de; Otter@marketing.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,31,5,5,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We derive the equilibrium payoffs of this coalitional game and investigate the impact of the asymmetry assumption on the extreme schemes of cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria. We then proceed to the computation of stable coalitions using time-consistent harvest-sharing policies for the partial coordination scheme, in the case where players are divided into two groups (high and low discount rates). We find that asymmetry has a significant impact on the way the resource is shared and on the profitability of coalitions. We also find that asymmetry is not a sufficient feature to overcome the puzzle of small coalitions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the factors that influence insurance companies' demand for reinsurance. Both insurers-specific and the reinsurance industry-specific factors are analysed. The empirical analysis is based on panel data consisting of all insurance companies in Croatian insurance market in the period from 2003 to 2011.

Design/methodology/approach - To facilitate this approach, this paper reports on the composition and in vitro micronutrient accessibility of 14 traditional mung bean foods from India in relation to their preparation methods. Findings - Proximate composition, in vitro mineral accessibility, phytic acid and polyphenol contents varied among the range of products. Products requiring either fermentation or germination, had higher in vitro iron, zinc and calcium accessibility. Average in vitro iron, zinc and calcium accessibility of the mung bean products were 16, 9 and 418 mg kg (1) dry weight. Phytic acid and polyphenols averaged 2.1 and 1.8 g kg(-1) dry weight, respectively, and were negatively correlated with in vitro mineral accessibility. Practical implications - Different mung bean products (100 g) cover 12.0-59.5, 5.2-45.6, 4.2-28.6 and 1.1-7.1 per cent of the recommended dietary allowance for protein, iron, zinc and calcium, respectively, for seven- to nine-year-old Indian children.

Furthermore, it explores the impact of consumer attribute knowledge, usage frequency, education and opinion strength on the magnitude of direct and indirect effects. Design/methodology/approach - Data are collected through an online experiment with 460 US consumers and analyzed with path modeling. Findings - The Australian label generates a 86 percent negative direct effect vs a 14 percent negative indirect effect on consumer attitudes, which means that US consumers do not make strong inferences to form their attitudes toward buying Australian beef. The animal welfare label generates 50 percent direct and 50 percent indirect effects. The grass-fed label generates only indirect effects (100 percent). The higher consumer education, attribute knowledge, usage frequency, education and opinion strength, the weaker are the indirect effects of credence labels. Research limitations/implications - The study focusses on consumers in one country (USA), one product (beef steak) and one label across three attributes, therefore generalization of results is limited. Practical implications - The study offers a tool to agribusiness managers as well as to policy makers, NGOs and consumer groups to design and assess the effectiveness of communication campaigns attempting to strengthen (or weaken) consumer inferences and attitudes relative to credence labels. Originality/value - Despite the wide literature on consumer inferences based on credence labels, this is the first study that quantitatively disentangles the complex set of inferential effects generated by credence labels and explores common relationships across multiple credence attributes.","[Dentoni, Domenico] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Management Studies Grp, Sch Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Tonsor, Glynn T.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Calantone, Roger] Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Business Sch, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Peterson, H.

The study identifies the main difficulties faced by firms during the adoption process, the benefits obtained, and the most influential benefits on firms overall satisfaction with ISO 22000. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was developed to identify the difficulties and benefits for ISO 22000 implementation. Data were collected among 189 Spanish certified firms. Factor analysis and multiple linear regression were used. Findings - ISO 22000 is used by firms operating in all links of the food chain (FC). Size of the firm is not a factor that determines its implementation. Exporter firms are more attracted to ISO 22000 certification. All sample firms experienced difficulties throughout the implementation process, being those related with time and money the most relevant. The benefits which most contributed to the firms' satisfaction were internal in nature, in particular, those related to improved efficiency and food safety. Practical implications - Despite the many difficulties, both material and organizational, that sample firms experienced in implementing ISO 22000, and the complexity of the standard, the overall satisfaction is high. Originality/value - The sample analyzed comprised certified firms, including representatives of all links in the FC from farm to table.

Their successful commercialisation depends on consumer acceptance, and so it is timely to review the existing literature in this respect. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review identified 42 English language peer reviewed papers assessing public opinion of GM animals associated with food production. Thematic analysis was applied to the results to identify and explain consumer attitudes. Findings - Publication peaked in 2004, and declined thereafter. European consumers were less accepting of GM animal technology than the US and Asian consumers, although the latter reported more ethical concern. Risk and benefit perceptions, ethical concerns (e.g. related to animal welfare) may explain negative consumer attitudes towards animals in food production. Research limitations/implications - There is a lack of data on consumer attitudes to GM animals applied to food production, in particular in relation to consumers in emerging economies and developing countries. This is problematic as applications of GM animal products are about to enter the market. Practical implications - There is a need to track changes in public opinion as GM food production animals are further developed. The introduction and commercialisation of applications with specific characteristics may further shape consumer attitudes. Social implications - Methods need to be developed to involve consumers and other stakeholders in shaping future applications of agri-food applications of GM animals. Originality/value - The review collates existing quantitative and qualitative knowledge regarding the drivers of consumer attitudes towards GM animals used in food production using systematic review methodology.","[Frewer, Lynn J.; Coles, David] Newcastle Univ, Food & Soc Grp, Ctr Rural Econ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Houdebine, Louis-Marie] INRA, Reprod & Dev Biol Unit, Jouy En Josas, France; [Kleter, Gijs A.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, RIKILT Inst Food Safety, Wageningen, Netherlands",Newcastle University - UK; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; Wageningen University & Research,"Frewer, LJ (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Food & Soc Grp, Ctr Rural Econ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",lynn.frewer@newcastle.ac.uk,,"Coles, David/0000-0003-4774-4800; Kleter, Gijs A./0000-0001-7030-1149","European Commission - European 7th Framework Programme [226465]; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture & Innovation's Knowledge Base (KB) Programme","European Commission - European 7th Framework Programme; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture & Innovation's Knowledge Base (KB) Programme","The research reported here has been funded as part of the European Commission contract 226465, PEGASUS, Public Perception of Genetically modified Animals - Science, Utility and Society, funded by the European 7th Framework Programme, and by generous support from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture & Innovation's Knowledge Base (KB) Programme.

To regain consumer confidence in the quality and safety of the product new policies, such as advanced traceability and identity preservation systems in the fisheries and aquaculture industry have been suggested. The purpose of this paper is to examine consumers' preferences to pay a premium price for certified farmed Atlantic salmon that is passed through various quality and traceability systems in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the contingent valuation (CV) method by estimating a probit regression model to assess consumers' preferences for certified farmed Atlantic salmon. In particular, the paper measures consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) a premium price to purchase the product. The CV method is the most widely used methodology in measuring individuals' attitudes toward purchasing certified products. To estimate the parameters of the model, the authors carried out a consumer survey in spring 2010 and successfully completed 120 questionnaires in the province. Findings - The paper provides empirical insights about how households are interested in consuming certified farm-raised Atlantic salmon by paying an additional premium price to purchase the product. The results of the study show that although consumers believe that traceability methods, on average, will increase the price of certified farmed Atlantic salmon their preferences toward the consumption of the product will not be changed. Research limitations/implications - Since the paper uses the CV method to evaluate individuals' preferences for certified farm-raised Atlantic salmon, the authors also suggest another study that uses a non-hypothetical choice experimental approach to elicit households' WTP a premium price for the product. Originality/value - This paper shows how consumers' decisions to purchase certified farm-raised Atlantic salmon can be affected by a series of demographic, socio-economicand other variables that reflect consumers' awareness of issues surroundings farmed Atlantic salmon and quality assurance.","Mem Univ, Corner Brook, NF, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland,"Haghiri, M (通讯作者)，Mem Univ, Grenfell Campus, Corner Brook, NF, Canada.",mhaghiri@mun.ca,,,,,,,40,17,20,1,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional intercept survey of 402 consumers in two cities in New Zealand was conducted. Respondents were asked to describe what they had considered when selecting a food item in their trolley. This was followed by questions to assess respondents' knowledge of CoO and their use and understanding of common CoO labels. Findings - Price (42 per cent), taste (40 per cent), health (18 per cent), and quality (18 per cent) were the most important factors that respondents mentioned. Only 3.5 per cent of respondents mentioned CoO as one of the factors influencing their decision. Of respondents 61 per cent, when prompted, stated that they knew the CoO of the food product selected. Of these respondents, 90 per cent were correct. Of respondents 62 per cent stated that they look at CoO labels when making food purchase decisions. Yet, only one third of respondents correctly understood the difference between the Made in and Product of labels. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that consumers that do access CoO labels are misinterpreting this information which may form the basis of their assumptions about the source of origin of the brands and food products they routinely purchase. Practical implications - Mandatory CoO labelling policies may add costs and reinforce misconceptions that consumers already hold about the meaning of these labels. Originality/value - This study contributes to understanding of the extent to which consumers are competent in their knowledge and understanding of these informational labels.","[Insch, Andrea] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Jackson, Erin] Fonterra, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Insch, A (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.",andrea.insch@otago.ac.nz,,"Insch, Andrea/0000-0003-3447-8718",,,,,55,40,41,0,43,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Based on summarizing the results of the authors' research on work motivation measurement with focus on Vroom's expectancy theory, the paper suggests a new vector approach to the work motivation, which provides advanced analytical and predictive possibilities. The method allows to predict the possibility of voluntary termination of employment depending on expected employee's value of motivation. The vector method is offered as a mechanism for major problems of inherent in the typical treatment of expectance theory. The method combines the theoretical variables in a manner that is consistent with the traditional formulation and does not depend on assumptions which conflict with such theories as theory of bounded rationality and prospect theory.","[Ivanov, Dmitry; Polovinko, Vladimir] Omsk FM State Univ, Dept Econ, Omsk 644077, Russia",,"Ivanov, D (通讯作者)，Omsk FM State Univ, Dept Econ, 55A Mira Prospect, Omsk 644077, Russia.",flamencero@mail.ru; pw3@mail.ru,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,507,514,,,,,,8,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700050,0

There are many ways how to define the similarity (or distance respectively). One of the options for a distance definition is based on the Gower's definition of similarity. The weights for particular variables are needed for its calculation. However, in some situations in practice it may not be possible to get the weights directly. Results of an application of two simple general purpose heuristic methods are reported.

The paper works with the value productivity in the contemporary concept which works not only with the efficiency of inputs consumption but also with the efficiency of capital employed (inputs binding). The inputs consumption is expressed as a relation of output value and accounting costs. The efficiency of inputs binding is based on output value and costs of input binding, derived from the costs of total capital employed. It means that it is working with variables as modified economic costs and modified economic profit. This contribution consists of different versions of these indicators.

Therefore the aim of the paper is to evaluate the effect of taxation and its volatility on economic growth in OECD countries for the period the period 2000-2010. Relationship between these variables is explored by dynamic panel regression. The taxation is expressed by traditional tax quota and also by the World Tax Index - designed by the authors of the article. From our results, it is obvious that tax uncertainty expressed by tax quota is positively connected to the economic growth which is contradicting to the theoretical assumption. Anyway, the use of the World Tax Index shows the negative impact of tax uncertainty on economic growth in OECD countries. This means that the World Tax Index seems to be more appropriate approximate of the level of taxation.","[Macek, Rudolf; Kotlan, Igor; Machova, Zuzana] Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Macek, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Vysoka Skola Banska, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",rudolf.macek@vsb.cz; igor.kotlan@vsb.cz; zuzana.machova@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020; Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021; Macek, Rudolf/R-1701-2019","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216; Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600; Macek, Rudolf/0000-0001-7555-9157",,,,,15,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,908,919,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700089,0

Unemployment of young people is associated with considerable costs both for the unemployed and for the whole society. In some respects, the unemployment of young people has more significant negative impacts than unemployment of other age groups. The recent economic recession, which had two phases in the Czech Republic, effected the growth of youth unemployment. The average unemployment rate of young people greatly exceeds the average unemployment rate of other age groups. Even within groups of young people, however, are noticeable differences. The article deals with unemployment of young people by gender and by level of education. Also among young people in the Czech Republic it is true that the higher level of education is connected with lower average unemployment rate. Next to the unemployment rate of young people, the article also focuses on long-term unemployment. It appears that the rate of occurrence of long-term unemployment among young people is lower than in other age groups. Unemployed youth became long-term unemployed to a lesser extent than did other age groups in the Czech Republic. It appears that young people had a higher frequency of unemployment, but its length was shorter on average.","Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pavelka, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churcill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",pavelkat@vse.cz,,,,,,,9,2,2,1,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1106,1114,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700108,0

A Cobb-Douglas production function explains the volume of the production by the amount of production factors and subsidies (SAPS and Top-Up). A true fixed effect model assuming truncated normal distribution of inefficiency term is estimated by maximum likelihood method. In the second step, we use random effects logistic regression to model the influence of technical efficiency on the decision of the farmer to convert the agricultural holding from conventional to organic management scheme. We use unbalanced panel data of Czech farms for the period from 2005 to 2012.

This paper starts by presenting logical arguments suggesting this finding does not hold for goods consumers tire of with use, implying the impact of resale is an empirical question. The empirical impact is then estimated in the market for video games, one of many markets in which producers may soon legally prevent resale by distributing their products digitally as downloads or streamed rentals. Estimation proceeds in two steps. First, demand parameters are estimated using a dynamic discrete choice model in a market with allowed resale, using data on new sales and used trade-ins. Then, using these parameter estimates, prices, profits, and consumer welfare are simulated under counterfactual environments. When resale is allowed, firms are unable to prevent their goods from selling for low prices in later periods. The ability to do so by restricting resale outright yields significant profit increases. Renting, however, does not raise profits as much due to a revenue extraction problem.","Brandeis Univ, Sachar Int Ctr, Waltham, MA 02453 USA",Brandeis University,"Shiller, BR (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Sachar Int Ctr, 415 South St, Waltham, MA 02453 USA.",shiller@brandeis.edu,,"Shiller, Benjamin/0000-0001-9021-1669",,,,,36,13,19,2,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The physical distribution of benefits is, therefore, an important parameter when conducting economic analyses of water restoration projects. Two particularly relevant spatial issues relate to 1) the location of the population relative to the location of the waterbody, and 2) the availability and characteristics of substitute water bodies. Based on a contingent valuation (CV) study of the demand for restoring Odense River in Denmark a spatial demand model which accounts for travel time both to the river subject for valuation and to potential substitute sites is estimated. It is concluded that the spatial distribution of benefits is unlikely to be homogeneously determined by a one-dimensional spatial model. Moreover, the results suggest that the effect of spatial issues on preferences varies between users and non-users. For non-users the spatial impacts from potential substitutes significantly reduce demand for improvements in Odense River. This indicates that focus on estimation of distance decay effects may be an important tool in relation to ensuring proper geographical delimitation of the population in a given context.

This article examines the extent to which William Pitt the Younger, who proposed the new tax, modelled his estimates of national wealth on those produced a century earlier by the pioneers in this field, Sir William Petty, Charles Davenant, and Gregory King. In addition, the calculations of Benjamin Bell and Henry Beeke, two of Pitt's contemporaries, are analysed in detail to highlight the fragility of these contemporary estimates of national income. This analysis has important implications for economic historians who have used this material to try to establish the structure and growth of national output. National accountants during the long eighteenth century were not, for the most part, concerned with structural change. Rather, their descriptions of economic structure should be understood as reflecting a particular set of a priori claims about what they deemed to be the proper mode and distribution of taxation.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Thompson, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,63,2,2,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

As the economic climate worsened, Governments and households were put under increased strain and more focus was placed on prioritising expenditures. Across European countries and their heterogeneous health care systems, this paper examines the initial responsiveness of health expenditures to the crisis and whether recession severity can be considered a predictor of health expenditure growth. In measuring severity we move away from solely gross domestic product (GDP) as a metric and construct a recession severity index predicated on a number of key macroeconomic indicators. We then regress this index on measures of total, public and private health expenditure to identify potential relationships. Analysis suggests that for 2009, the Baltic States, along with Ireland, Italy and Greece, experienced comparatively severe recessions. We find, overall, an initial counter-cyclical response in health spending (both public and private) across countries. However, our analysis finds evidence of a negative relationship between recession severity and changes in certain health expenditures. As a predictor of health expenditure growth in 2009, the derived index is an improvement over GDP change alone.","[Keegan, Conor; Thomas, Steve; Normand, Charles; Portela, Conceicao] Trinity Coll Dublin, Ctr Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Keegan, C (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Ctr Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin, Ireland.",keegancp@tcd.ie,,"Thomas, Steve/0000-0001-9306-0114; Normand, Charles/0000-0002-0885-5754",,,,,25,42,46,0,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The presence of carbon markets should help encourage these activities: however, most carbon trades to date have occurred in the energy sector. A major obstacle to carbon trades from land-use systems is the presence of high transaction costs of converting a carbon offset into a tradable commodity, so the prevailing market carbon prices may not provide enough incentive for adoption. This paper presents a model of the exchange of carbon offsets between a project developer and a group of landholders. The model is solved to derive project feasibility frontiers that show the minimum number of contracts necessary to make a project feasible at any given carbon price. The model is applied to two case studies (smallholder agroforestry in Indonesia and partial reforestation of family farms in Australia) under two types of contract (purchase of carbon flows and rental of carbon stocks). The paper concludes by identifying possible strategies to reduce transaction costs while maintaining project integrity. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While previous research on this bias has exclusively focused on the detection of mode effects, the present study directly assesses a respondent's motivation to state WTP in a socially desirable manner. This study tests the effect of three theoretical motivations for socially desirable responding on WTP responses: A general need for social approval, a perceived social norm calling for a high contribution and perceived lack of anonymity of the interview situation. Questions for the empirical assessment of these factors are developed. Results of a valuation study in Southwest China show differing and independent impacts of these factors. While there is no effect of perceived anonymity, need for social approval biases WTP responses upwards but does not influence the general decision to state a positive WTP. It also turns out that rather the fear of losing social status than the striving for higher social approval is the main driver of this bias. Respondents perceiving a social norm for high WTP are more likely to state a positive WTP, but the specific amount is not affected. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is clear that diversity plays a pivotal role in the resilience building of ecosystems; however, it is less clear what role cultural diversity plays in the resilience building of urban systems. In this paper we provide innovative insights on how common property systems could contribute to urban resilience building. Through a review of recent findings on urban common property systems and the relevant literature, we deal with urban green commons (UGCs) and discuss their potential to manage cultural and biological diversity in cities. We describe three examples of UGCs, i.e. collectively managed parks, community gardens, and allotment areas, with a focus on their institutional characteristics, their role in promoting diverse learning streams, environmental stewardship, and social ecological memory. We discuss how UGCs can facilitate cultural integration through civic participation in urban land-management, conditions for the emergence of UGCs, the importance of cognitive resilience building, and what role property-rights diversity plays in urban settings. We conclude by elucidating some key insights on how UGCs can promote urban resilience building. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Foz Coa case illustrates the methodologies currently adopted under European Union law in the support of public decision concerning large infrastructures with significant impact on the environment and/or the cultural heritage, highlighting their limitations when confronted with the complexity and the plurality of values commonly at stake in such circumstances. We assume that the reasonableness of a public decision is meant to emerge from a process through which the various and conflicting reasons for acting are brought together, implying the opening of ends, and not only of means, to discussion and inquiry, a deliberative perspective which is put in contrast with the monistic methodologies supporting public decision-making under the EIA procedure.

J,"Murphy, AL",,,,"Murphy, Anne L.",,,Demanding 'credible commitment': public reactions to the failures of the early financial revolution,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOVEREIGN DEBT; ENGLAND; INSTITUTIONS; FOUNDATIONS; POLITICS,"North and Weingast's notion of 'credible commitment' arguably offers a reasonable understanding of the factors that allowed the development of a trusting relationship between the state and its potential creditors over the long term. Yet, they failed to recognize the difficulties that were encountered along the way. This article highlights some of those difficulties and shows that at times when credible commitment was in doubt, supporters of the financial revolution held the government to account through the published media and by direct action. This is important for two reasons. First, the contemporary debate regarding the financial revolution, as it is presented by some historians, may lead us to presume that there would have been little public outcry had the government reneged on its debt. Indeed, we might argue that hostility towards financiers had always made default popular with many segments of the population. Yet, clearly opinion was not quite so one-sided and the reaction against potential default was considerable. Second, the fact that the public creditors were willing to act to protect themselves shows that credible commitment was not just created from above by the Glorious Revolution and the subsequent development of the institutions of government; it was demanded from below by the people who invested in the financial revolution. War is quite changed from what it was in the time of our Forefathers; when in a hasty Expedition, and a pitch'd Field, the Matter was decided by Courage ... now the whole Art of War is in a manner reduced to Money ... that Prince, who can best find Money to feed, cloath, and pay his Army, not he that has the most Valiant Troops, is surest of Success and Conquest.(2)","Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Murphy, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",,,"Murphy, Anne L./0000-0003-0138-3480",,,,,46,32,33,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This paper introduces the concept of food consumption value (FCV). Design/methodology/approach - The development of FCV is based upon various research traditions and corresponding bodies of literature. The four constituting parts of FCV origins in different lines of scholarly theorising. These lines of thought are discussed separately. Collectively, they form the breeding ground of the concept of food consumption value. Findings - The consumer-centred framework of FCV consists of four elements. Product value refers to food's features and functionalities like taste or texture. Process value refers to consumers' interest in the practices and processes of food production. Ethical considerations (consumer concerns) are thus taken into account. Furthermore, FCV encompasses location value and emotional value. Location value refers to the setting in which food is purchased or consumed. Emotional value is the most elusive element of FCV, because it refers to feel goods such as experience, entertainment, (sell) indulgence or identity values with respect to the consumption of food products or brands. Practical implications - The message of FCV for (marketing) practitioners in the field of food is that value creation should depart from assessing consumer value in narrow senses such as value for money. The feelings that foods can arouse are anything but valueless intangibilities, but crucial assets of value creation and competitiveness. Another practical implication of FCV is that for value creation in the food supply chain it is a sine qua non that downstream (location value) and upstream (process value) are fine-tuned consistently and constructively. Originality/value - This paper is the first exploratory study on the development of the new concept of FCV that examines consumer value beyond tangible product attributes and price. This broader concept of FCV aims to interpret value in terms that adjust to today's consumer-oriented food market. Though inspired by other interpretations of value in marketing and food studies, FCV differs from these.","[Dagevos, Hans] Wageningen UR, LEI, The Hague, Netherlands; [van Ophem, Johan] Wageningen UR, ECH, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Dagevos, H (通讯作者)，Wageningen UR, LEI, The Hague, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,71,50,54,0,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper's approach is a systematic review of the Web of Science, Medline/Pubmed and Scielo-Br electronic databases, from 2001 to 2011. Of the 256 abstracts initially retrieved, those reporting development of products containing inulin were included, while those regarding literature review, clinical investigations, inulin extraction and effects on the human body were excluded. Full papers of all the 28 studies identified as relevant to the aims of the review were then obtained. Findings - Inulin quantities added to products varied from 1 to 32 per cent. Products containing inulin had improved microorganism counts and received either equal or better scores in sensory analysis tests. pH and colour of high fat content products were not significantly altered by inulin addition. Texture profile of high protein and carbohydrate content products was irregularly altered by inulin addition. Food composition was found to determine the necessary amount of inulin to induce the desired changes. Highest added quantities were observed in the group of products with high carbohydrate content. Originality/value - The paper presents a compilation of information regarding inulin percentage needed to alter physicochemical and sensory characteristics of products with different protein, fat and carbohydrate content.","[Kuntz, Marilyn G.

It is presumed that mixing land uses yields socioeconomic benefits and therefore has a positive effect on housing values. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mixed land use on housing values using semiparametric estimation techniques. We demonstrate that a diverse neighborhood is positively valued by households. There are various land use types that have a positive impact on house prices, e.g., business services and leisure. Land uses that are incompatible with residential land use are, among others, manufacturing and wholesale. It appears that households are willing to pay about 2.5 percent more for a house in a mixed neighborhood. We also show that there is substantial heterogeneity in willingness to pay for mixed land use. For example, only apartment occupiers are willing to pay for an increase in diversity, whereas households living in other house types are not willing to pay for diversity.","[Koster, Hans R.

The dataset, not used before for anthropometry, documents men born between 1800 and 1849. Mostly purchased from slave owners, they were recruited into the Dutch army to serve in the Dutch East Indies. We find that height development was stagnant between 1800 and 1830 and deteriorated strongly during the 1840s. In international comparison and after taking selectivity issues into account, these Ghanaian and Burkinabe recruits were notably shorter than northwestern Europeans but not shorter than southern Europeans during this period.","[Austin, Gareth] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Baten, Joerg] Univ Tubingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Utrecht University,"Austin, G (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,"van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298; , Joerg/0000-0001-5029-501X",,,,,57,22,22,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

One of them is the G20. When G20 leaders around the world convened in London to restore global economies, they stressed the importance of a 'resilient, sustainable, and green recovery' and reaffirmed their commitments to address climate change. This was followed by their agreement on phasing out inefficient fossil fuel energy subsidies over the medium term in Pittsburgh. The 'coexistence of narrow regimes in the same issue-area' could be described as 'regime complexes', which enable countries to adapt more readily, particularly when adaptation requires complex changes in norms and behavior. Given that responses to climate change would require changes in the domestic politics of different countries at different levels, loosely integrated institutions of regime complexes could be more advantageous for countries to adapt and in engaging with developing countries. This paper demonstrates that the G20's highly informal institutional setup as well as its flexible cooperation tools could enable its members to customize their policies and better engage with third-party countries. In addition, the G20 group could collectively influence other key countries to reach an agreement on some of the key climate change-related issues, thereby facilitating the United Nations process of climate change.","[Kim, Joy Aeree] UNEP, Econ & Trade Branch, Div Technol Ind & Econ, F-75009 Paris, France; [Chung, Suh-Yong] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Kim, JA (通讯作者)，UNEP, Econ & Trade Branch, Div Technol Ind & Econ, 15 Rue Millan, F-75009 Paris, France.",joysky.kim@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,23,23,0,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Didymo degrades river esthetics, alters ecosystems, negatively impacts recreation experiences and may require strict containment measures. This paper assesses the impact of Didymo on non market values for recreational angling using a case study from New Zealand, where Didymo is extraordinarily prolific. Choice experiment data are used to fit a latent class model, identifying five distinct angler preference profiles. For the largest class of anglers the presence of Didymo had no significant effect on angling benefits. However, other classes were negatively affected. Overall, Didymo reduced fishing values by about NZ$44 per visit. Anglers were sensitive to the scale of Didymo infestation, suffering significantly higher costs when more water bodies are affected. Closure of Didymo-infected mainstem-rivers to prevent spread of Didymo resulted in a significant reduction in angler net benefits, even if the policy were 100% effective. The latent class model identified distributional implications. While three angler classes would not have significantly different benefits if mainstem-rivers were closed to prevent the spread of Didymo, two classes of anglers would be highly impacted by such a policy, particularly those who regularly fish mainstem-rivers for salmon.

Jevons displays an interest for the problem of resource depletion, and some opportunism linked to the treatment of a subject in vogue at the time. The Coal Question is retrospectively essentially known for having pointed out the first bases of what we call today the rebound effect, known as well as the Jevons' paradox. No one can deny the major contribution Jevons did by insisting on the energy efficiency paradoxical phenomenon. However, this is not the only interesting idea proposed in The Coal Question. This article aims at drawing a larger framework of the ideas developed by Jevons, looking at some specific points that testify to his position as a turning point in the history of environmental studies. We see that Jevons expresses a desire of emancipation from both natural sciences and engineering, yet without ignoring the necessity of interdisciplinary perspectives to deal with environmental matters. It places Jevons as a pioneer of several modern approaches towards environmental economics, including ecological economics. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Cohn, S",,,,"Cohn, Samuel, Jr.",,,Renaissance attachment to things: material culture in last wills and testaments,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FAMILY,"Over the past decade 'material culture' has become a sub-discipline of Italian Renaissance studies. This literature, however, has focused on the rich and their objects preserved in museums or reflected in paintings. In addition, the period 1300 to 1600 has been treated without attention to changes in the relationship between people and possessions. The article turns to last wills and testaments, which survive in great numbers and sink deep roots through late medieval and Renaissance cities and their hinterlands. They reveal aspirations and anxieties about things from post-mortem repairs to farm houses to pillows of monk's wool. These aspirations changed fundamentally after the Black Death. Earlier, during the 'commercial revolution', ordinary merchants, artisans, and peasants on their deathbeds practised what the mendicants preached: stripping themselves of their possessions, they converted their estates to coin to be scattered among pious and non-pious beneficiaries. After the Black Death, testators began to reverse tack, devising ever more complex legal strategies to govern the future flow of their goods. This work of the dead had larger economic consequences. By encouraging the liquidation of estates, the earlier mendicant ideology quickened the velocity of exchange, while the early Renaissance attachment to things did the opposite.","Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Cohn, S (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,91,21,28,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The chronology of that decline is unclear due to a lack of quantitative evidence. This article examines detailed colliery records from a crucial period of industrial transition and shows that traditional patterns of attendance and work effort survived in one of the leading sectors of the industrial revolution well into the second half of the nineteenth century.

One indicator of human capital frequently used for the pre-1900 period is age heaping, which has been increasingly used to measure gender-specific differences. In this note, we find that in some historical samples, married women heap significantly less than unmarried women. This is still true after correcting for possible selection effects. A possible explanation is that a percentage of women adapted their ages to that of their husbands, hence biasing the Whipple index. We find the same effect to a lesser extent for men. Since this bias differs over time and across countries, a consistent comparison of female age heaping should be made by focusing on unmarried women.","[Foldvari, Peter] Univ Utrecht, Debrecen Univ Med, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Warwick, Univ Utrecht, Free Univ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Utrecht University; University of Warwick,"Földvári, P (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Debrecen Univ Med, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298",,,,,28,17,17,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

A literature review is conducted, in the most important academic journals of management, to understand the general research on aligning program management and business strategy. Then a qualitative approach, based on upon grounded theory methodology, is adopted for this research. The results are primarily taken in a case-study, in a multinational company, with the aim of fully understanding the nature of program management practices.

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether milk prices fell to their marginal value in the least remunerative use or whether the market had put in place some other mechanism for raising the price upwards. Design/methodology/approach - An on-line survey of UK milk producers, open to all, conducted in the summer of 2008, explored farmers' knowledge of their milk contract, the use of their milk, and the reasons for choosing their current milk buyer. Findings - A liquid milk price premium (of 1.06ppl.) was earned by farmers who: sold on liquid milk contracts to processors, rather than to one of the three large farmer-owned co-operatives; and who recently switched milk buyer. Switching incurred high,transaction costs, additional uncertainty, and went against commitments to the co-operative ideal. Practical implications - Publication of differences between a buyer's milk price and a benchmark related to how the milk is processed, (a D-score), cumulative difference values (D_C), 12 and 24 monthly moving average difference measures (D_MAl2 and D_MA24 respectively) alongside milk buyers' milk price would improved supply chain transparency, and lower farmers' switching costs. It would also help farmers to treat their milk's final markets, rather than their milk buyer, as their customers. Originality/value - The paper puts forward practical suggestions that have never been discussed by the UK supply chain, even though they would have direct and indirect benefits to the actors involved.","[Franks, Jeremy; Hauser, Sarah] Newcastle Univ, SAFRD, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Franks, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, SAFRD, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",J.R.Franks@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,1,2,2,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The extent of economic contraction and subsequent labour market adjustment has been by no means identical within these countries. The national-specific policy responses on a fall in employment and a jump in unemployment in the Visagrad group are the topic of the paper. After the detail description of applied counter-cyclical labour market policies, the analysis of the efficiency of applied policy measures follows. The efficiency is evaluated with respect to (1) the power to create a structural break in underlying trend of employment and unemployment and (2) the right timing. The applied Unit Root Test, test of recursive residuals and Quandt-Andrews Breakpoint Test do not come up with unambiguous results. While the counter-cyclical labour market policy measures do not prove to be efficient in Hungary and Slovakia, the results for the Czech Republic are ambiguous.

The rate of economic growth is declining, unemployment is increasing, as well as the external and internal imbalances; high indebtedness and macroeconomic instability are becoming more prominent limiting factors of improving the business environment. The global economic crisis has greatly worsened the situation. The concept of market economy, which has been applied for more than two decades, is being applied slowly and difficultly. Market institutions are underdeveloped and the infrastructure development is slow. Therefore, the degree of economic freedom of economic entities is on very low level, with still too much government influence on business trends in the economy. In order to improve the business economy and to exit the current economic crisis, the authorities accessed a change of the old model of doing business. Instead of the consumer model oriented to consumption, which implied spending rather than earning and the difference being covered with new borrowing, the new model of economic growth and development is based on reindustrialization, increase of exports and reduction of public expenditure. This model is pro-investment and export oriented, where the dominance of consumption growth is replaced with the domination of investment growth.","[Nikolic, Radmilo; Fedajev, Aleksandra; Riznic, Dejan] Univ Belgrade, Tech Fac Bor, Bor 19210, Serbia",University of Belgrade,,rnikolic@tf.bor.ac.rs; afedajev@tf.bor.ac.rs; driznic@tf.bor.ac.rs,"Fedajev, Aleksandra/K-5198-2019","Fedajev, Aleksandra/0000-0002-6974-6631",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,858,872,,,,,,15,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500080,0

Design/methodology/approach - The study employs semi-structured interviews with senior-level managers, including CSR, production and environmental managers, as well as site observations at leading food processing companies in Thailand. Findings - The study identifies three primary factors: value in economic growth, management vision, and social pressure. The presence of these factors will contribute to the implementation of eco-budgeting. Research limitations/implications - The study limits itself to Thailand, and therefore findings may not be applicable in other settings. To improve the generalization of the findings, future research should broaden the sample. It would also be beneficial to pursue comparative research between industries and countries. Practical implications - Economic incentives are the driving force behind the application of eco-budgeting and the improvement of environmental performance in the long run. In addition, implementation of eco-budgeting would require an increase in the green vision and values throughout the organization. Originality/value - The study defines the foundations for developing environmental sustainability and outlines an incentive scheme to reduce barriers to the implementation of eco-budgeting in food processing companies.","Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Setthasakko, W (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand.",watchaneeporn.tbs@gmail.com,,,"Business Research Center, Thammasat Business School, Thanunasat University, Bangkok, Thailand","Business Research Center, Thammasat Business School, Thanunasat University, Bangkok, Thailand","The research was financially supported by Business Research Center, Thammasat Business School, Thanunasat University, Bangkok, Thailand.",,50,4,4,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Whereas standard economic models predict that farmers will participate in conservation programs so long as they are profitable, empirical findings from behavioral economics point to a number of normally unobservable preferences that may influence the decision-making process. This study tests, for the first time, whether heterogeneity in behavioral preferences correlates with decisions to participate in Payments for Environmental Services (PES) programs. We elicit individual trust and time preferences using economic experiments and link resulting measures to household survey data and participation decisions in a Ugandan PES program. We find that farmers who exhibit a preference for proximate gains - present-biased preferences - are 47.7% more likely to participate in the program than those who show time-consistent or future-biased preferences. This result has implications for ongoing and planned PES programs involving farmers, particularly in Africa, by highlighting a potential relationship between payment timing and participation, and further validates the use of behavioral experiments in explaining real-world decisions.

In Europe, the policy debate over GMOs has been met with a persistent attempt to retreat into sound science as a potential unifying force. However, environmental risk assessment as an aid to regulatory decision-making is inherently entangled with questions of environmental ethics. This is particularly manifested in the setting of environmental protection goals. For the risk assessment of GMOs, the European Food Safety Authority has presented an inconsistent position on environmental protection goals. There is, however, an emerging trend for biodiversity conservation to be enfolded within an ecosystem services frame, and for ecosystem services to be reduced to biological terms. How environmental protection goals are understood, articulated and used to define risk assessment and shape regulatory decision-making is a significant factor in the entrenched debate over the regulation of GMOs in Europe. In negotiating this territory, I suggest that the attempt to enforce a strict divide between nature and culture or social and ecological systems in Europe's risk assessment of GMOs is emphatically counter-productive, for both robust science and considered ethical action.

These charitable agencies in turn distribute food to individuals at risk of hunger. Food banks receive donated food from national and local sources, such as The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and supermarkets. Local sources with frequent high-volume donations justify the use of food bank vehicles for collection. Food bank vehicles are also used to deliver food to rural charitable agencies that are located beyond a distance safe for perishable food to travel without spoilage. Due to limited funds, food banks can only afford to sparingly use their capital on non-food items. This requires exploring more cost effective food delivery and collection strategies. The goal of this paper is to develop transportation schedules that enable the food bank to both (i) collect food donations from local sources and (ii) to deliver food to charitable agencies. We identify satellite locations, called food delivery points (FDPs), where agencies can receive food deliveries. A set covering model is developed to determine the assignment of agencies to an FDP. Both vehicle capacity and food spoilage constraints are considered during assignment. Using the optimal assignment of agencies to FDPs, we identify a weekly transportation schedule that addresses collection and distribution of donated food and incorporates constraints related to food safety, operator workday, collection frequency, and fleet capacity.

Taking as its starting point the trajectories of the enterprises that have shaped the auto industry in Spain, this study explores the sector's process of development within the interpretative framework proposed by Alfred D.

According to these approaches, we must therefore remedy the historical error of dissociating the fields of economics from the natural sciences, notably by restoring the links between these two disciplines. Distinguishing themselves from the two historic approaches, environmental economics and early ecological economics, the emerging institutionalist schools evoke not only the constructed nature of the environmental crisis (generally viewed as an objective fact by both traditional environmental economists and ecological economists), but also the socially constructed nature of the economy and its institutions. An actionalist regulationist approach allows us to formalize this twofold construction and lays the groundwork for a new economic sociology of the environment in which the technical modalities of ecological modernization are studied in light of social relations, with the understanding that social relations are also affected by the materiality of the environmental crisis. This actionalist regulationist approach also lends itself to anticipating likely trajectories in the future ecological modernization of economic institutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon leakage risk is established based on the carbon intensity and trade exposure of each 4-digit industry. Using a novel measure of carbon leakage risk obtained in interviews with almost 400 managers at regulated firms in six countries, we show that carbon intensity is strongly correlated with leakage risk whereas overall trade exposure is not. In spite of this, most exemptions from auctioning are granted to industries with high trade exposure to developed and less developed countries. Our analysis suggests two ways of tightening the exemption criteria without increasing relocation risk among non-exempt industries. The first one is to exempt trade exposed industries only if they are also carbon intensive. The second one is to consider exposure to trade only with less developed countries. By modifying the carbon leakage criteria along these lines, European governments could raise additional revenue from permit auctions of up to (sic)3 billion per year, based on a permit price of (sic)30.

Using new data on inheritances, we extend estimates of mortality back to the mid-thirteenth century and find, by contrast, that deaths from unfree tenants to the nobility were strongly affected by living standards. Looking at a large sample of parishes after 1540, we find that the positive check had weakened considerably by 1650 even though living standards were static at best, but persisted in London for another century despite its higher wages. In both cases the disappearance of the positive check coincided with the introduction of systematic poor relief, suggesting that government action may have played a role in breaking the link between harvest failure and mass mortality.","[Kelly, Morgan; Grada, Cormac O.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Kelly, M (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,71,27,28,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

High-breakdown point regression methods can detect regression outliers, leverage points and influential observations as well. The broadcast internet access of hoseholds (BIAH) is one of the indicators of the information society. Its value depends on the level of economic development, education, employment rate and other relevant factors. The Internet penetration rate as well as the above mentioned criteria vary greatly in the European countries and, consequently, the occurrence of outlying observations can be anticipated in the corresponding analysis. Improper use of the classical least square (LS) regression models with significant variables without accompanying identification of outliers and the assessment of residual normality can lead to the acceptance of an incorrect LS model.

The final objective is to provide useful insights for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) interested in online selling of EVO. Design/methodology/approach - A hedonic price model was estimated considering the following attributes: packaging, cultivar composition, organic certification, oil extraction method, origin certification and localization of selling firms. A survey was performed in 2012 considering 169 virtual stores of SMEs (farms, mills and bottlers) located in all the main Italian olive-growing areas. A data set of 667 references was used to estimate the implicit prices of considered attributes. Findings - The EVOs sold through virtual stores are highly differentiated on the basis of several quality attributes among which the most important is the certification of origin (protected denominations of origin/protected geographical indication). Therefore the firm location could generate considerable advantages or disadvantages in adopting a B2C EC strategy. Research limitations/implications - Future researches should develop a comparison between the premium prices and costs associated to each attribute in order to find the best product differentiation strategy. An accurate analysis about the implementation and management costs of EC systems as well as an examination of interactions between online and offline sale channels is needed. It would be useful to compare the manufacturer direct sell business model with other business model. Originality/value - Few studies applied the hedonic price model to analyse the retail olive oil market. Nevertheless, no studies have analysed the market of EVO sold in virtual shops.","[Carlucci, Domenico; De Gennaro, Bernardo; Roselli, Luigi; Seccia, Antonio] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Roselli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Bari, Italy.",luigi.roselli@uniba.it,"De Gennaro, Bernardo/J-3627-2013; Roselli, Luigi/A-7933-2012; Seccia, Antonio/AAK-2900-2020","De Gennaro, Bernardo/0000-0002-5273-8846; Roselli, Luigi/0000-0002-1164-8772; Carlucci, Domenico/0000-0003-4330-0954; Seccia, Antonio/0000-0003-4549-6479",,,,,55,30,35,0,55,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Any change in policy interest rate leads first to a change in interest rates on the interbank and latter to change in interest rates of bank credits. The result is a contraction of credit driven aggregate demand and ultimately a weakening of inflation pressures. From the point of view indicated above, this study aims to analyze the effect of interest rate policy on total economic activity within the framework of inflation targeting in Turkey after 2001. In line with this goal, the study investigates the degree and speed of interest rate pass-through from policy rates to retail banking rates by adopting a single equation Error Correction Model for the monthly data over the period from January 2002 to December 2013 in Turkey. By indicating that policy rate has a considerable impact on retail banking rates, empirical findings show that central bank of Turkey has a suitable monetary transmission mechanism in order to use policy interest rate to control credit driven demand and eventually prices in the framework of inflation targeting regime.","Balikesir Univ, Bandirma IIBF, Balikesir, Turkey",Balikesir University,"Karahan, Ö (通讯作者)，Balikesir Univ, Bandirma IIBF, Balikesir, Turkey.",okarahan@balikesir.edu.tr,"Karahan, Özcan/D-9357-2018",,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,608,618,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700060,0

Findings - The results showed that 65 per cent of all respondents never checked food labels for additives. Overall, the respondents had poor knowledge on food additives. A significant relationship was established between level of education and knowledge rating based on percentage correct answers to food additive questions (p <0.05). The mean percentage correct answers for consumers with different educational levels increased in the following order: primary education; secondary education; tertiary education (p < 0.05). The responses relating to attitudinal statements reflected indecision and certain misconceptions. In-depth interviews with local food manufacturers revealed positive attitudes and practices towards food additives.

Usage of the lowest price criterion in public procurement has some advantages, but can deliver also problems if it is not used properly, as our two case studies proved. If the focus of procurement is on the process, on compliance with the rules rather than on the actual results, it is difficult to expect positive selections, especially for service and works.

They have a higher level of social activity, but also are more likely to have part-time jobs while studying at university. Volunteers more often have experience in their profession and they are more often going to work in the specialty after graduation.

In current research, a co-current spray dryer (tall-form) was modeled by the CFD method, and the flow-pattern in cooling the air jacket and the temperature variation were estimated. The dryer chamber was surrounded by a cooling air jacket and the chamber wall jacket was cooled by a 1400 m(3)/h blower which provided ambient air to the jacket from the end of the conical part of the dryer, and extracted the air from the top of the cylindrical part of the dryer. Temperature in the dryer was measured by several transmitters in order to verify the modeling results. Numerical modeling of the heat transfer in a cooling air jacket of a spray dryer was achieved by employing the computational fluid dynamic method. The k-e standard model was considered for turbulence simulation. Velocity magnitude and temperature variation, in the chamber and in the cooling air jacket, were investigated in this modeling. Velocity variation for different heights of the chamber and for temperature were measured by a portable hot-wire anemometer and by some installed transmitters on the dryer wall in order to verify the numerical modeling results. Given the flow path line in the air jacket, the air layer path lines had a harmonic motion relative to each other with minimum axial velocity variation. Air velocity in the axes was also at the maximum. In the conjunction of the cylindrical and conical parts of the dryer jacket, there was a small amount of flow deviation towards the wall. The temperature contour indicated there was intensive temperature reduction around the core flow. The flow in the cooling jacket caused a temperature reduction in the dryer wall, especially in the boundary of the chamber cone part.","[Roustapour, O.

The subject of research covers the structure of workforce in these sectors in NUTS 2 regions of the Visegrad Group member countries in the period 2008-2012. The purpose of the study is to identify the intensity of regional specialization, to classify regions in terms of the values of specialization indices and identification of regions characterized by higher workforce share in high and mid-high technology sector and also knowledge-intensive services comparing to EU 28. Regional specialization indices and multivariate data analysis methods, with particular emphasis on cluster analysis method, were applied in empirical studies. The choice of research problem is justified by the relevance of regional specialization in high-tech economic sectors, referred to as smart growth sectors, as the crucial factor of socio-economic development based on knowledge and innovation.","[Sobczak, Elzbieta; Prudzienica, Maja] Wroclaw Univ Econ, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Sobczak, E (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",elzbieta.sobczak@ue.wroc.pl; maja.prudzienica@ue.wroc.pl,"Prudzienica, Maja/I-3758-2013; Sobczak, Elzbieta/K-3590-2018","Sobczak, Elzbieta/0000-0003-1912-7493",,,,,14,0,0,0,9,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1386,1396,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700135,0

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a sample of 618 urban Indian consumers. The study questionnaire was developed to measure food-related lifestyle and attitudinal variables. The respondents were also questioned regarding their grocery purchase behaviour; awareness and purchase intentions regarding organic food. The data collected were analysed using SPSS 20.0 using factor, cluster and chi(2) analysis to identify and profile the health-conscious segments and profile them based on their organic purchase intentions. Findings - In total, 33 lifestyle variables were reduced to five food-related attitudinal factors. Based on the five factors three potential clusters were identified. The urban Indian consumer was found to be environment, health and safety conscious. Sensitized and cautious segment of young, women living in nuclear families were more open to an organic alternative. The main barriers to successful adoption were premium pricing, doubtful certification and sporadic availability of organic food. Research limitations/implications - The urban Indian is ready to shift to a healthier option. However, the awareness, availability and price need to be managed more aggressively. A larger pan-India study to identify the high-potential belts and the domestic organic distribution and certification practices need to be assessed to formulate a focused marketing strategy. Originality/value - Paucity of literature exists about the potential organic consumers. Such studies are extremely meaningful for an organic marketer to design effective communication and distribution strategies in order to accelerate the adoption and preference for an organic purchase.","Int Management Inst, Dept Mkt, New Delhi, India",International Management Institute (IMI) New Delhi,"Sondhi, N (通讯作者)，Int Management Inst, Dept Mkt, New Delhi, India.",neenasondhi@imi.edu,,,,,,,59,18,18,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Understanding determinants and magnitudes of individuals' preferences for AD prevention programs is important while estimating the benefits of any new pharmacological intervention that targets the prevention of the disease. This paper applied contingent valuation, a method frequently used for economic valuation of goods or services not transacted in the markets, to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) to prevent AD based on the nationally representative Health and Retirement Survey data. The WTP was associated in predictable ways with respondent characteristics. The mean estimated WTP for preventing AD is $155 per month (95 % CI $153-$157) based on interval regression. On average, a higher WTP for the prescription drug for AD prevention was reported by respondents with higher perceived risks, and greater household wealth. The findings provide useful information about determinants and the magnitude of individuals' preferences for AD prevention drugs for healthcare payers and individual families while making decisions to prevent AD.","Texas A&M Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med,Scott & White Healthcare, Temple, TX 76508 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M Health Science Center,"Basu, R (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med,Scott & White Healthcare, 2401 South 31st St,5th Floor, Temple, TX 76508 USA.",rbasu@sw.org,,"Basu, Rashmita/0000-0003-1559-270X",,,,,48,22,23,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Using stochastic frontier analysis we find that the efficiency scores for congestion and the associated ranking of cities is sensitive to the measure of congestion. In contrast, the efficiency scores and rankings are robust for the two measures of the monetary value of congestion. Most importantly, for the most valid measure of congestion and both measures of the monetary value of congestion, we find that average TFP growth over the study period is characterized by an upward trend. This is an encouraging sign even though in all three cases growth is only zero or slightly less than zero at the end of the study period. We therefore conclude that policies which have been used towards the end of the study period such as providing incentives to carpool and encouraging employers to offer flexi-time and telecommuting arrangements appear to have been effective and should be implemented more widely.","[Glass, Anthony J.; Kenjegalieva, Karligash] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Sickles, Robin C.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA",Loughborough University; Rice University,"Sickles, RC (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",A.J.Glass@lboro.ac.uk; K.A.Kenjegalieva@lboro.ac.uk; rsickles@rice.edu,"Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023","Glass, Anthony/0000-0002-5984-7666; Glass, Karligash/0000-0001-7323-077X",,,,,35,3,4,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

(J Prod Anal 21:91-103, 2004), this study proposes to compare and measure the cost efficiency and cost frontier gap between the banking industry in Taiwan and China. It further identifies environmental variables that determine bank's cost frontier gap between two countries. Data on 69 sample banks for years 2005-2009 are used in the empirical analysis and inference. The empirical results show that Taiwanese banks have in general the superior cost frontier of production, but inferior cost efficiency of operation than Chinese banks. Private banks in Taiwan have the best cost frontier, whereas foreign banks in China are most cost efficient among all banks in Taiwan and China. The empirical results also reveal that the majority of Taiwanese banks are undersized and that most banks in China are oversized. Finally, the regression results show that the financial market structure, institutional environment, and political development are significant determinants of the cost gap between the cost frontiers of banks in Taiwan and China. Therefore, programs related to changes directed toward a better bank production environment can be initiated to improve the cost technologies of banks in both Taiwan and China.","[Huang, Mei-Ying] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Fu, Tsu-Tan] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University; Soochow University,"Fu, TT (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",mayin@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; tfu@scu.edu.tw,,,,,,,34,30,32,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In this paper, we seek to better understand preferences for different combinations of assets that comprise (part of) the asset portfolio of a nation. In a study of coastal and marine natural assets, we test for the existence of weak or strong sustainability preferences using different compensation options (respectively produced capital and natural capital) offered to a sample of the public in Spain in the case of possible future oil spills. As a further element of this test, we provide an empirical reflection on Aldred (2002, 2006) and Turner (2007) who speculate that individuals may not view money as compensating for certain environmental losses whereas investments in social assets may offer a more acceptable compensation option. Our results do appear to circumscribe in some way the acceptability of investing in produced capital and reveal a tendency towards a preference for social capital compensation. Nevertheless, the size of the oil spill and the environmental beliefs of respondents also influence choices over the natural capital compensation option. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The underlying study overcomes this problem through the use of historical data on 164 prominent classical composers born after 1800. I analyze the impact of war on the probability to emigrate of composers, investigate the associated dynamics and shed light on the choice of a destination country in times of war. I find that the incidence of inter-state wars increases composers' probability to emigrate by around 7 % and the incidence of intra-state wars by roughly 19 %. The results imply that conflict impacts the migration intensity with a lag of approximately 1 year. Furthermore, the choice of a destination country is significantly affected by the incidence of war and less efficient from a career's point of view during war. Finally, I find heterogeneous responses to war based on individual's quality. While the better composers are more likely to emigrate in times of peace, it is not so anymore if a war breaks out. In times of war, all artists are affected by war and are prone to emigrate.","[Borowiecki, Karol Jan] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Borowiecki, Karol Jan] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",University of Southern Denmark; Trinity College Dublin,"Borowiecki, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark.",kjb@sam.sdu.dk,"Borowiecki, Karol J./ABE-1387-2021","Borowiecki, Karol J./0000-0003-4959-181X",,,,,40,4,4,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2013,7.0,3,,,,,237,266,,10.1007/s11698-012-0087-6,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,203QX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323308900002,0

Phase 1, effective from 1995 to 1999, requires electric utilities to reduce their emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide (bad outputs). Actions undertaken to reduce the emissions (using less sulfur content coal, installing equipment), may have led to higher production costs, and impacted the rate of TFP growth. Rate regulation may impact how the firm produces its selected output level, which could lead to higher cost over time, and biased estimates of TFP growth. Following the work of Ball et al. (Struct Change Econ Dyn 16(3): 374-394, 2005), who developed the standard Malmquist cost productivity (MCP) index, we develop a MCP index for a rate regulated firm (RMCP index) then use the standard and regulated indices to determine whether having to comply with Phase 1 impacted TFP growth. Empirical results indicate that (i) the RMCP index underestimated the rate at which TFP growth occurred, (ii) Phase 1 utilities on average experienced positive TFP growth from 1996 to 2000 (Phase 1 firms experienced higher TFP growth rates than the rates experienced by firms not subject to Phase 1), and operated more allocatively inefficient in complying with the Phase 1 restrictions. Complying with Phase 1 did not affect the rate at which technical change occurred or the rates of change in scale efficiency.","[Granderson, Gerald] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Prior, Diego] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University System of Ohio; Miami University; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Granderson, G (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",grandegd@muohio.edu; diego.prior@uab.cat,,"Prior, Diego/0000-0002-4669-2861",,,,,52,14,16,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Yet the UNFCCC's goal is defined as a stock (atmospheric GHG concentration). Flow inventories are apt for the fossil fuel sector where flows are effectively one way, stock changes are almost entirely anthropogenic, and stocks are stable in the absence of human perturbation. For the land sector, flow-based GHG inventories obscure fundamental differences between ecosystems: in their carbon stock stability, restoration capacity, and density. This paper presents a national carbon accounting framework that is comprehensive and includes stocks as well as flows for reservoirs, lands and activities continuously over time. It complements current flow-based inventories under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. The framework differentiates reservoirs by their role in the global carbon cycle, distinguishing between geocarbon (carbon in the geosphere), biocarbon (carbon in the biosphere) and anthropogenic carbon (stockpiles, products and waste). A reservoir ranking system is proposed based on longevity, reversibility of carbon loss, and carbon density. This framework will support policy makers and researchers grappling with mitigation strategies and competing demands on agricultural land and natural ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While the response is in the negative at the global level, as demonstrated by the adoption in 2010 of the Nagoya Protocol, the provider-user distinction, if portrayed exclusively as a North-South relation, is no longer adequate to fully apprehend the political and legal dynamics at work in access and benefit sharing (ABS) regimes. Evolving configurations of this distinction can be found in a country that formerly saw itself solely as a provider (Brazil) and in a country that initially considered itself as both a user and a provider (France). In both cases, non-State actors (even if from the public sector) are reinterpreting the categories of the CBD for their own ends and are seeking to gain prerogatives related to the governance of genetic resources. That said, the trajectories of Brazil and French Guiana are quite different. While Brazil appears to be leaving behind an indiscriminate fight against biopiracy and entering a process of valorization of resources (led by the national scientific community), Guiana is shifting toward a locally governed regime that seeks to control as much as possible but which is difficult to put in place, even if arrangements have commenced on the fringes of official negotiations. Finally, the article shows that the content of ABS regimes is specified by the outcomes of local dynamics of biodiplomacy as much as by the stereotypical hypotheses discussed at a global level.","[Filoche, Geoffroy] IRD, UMR GRED, Montpellier, France; [Filoche, Geoffroy] Univ Fed Goias, IESA, BR-74691300 Goiania, Go, Brazil",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universidade Federal de Goias,"Filoche, G (通讯作者)，IRD, UMR GRED, Montpellier, France.",geoffroy.filoche@ird.fr,,,,,,,55,4,4,1,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

To gain insight into our model, we develop a series of theoretical properties. To test the applicability of our model a series of computational tests are performed. From such tests we conclude that it is possible to solve relatively large instances of the problem utilizing standard optimization software.

Each of those governance tasks constitutes a potential niche that a regime can specialize in within a larger institutional complex. Applying this niche-oriented approach to the case of Arctic marine transport helps to explain the emerging division of labor between regional and global institutions in an issue area marked by rapid change. Drawing on earlier regime-effectiveness research, the article examines the potential of regional institutions, especially the Arctic Council, to contribute to strengthening the international governance system for shipping, based on the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO). Although the Arctic Council is not well positioned to regulate regional shipping activities, it may facilitate regulatory advances in the IMO, in part by knowledge-building and in part by helping Arctic states to find common ground on matters of controversy. The Council is also well equipped to enhance regional maritime infrastructure, like capacities for responding to oil spills, and search and rescue operations. Should binding region-specific international rules on Arctic shipping be adopted, Arctic institutions could play a role in coordinating port-state enforcement measures-but existing institutions with broader participation are better suited and will probably remain dominant. The larger question of achieving cross-institutional interplay that can promote effectiveness is relevant in any region or issue area, because efforts to solve specific problems usually involve more than one institution.","Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, N-1366 Lysaker, Norway",,"Stokke, OS (通讯作者)，Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, PB 326, N-1366 Lysaker, Norway.",olav.s.stokke@fni.no,,,,,,,75,38,44,0,76,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The first one (1270s-1590s) corresponds to a high land-labour ratio frontier economy, which is pastoral, trade-oriented, and led by towns. Wages and food consumption were relatively high. Sustained per capita growth occurred from the end of the Reconquest (1264) to the Black Death (1340s) and resumed from the 1390s only broken by late fifteenth-century turmoil. A second regime (1600s-1810s) corresponds to a more agricultural and densely populated low-wage economy which, although it grew at a pace similar to that of 1270-1600, remained at a lower level. Contrary to preindustrial western Europe, Spain achieved its highest living standards in the 1340s, not by mid-fifteenth century. Although its death toll was lower, the plague had a more damaging impact on Spain and, far from releasing non-existent demographic pressure, destroyed the equilibrium between scarce population and abundant resources. Pre-1350 per capita income was reached by the late sixteenth century but only exceeded after 1820.","[Alvarez-Nogal, Carlos; Prados De La Escosura, Leandro] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Alvarez-Nogal, C (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,"Nogal, Carlos Alvarez/AAS-5873-2020; de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/H-9476-2015","Nogal, Carlos Alvarez/0000-0002-0175-597X; de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/0000-0002-2362-4305",,,,,147,133,138,3,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Rather than stressing bottom-up forces of mobilization linked to poor harvests and rural unemployment or the inability of the state to enforce reformist legislation, this article explores the role of state policy in sorting out the acute coordination and collective action problems of mobilizing rural labourers. This is done by looking at the effects of intervention on rural labour markets in dry-farming areas of Spain (parts of Castile and of Andalusia). Given the difficulties of constructing a conclusive test of the hypothesis, three indirect testing strategies are used. The first is an examination of the qualitative evidence on the functioning of labour markets in dry-farming areas of Spain. Second, because the argument presented in this article implies the existence of severe restrictions on the labour supply of rural labourers during the harvest in the early 1930s, harvest-to-winter wage ratios before and after the passing of legislation are studied. Finally, the diffusion of union offices and general strikes in several dry-farming provinces of Spain is examined, in order to show that alternative hypotheses to explain rural conflict are not consistent with the historical record.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Domenech, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,"Domenech, Jordi/L-1581-2014","Domenech, Jordi/0000-0001-7937-9444",,,,,56,16,16,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The economic determinants of national and international migrations and the impact of immigrants on labor markets have been investigated by economists, geographers, and regional scientists for a long time. Recently, however, the availability of new and detailed individual data on migrants across regions and localities in several countries has made it possible to analyze the impact of immigration on a richer set of socio-economic outcomes. Two avenues of research have emerged as particularly interesting and are the focus of this special issue. First, international migrants are particularly concentrated in urban areas but their impact on some outcomes that are particularly relevant in cities (such as crime and housing markets) are not well understood yet. Second, immigrants not only increase labor supply but also affect firms' productivity, survival and growth through their impact on localized externalities. These two themes link all the contributions of this special issue and show new directions for future research on the impact of immigration.","[Ottaviano, Gianmarco] Bocconi Univ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ottaviano, Gianmarco] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Peri, Giovanni] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ottaviano, G (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.i.ottaviano@lse.ac.uk; gperi@ucdavis.edu,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,32,14,14,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

We apply the model developed in part one to simulate the indirect rebound, given an estimate of the direct rebound, using a 2002 environmentally-extended input-output model and the 2004 Consumer Expenditure Survey (in 2002$) for the U.S. We find an indirect rebound of 5-15% in primary energy and CO(2)e emissions, assuming a 10% direct rebound, depending on the fuel saved with efficiency and household income. The indirect rebound can be as high as 30-40% in NOx or SO2 emissions for efficiency in natural gas services. The substitution effect modeled in part one is small in most cases, and we discuss appropriate applications for proportional or income elasticity spending assumptions. Large indirect rebound effects occur as the U.S. electric grid becomes less-carbon intensive, in households with large transportation demands, or as energy prices increase. Even in extreme cases, there is limited evidence for backfire, or a rebound effect greater than 100%. Enacting pollution taxes or auctioned permits that internalize the externalities of energy use would ensure that rebound effects unambiguously increase consumers' welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Risk management in sixteenth-century Dutch households",ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENGLISH AGRICULTURE; MEDIEVAL; INTERVENTION; MARKETS; STORAGE,"In the past one of the main challenges to households was that of coping with adversity. War, plague, famine, and flood were a constant threat, and could reduce what little improvements families had made in productivity. Economic growth therefore required a means of absorbing external adversities. To see how well late medieval households coped with adversity, this investigation focuses on the households of a small town and its surroundings in early modern Holland. Our findings reveal that several severe external shocks around 1500 had little effect on the general level or distribution of wealth, which suggests that certain forms of insurance may have protected the population. The results show that households increasingly invested in capital markets rather than employing such techniques as scattered holdings and hoarding. This fact indicates that such investment played a vital role in a household's risk aversion strategy. The change from unproductive to more productive risk-aversion strategies also provides some clues about progress with respect to insurance during Holland's financial revolution.","[Zuijderduijn, Jaco; De Moor, Tine] Univ Utrecht, Res Inst Hist & Culture, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Zuijderduijn, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Res Inst Hist & Culture, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Zuijderduijn, Jaco/HPD-8142-2023","Zuijderduijn, Jaco/0000-0002-1296-008X; De Moor, Tine/0000-0002-9462-6404",,,,,62,13,14,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Specifically, it provides: (a) a theoretical and empirical review of the conditions under which performance standards can provide efficient incentives for deep emission reductions and technology adoption; and (b) an analysis of the design and the outcomes of the standards-based regulation of industrial pollutants in Sweden during the period 1970-1990. Our empirical findings suggest that the Swedish regulatory approach comprised many key elements of an efficient policy-induced transition towards radically lower emissions in the metal smelting and pulp and paper industries. The regulation relied solely on performance standards, thus granting flexibility to firms in terms of selecting the appropriate compliance measures. These standards were implemented in combination with extended compliance periods. R&D projects and the new knowledge that was advanced incrementally in interaction between the company, the environmental authorities and research institutions provided a direct catalyst to the regulatory process. In these ways the Swedish regulatory approach provided scope for creative solutions, environmental innovation, and permitted the affected companies to coordinate pollution abatement measures with productive investments.

Owing to the industrialization of food processing and biotechnological innovations on the one hand and a series of food scandals on the other, consumers are now more concerned about modern food hazards. The present study aims to investigate whether consumers with varying degrees of modern tainted foods worries and gender difference will show variations in the Health and Taste Attitude Scales (HTAS). Design/methodology/approach - Of a total of 1,500 questionnaires sent out, 533 were found useful for this empirical analysis. The measurement items of the Health and Taste Attitude Scale (HTAS) were scored as the data input to test for the impacts of modern tainted foods worries and gender by ANOVA tests. Findings - The results of this study conducted in Taiwan indicate that those people identified in the high modern tainted foods worries group have more interests in health in foods but the low modern tainted foods worries group have more interests in taste in foods. In addition, though more concerned about health in foods, female consumers are also more interested in sweet foods. Practical implications - Some suggestions for food marketers and food policy makers are also provided in this study. Originality/value - To the best knowledge of this researcher, this study represents one of the first attempts to investigate the health and taste attitudes in Taiwan and tests for the impacts of modern tainted foods worries and gender.","Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan",Tatung University,"Chen, MF (通讯作者)，Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan.",mfchen@ttu.edu.tw,,,,,,,70,17,17,3,46,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Traditionally S&PF has distributed money to states and territories formulaically. Now, under the 2008 Redesign Initiative, 15% of these funds are allocated through a competitive process. In this paper we analyze this initiative through the lens of institutional economics. Using budget, interview and survey data, we evaluate the new allocation process on the criteria of allocative efficiency, transaction costs, and distributional effects. Additionally, we examine a trade-off the Redesign Initiative faces between short-term innovations and funding programs that meet long-term USFS goals. We conclude that, while there is some positive evidence that the program is achieving some of its stated goals, it is doing so at the expense of higher transaction costs and less certain long-term projects. Moreover, we find that the lack of procedures to evaluate competitively funded projects is an important flaw that may prevent the new initiative from helping to create a high performing and adaptive governance system.

However, the image of these products in The Netherlands is still low. The purpose of this paper is to explore consumers' experiences and sensory expectations of meat substitutes and the appropriateness of the use of meat substitutes in meals. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 46 consumers took part in seven focus group discussions. These discussions consisted of three steps, starting with a general discussion on meat substitutes, followed by a discussion on the appropriateness of the use of meat substitutes as ingredients (minced, in pieces or slices) by using photographs of six different dishes (soup, pasta, rice, wrap, meal salad, and pizza). The discussions were concluded with a taste session of two dishes with meat substitutes. Findings - Consumers in this study regarded health aspects and easy preparation as positive aspects of meat substitutes. Lack of information on the package, and high price were reported as negative. Sensory aspects such as neutral taste or tastiness, crispiness, chicken-like texture, or granular texture were seen as positive attributes. Negative sensory aspects that were mentioned were uniform taste, compactness, dryness and softness. Most consumers found the use of meat substitutes appropriate in the dishes we presented. Originality/value - The paper's findings can, together with quantitative consumer and sensory research, be a start towards consumer-oriented product development of environmentally more sustainable meat substitutes. The central role of meal context and appropriateness is an aspect that has not yet received much attention in food science.","[Elzerman, Johanna E.; van Boekel, Martinus A. J.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper reports findings from in-depth interviews with grandparents and parents (n = 33) from ten three-generational families and parents (n = 20) from ten nuclear families with single children between six and nine years old. Findings - Grandparents unequivocally accorded supreme importance to ensuring a child finishes his/her meals while parents tended to hold slightly more liberal views. These differences created higher conflict and tensions between the caregivers in three-generational families as compared to nuclear households. Children in multigenerational families were more frequently force-fed by adult-caregivers whereas their counterparts were more capable of feeding themselves during meal times. Research limitations/implications - This exploratory study provides in-depth insights but carries the limitation of generalisability. Future research can apply similar methodology on bigger samples so as to ascertain a better estimation of the extent of stress and tension across generations over meal times in urban China. Practical implications - The initial finding reported in this paper is useful for public health workers and family life educators in China to help families with children of middle childhood to manage tension arising from meal times. Originality/value - Diverging from most parenting research which tends to focus on parent-child dynamics, this paper included three generations grandparents, parents, grandchildren in the research conceptualization. This is important as grandparents are integral parts of childrearing in China.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Social Work, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Goh, ECL (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Social Work, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",swkegcl@nus.edu.sg,"Goh, Esther C L/K-8511-2012","Goh, Esther C L/0000-0002-0235-2363",National University of Singapore [R-134-000-059-133],National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore),This paper is funded by the National University of Singapore R-134-000-059-133.

Under increasing pressures of globalization and urbanization, a consumer-focused approach to performance improvement in supply chains can lead to more satisfied consumers and improved returns to growers and retailers. This paper aims to demonstrate that such an orientation, though lacking in agri-food supply chains in developing countries, can mitigate threats to food safety, consumer health and environmental quality. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through random survey intercepts (n = 418) at different retail outlets for fresh vegetables in Nairobi, Kenya in 2010. Multi-step cluster analysis (Ward Method, K-means) was used to classify fresh vegetable consumers, in terms of their product, production and marketing process preferences. Findings Four heterogeneous segments in terms of value preferences, behaviour and personal profiles (p < 0.05) were derived. They were labelled Prestigious Shoppers (25 per cent), Market Enthusiasts (18 per cent), Ethics Crusaders (41 per cent) and Safety Sceptics (16 per cent). All segments expressed high or moderate preferences for product quality. In addition, the Prestigious Shoppers expressed a moderate preference for customer service. Market Enthusiasts attached the highest values to market conditions and customer service. Ethics Crusaders most highly preferred customer service, while Safety Sceptics most highly preferred safe production. Research limitations/implications Since it is difficult to predict consumer behaviour precisely, these findings may be contextual. Yet, the segments have unique value preferences despite actors treating them as homogeneous. Ignoring these differences can lead to unsustainable attempts to improve chain practice and policies. Originality/value This paper is the first of its kind. It advocates for use of universal value profiles as a basis for development of consumer-focused strategies for sustainable performance improvement in agri-food chains in developing countries.","[Macharia, John; Collins, Ray; Sun, Tim] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Macharia, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld, Australia.",jmacharia2003@yahoo.com,,,University of Queensland's Graduate School,University of Queensland's Graduate School(University of Queensland),The authors acknowledge The University of Queensland's Graduate School for financing this study.,,51,29,31,3,85,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Sustainable management of the earth's lands requires indicators to monitor these connections across regions and scales. The 'embodied human appropriation of NPP (eHANPP) allows one to consistently attribute the HANPP resulting from production chains to consumers. HANPP is the sum of land-use induced NPP changes and biomass harvest. We present the first national-level assessment of embodied HANPP related to agriculture based on a calculation using bilateral trade matrices. The dataset allows (1) the tracing of the biomass-based products consumed in Austria in the year 2000 to their countries of origin and quantifying the HANPP caused in production, and (2) the assigning of the national-level HANPP on Austria's territory to the consumers of the products on the national level. The dataset is constructed along a consistent system boundary between society and ecosystems and can be used to assess Austria's physical trade balance in terms of eHANPP. Austria's eHANPP-trade balance is slightly negative (imports are larger than exports); import and export flows are large in relation to national HANPP. Our findings show how the eHANPP approach can be used for quantifying and mapping the teleconnections related to a nation's biomass metabolism. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We distinguish expenditures on innovation (R&D) and imitation (international technology spillovers) and consider the role of capital investment in creating and implementing new technologies. Our main contribution is to calibrate and numerically solve the model and to examine the model's sensitivity. As an application, we assess a carbon budget-based climate policy and vary the beginning of energy-saving technology transfer. Accordingly, China is a main beneficiary of early technology transfer. Herein, our results highlight the importance of timely international technology transfer for efficiently meeting global emission targets. Most of the consumption gains from endogenous growth are captured in the baseline. Moreover, mitigation costs turn out to be insensitive to changes in most of the parameters of endogenous growth. A higher effectivity of energy-specific relative to labor-specific expenditures on innovation and imitation reduces mitigation costs, though. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

If left implicit, such considerations may be represented poorly in planning. To foster explicit inclusion of intangible values alongside material values connected to ecosystems, we elicited verbal articulation, spatial identification and quantified marine-related values and threats across the seascape of northem Vancouver Island, Canada. We address: (1) how do our spatial interviews-involving maps and semi-structured interviews-enable and/or impede the elicitation of intangible values? (2) What categories of ecosystem benefits do participants identify as most important? (3) Are spatial distributions of monetary values correlated with non-monetary values and threats? Our findings indicate that (1) while maps were provocative, sizable minorities of interviewees refused to assign different numerical non-monetary values to specific locations (30%), or refused to identify locations of non-monetary importance (16%); (2) people allocated the highest non-monetary values to places notable for wildlife, outdoor recreation, then cultural heritage; and (3) significant pair-wise overlap occurred, but also sizable deviations, among monetary, non-monetary and threat distributions. Despite limitations to representing non-monetary values spatially and quantitatively, these methods offer a straightforward approach to catalog and map ecosystem services to inform spatial planning.

The underlying model used for the data analysis is based on the wage equation, which is one of a handful of simultaneous equations which when satisfied correspond to the short-run equilibrium of New Economic Geography (NEG) theory. This is estimated using various spatial panel models with either fixed or random effects to allow for individual heterogeneity. Using these models, we find consistent evidence that productivity depends directly on the public capital stock endowment of each province, but also there is evidence of negative spillover effects from changes in capital stock in neighboring provinces.","[Gomez-Antonio, Miguel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Fiscal Syst, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Fingleton, Bernard] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",Complutense University of Madrid; University of Strathclyde,"Gómez-Antonio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Fiscal Syst, Campus Somosaguas S-N, Madrid 28223, Spain.",mga@ccee.ucm.es,"Fingleton, Bernard/GZA-5738-2022; Gomez de Antonio, Miguel/Q-5859-2018","Fingleton, Bernard/0000-0001-7359-643X; Gomez de Antonio, Miguel/0000-0002-7138-0587","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1, ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G005966/1, ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,75,4,4,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Quantification and valuation of services can enhance policies and regulations and, if linked with payments or incentives, properly reward private decisions that yield public benefits. However, the field of ecosystem services research is relatively new and quantification and valuation remains highly uncertain. While there is significant uncertainty about the biophysical production of ecosystem services, there is additional uncertainty about the value of services. This paper explores how uncertainty associated with valuation of ecosystem services in agriculture affects the ranking of land use alternatives in terms of social net benefits. We compare the values of four land use scenarios in the Minnesota River Basin, USA, by combining a range of value estimates for these services with varying estimates for returns from agricultural production. Although variations in ecosystem service values are significant, fluctuations in agricultural returns more significantly determine how scenarios rank with regard to delivery of total value. This analysis suggests that addressing uncertainty in ecosystem service valuation is critical to accurately assessing tradeoffs in land use. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.

A unified approach among disciplines involved in researching and implementing ecosystem services is imperative to moving concepts into practice. An operational definition needs to be adopted by the ecosystem service community as the basis of a classification system so that ecosystem goods and services may be measured by ecologists, valued by economists, and utilized by decision-makers. We propose a transdisciplinary approach centered upon shared principles, an ecosystem services definition, and a classification system. This shared foundation provides a common set of ecosystem goods and services that serves as the focus for and connection among multiple disciplines. This foundation is specific enough to be operational while remaining relevant to a multitude of ecosystem service objectives for which frameworks and implementation plans may be developed. Although numerous ecosystem service frameworks exist in the literature, many of them are non-operational or are focused toward a single discipline. An evaluation of these frameworks identifies knowledge gaps and suggests how we may advance ecosystem services into practice. Our evaluation demonstrates that foundational concepts (especially a definition and classification system, and community involvement) are often poorly addressed in ecosystem service frameworks.

While institutional arrangements for interfacing scientific and policy-making processes are emerging as key elements in the structure of international environmental governance, formal understanding regarding their effectiveness is still limited. In an effort to advance that understanding, we propose that science-policy interfaces can be understood as institutions and that implementation failures in international environmental governance may be attributed, in part, to institutional mismatches (sic. Young in Institutions and environmental change: Principal findings, applications, and research, MIT Press, Cambridge 2008) associated with poor design of these institutions. In order to investigate this proposition, we employ three analytical categories-credibility, relevance and legitimacy, drawn from Cash et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 100(14):8086-8091, (2003), to explore basic characteristics of the institutions proscribed under two approaches to institutional design, which we term linear and collaborative. We then proceed to take a closer look at institutional mismatches that may arise with the operationalisation of the soon to be established Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). We find that, while there are encouraging signs that institutions based on new agreements, such as the IPBES, have the potential to overcome many of the institutional mismatches we have identified, there remain substantial tensions between continuing reliance on the established linear approach and an emerging collaborative approach, which can be expected to continue undermining the credibility, relevance and legitimacy of these institutions, at least in the near future.","[Koetz, Thomas; Farrell, Katharine N.] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Bridgewater, Peter] UK Joint Nat Conservat Comm, Peterborough PE1 1JY, Cambs, England",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Koetz, T (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Edifici C,Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",koetz.thomas@gmail.com,"Bridgewater, Peter/AAA-2810-2020; Zhang, Rachel/B-6591-2012",,,,,,75,82,86,1,75,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We find that employees have significant heterogeneity in both adoption costs and network benefits, and have preferences for diverse networks.

Moreover, population growth between 1980 and 2000 has not been significantly different in low- and high-utility cities, suggesting that other forces are at work shaping the sorting processes that match workers and firms.

The paper starts off by explaining the concept of social innovations in communities. Processes by which ideas and influence spread through a social network have been studied in a number of fields. The emphasis was placed on the diffusion of technological innovations and new products. The current widespread adoption of various strategies and the effects of word of mouth in promotion of new goods and services rely on social networks. The use and potential abuse of information technology in some fields of our everyday life is also observed.

It seeks to develop and discuss two models for perceived quality of tomato, including the price variable as an indicator for perceived quality of tomato. Design/methodology/approach - The data come from a survey of 400 consumers that measures the importance of a set of tomato attributes on a Likert scale. The models were adjusted by means of structural equation analysis. Two procedures were followed for model development the first started from an exploratory factor analysis. In the second, relations and correlations among variables were established starting from the theoretical framework that differentiates among search, experience and credence attributes. Findings - Two models of tomato perceived quality are formulated and discussed. Both established that the perceived quality of fresh tomato could be explained through nine attributes. Some of them can be deduced at the place of purchase; some, during consumption while others are a question of trust. With regard to using price as an indicator of the perceived quality of tomato, both models suggested the elimination of this variable from the model for perceived quality. Originality/value - Studying perceived quality has received much attention in research on the behaviour of food consumers. Nevertheless, there are not many attempts to establish models for the perceived quality of fresh fruit and vegetables. Specifically, there are very few studies on consumer behaviour that analyse the perceived quality of tomato. Thus, this study is one of the first attempts to establish a model for perceived quality of tomato.","[Martinez-Carrasco, L.; Brugarolas, M.; Martinez-Poveda, A.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Agroenvironm Econ Dept, Polytech High Sch Orihuela, Orihuela, Spain; [Ruiz, J.

Based on a survey of Scottish dairy farmers, this study investigates farmers' perceptions of how different GHG mitigation practices affect the economic and environmental performance of their farms, and the degree to which those farmers have adopted those practices. The results of the farm survey data are used to identify promising mitigation practices for immediate policy support based on their potential for additional adoption by farmers, their perceived contribution to the farm's financial and environmental performance and information on their cost-effectiveness. The study demonstrates the usefulness of including adoption behaviour and farmers' perception of mitigation practices to inform early stages of policy development. This would ultimately contribute to the robustness and effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies in the agricultural sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The cases of Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana are explored to show the uneven coverage of census taking in colonial and post-colonial Africa and to demonstrate the need for an upward adjustment of the conventional 1950 benchmark.

However, mainstream certification schemes in the agricultural sector have been adopted primarily by larger and more established producers, indicating an unequal distribution of social benefits. Group certification is often promoted as one alternative to increase accessibility for smaller producers, but there has been a lack of studies assessing this hypothesis. We assessed all coffee producers certified under the Sustainable Agriculture Network-Rainforest Alliance Certified system in Brazil in 2011, comprising 55 individual farms and 11 groups of individual producers. We found that group certification has increased access to small and medium size producers compared to certification for individually certified producers. There is diversity in the way producers are organized and in the profile of producers among and inside groups. However, the small producers participating in group certification are those with high productivity, suggesting that the most marginalized producers are still unable to access the certification system. Thus additional policy interventions will be necessary to promote more sustainable practices among the large numbers of marginalized coffee farmers in Brazil. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

But most studies on the market diffusion of EVs focus on average driving patters and neglect the great variations in daily driving of individuals present in real-world driving data. Yet these variations are important for EVs since range limitations and the electric driving share of plug-in hybrids strongly impact the economic evaluation and consumer acceptance of EVs. Additionally, studies often focus on private cars only and neglect that commercial buyers account for relevant market shares in vehicle sales. Here, we propose a detailed, user specific model for the market diffusion of EVs and evaluation of EV market diffusion policies based on real-world driving data. The data and model proposed include both private and commercial users in Germany and allow the calculation of realistic electric driving shares for all usage patterns. The proposed model explicitly includes user heterogeneity in driving behaviour, different user groups, psychological aspects and the effect of charge-at-home options. Our results show that the proposed model reproduces group specific market shares, gives confidence bands of market shares and simulates individual electric driving shares. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In order to reach consumers 'beyond the eco-niche', identifying the drivers that positively influence the adoption of green electricity is of fundamental importance. This paper examines various factors that help to explain the extent to which green electricity subscribers differ from those that display strong preferences towards green electricity but have not yet 'walked the talk'. By making use of a latent class segmentation analysis based on choice-based conjoint data, this paper identifies three groups of potential green electricity adopters with varying degrees of preference for renewable energy. Findings indicate that socio-demographic factors play a marginal role in explaining the differences between green electricity subscribers and potential adopters, with the exception that actual adopters tend to be better educated. Analysis of psychographic and behavioral features reveals that adopters tend to perceive consumer effectiveness to be higher, place more trust in science, tend to estimate lower prices for green electricity tariffs, are willing to pay significantly more for other eco-friendly products and are more likely to have recently changed their electricity contract than non-adopters.

The proposed framework systematically addresses the challenges faced when the future value of customers is estimated based on survey data. The scarcity of the survey data and the sampling variance are countered by utilizing the prior information and quantifying the uncertainty of the CE and CLV estimates by posterior distributions. Furthermore, information on the purchase behavior of the customers of competitors available in the survey data is integrated to the framework. The introduced approach is directly applicable in the domains where a customer relationship can be thought to be monogamous. As an example on the use of the framework, we analyze a consumer survey on mobile phones carried out in Finland in February 2013.

This study uses aggregate panel data on general practitioner (GP) services at the Statistical Local Area level in Australia spanning eight years to estimate supply and demand equations for GP services. The structural equations of the model are estimated separately using population-weighted fixed effects panel modelling with the two stage least squares formulation of the generalised method of moments approach (GMM (2SLS)). The estimated price elasticity of demand of is comparable with other studies. The direct impact of GP density on demand, while significant, proves almost immaterial in the context of near vertical supply curves. Supply changes are therefore due to shifts in the position of the curves, partly determined by a time trend. The model is validated by comparing post-panel model predictions with actual market outcomes over a period of three years and is found to provide surprisingly accurate projections over a period of significant policy change. The study confirms the need to jointly consider supply and demand in exploring the behaviour of physician services markets.","[McRae, Ian] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Primary Hlth Care Res Inst, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Butler, James R.

A common puzzle is however whether engaged non-state actors represent already strong and established interests or if they also bring forth marginalised voices. This concern raises the pertinent question of what views non-state actors actually represent and if this adds to the perspectives voiced by state actors. This paper examines the views held and voiced by state and a range of non-state participants at the United Nation's climate change conferences. Specifically, questions on what types of climate change solutions are favoured and to what extent these solutions are discussed are addressed. Through statistical analyses of questionnaire data and a content analysis of abstracts of side-events to the conferences, we find that while non-state actors help in broadening the discursive space, some perspectives remain marginalised. We conclude that while non-state actors represent a pluralising force, greater non-state actor participation in intergovernmental organisations is on its own unlikely to lead to democratic global governance.

In this paper, a model explores how the health of common pool resources could impact upon human capital outcomes for communities that struggle to find alternate livelihood options when traditional means such as agriculture become unsustainable. The management of common pool resources is modeled as a strategic interaction process between two heterogeneous communities that are directly or indirectly dependent upon it. An unconstrained harvesting of common resources such as forestry not only depletes its stocks, but it also indirectly affects crop output through soil degradation. A number of situations are constructed where communities are able to successfully finance human capital accumulation through proper management of their common pool resources. However, results also warn that communities that are faced with limited opportunities towards accumulating human capital must plan ahead to prevent the depletion of their common resources below critical levels. When non-linear feedbacks to soil degradation emanate from low levels of common pool stocks, human capital outcomes as well as future livelihoods of such communities are threatened.

Bidders coordinated their bids to form valid corridors and compete with other valid corridors to be successful. We tested the impact of bidding flexibility in terms of (a) bidders differentiating their offers for different eligible corridors and (b) bidders submitting a single offer that would automatically be considered for all eligible corridors. Within the bidding options, we compared the performance of the auctions under a net benefit and a benefit cost ratio selection criteria. We found that participants conditioned their offers in terms of corridor benefit information. As a consequence, allowing multiple offers significantly increased payment and rent extraction. On the other hand, a single offer restriction facilitated a higher proportion of valid agreements and reduced rent extraction and, as a result, the agency's payment. We could not find any significant difference between project selection criteria in terms of payment and rent extraction. These results provide important insights for policy makers engaged in conservation market design throughout the world. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Iftekhar, M.

This presented a challenge to the traditional suppliers of that market, butter producers from different European countries. We argue that the capacity to react quickly to the appearance of this cheap substitute by improving quality and establishing product differentiation was critical for the fortunes of butter producers. This is illustrated by a discussion of the different reactions to margarine and quality upgrading in Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A statistical analysis using monthly data for Britain from 1881-7 confirms that margarine had a greater impact on the price of poor quality butter than that of high quality butter, presumably because it was a stronger substitute.","[Lampe, Markus] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Sharp, Paul] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Southern Denmark,"Lampe, M (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,"Sharp, Paul/C-1027-2019; LAMPE, MARKUS/A-3308-2012","Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-0679-0106; LAMPE, MARKUS/0000-0002-0859-5091",,,,,84,9,10,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Regarding CO2, mitigation strategies would require cuts in emissions of around 80-90% with respect to 1990 by 2050 in the EU. We investigate whether complementarity, namely integration, between the adoption of environmental innovation measures and other technological and organizational innovations is a factor that has supported reduction in CO2 emissions per value added, that is environmental productivity. We merge new EU innovation and WIOD data to assess the innovation effects on sector CO2 performances at a wide EU level. We find that jointly adopting different innovations is not a widespread factor behind increases in environmental productivity. Nevertheless, even though complementarity is not a low hanging fruit, a case where 'innovation complementarity' arises is for manufacturing sectors that integrate eco-innovations with product innovations. One example of this integrated action is a strategy that pursues energy efficiency with product value enhancement. We believe that the lack of integrated innovation adoption behind environmental productivity performance is a signal of the current weaknesses economies face in tackling climate change and green economy challenges. Incremental rather than more radical strategies have predominated so far. The latter have been confined to industrial 'niches', in terms of the number of involved firms. This is probably insufficient when we look at long-term economic and environmental goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The answer inherently involves addressing the issues of system boundaries, statistical units and a vision of sustainability. As an analytical answer we offer the Intenscope (IS), a two-dimensional graphical tool based on dimensionless percentages of triple rate ratios which overcomes several limitations of sustainability analyses. First, it is not sensitive to the size of statistical units so an area with twice the amount of resources of another, with double the population (and double the total consumption) would have the same triple ratio of population:biocapacity:consumption. Second, the IS is sensitive to anomalies which may originate either from the use of arbitrary statistical units (e.g. the boundaries of a city) or those which may indicate truly unsustainable practices. To judge spatial sustainability we use ecological footprint data from which we construct a plausible country plot based on the IS. Despite the relative nature of IS-analyses, the employed consumption:biocapacity ratio inherently refers to the absolute limit of sustainability: we cannot continually use more resources on a global scale than nature provides us with.

It is a multi-rate discounting scheme, which draws on concepts from dual-rate and time-declining approaches. Each damage component is discounted at a component-specific constant rate, related to its time-trajectory. Assuming a normatively defined declining schedule of rates as a starting reference, components with longer time profiles - generally represented by welfare losses - are discounted at lower rates than short-term damage components - mainly remedial costs. The rationale behind this choice is that the longer the duration of the damage component, the higher the related nonincident specific uncertainty on the resource values and the more relevant the equity issues. When estimating the total damage, the resulting implicit average discount rate depends on the duration of each component and its relative relevance in the total damage in each moment. From an operational point of view, anchoring the rates to government prescriptions would support the robustness of the damage estimates in a court of law, whereas the dual-based environmental discount rate is based on ad-hoc assumptions that are more difficult to justify.

The dataset is a balanced panel of 15 Estonian counties covering the period from 2000 to 2011. We consider a PCA-DEA model as an alternative method to estimate and predict QOL scores and rankings of Estonian counties. The method consists of a two-stage analysis that begins with a principal component analysis. In the second stage, the standard DEA is used. The results from the conventional DEA model and the PCA-DEA model are compared and discussed. A comparison of the methodologies demonstrates that a PCA-DEA model provides a powerful tool for performance ranking. The rankings of Estonian counties using QOL scores for different model specifications are presented. Finally, the QOL ranking of Estonian counties is revised using PCA-DEA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The article critically examines the outcomes of innovative governance responses to socio-ecological risk through an analysis of the roles of the cooperative organisation Genossenschaft Gran Alpin, according to the perceptions of its farmer members. Gran Alpin provides a secure premium price for cereal producers in Graubunden linked to the uniqueness of local organic mountain cropping systems, and all the values of local identity, landscape stewardship, biodiversity conservation and regional development that such systems represent. Gran Alpin is enabling an alternative approach for rural development to evolve around key elements, including: high quality breads, pastas, flours and beer; the mountains; the extreme production system; organic production and animal welfare; landscapes aesthetics in a core tourism region; and the cooperation of like-minded farmers. Resilience within the socio-ecological system is enhanced as the cooperative exploits evolving forms of collaboration, market niches, and private and public governance relationships to respond implicitly and explicitly to agro-ecological, economic and political risks.

Optimal control deals with the problem of finding a control law for a given system such that a certain optimality criterion is achieved. Optimal control theory, an extension of the calculus of variations, is a mathematical optimization method for deriving control policies. The calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima of functionals, which are collectively called extrema. The brachistochrone problem, a priori a simple game for mathematicians, turns out in the end to be a considerable problem. Indeed, the different approaches tried out in its solution may be considered, in a more or less direct way, as the starting point for new theories. While the true mathematical demonstration involves what we now call the calculus of variations, a theory for which Euler and then Lagrange established the foundations, the solution which Johann Bernoulli originally produced, obtained with the help analogy with the law of refraction on optics, was empirical. A similar analogy between optics and mechanics reappears when Hamilton applied the principle of least action in mechanics which Maupertuis justified in the first instance, on the basis of the laws of optics.","Univ Econ, Fac Stat & Informat, Dept Math, Prague 14800 4, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Coufal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Stat & Informat, Dept Math, Prague 14800 4, Czech Republic.",jan.n.coufal@seznam.cz,,,,,,,11,1,1,3,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,273,283,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700027,0

In this paper we consider the role of emotions in heterogeneous responses of individuals in the non-market valuation of an oil prevention program in Spain. Heterogeneity is modeled with a smoothly mixing regression (SMR) model that allows researchers to explain the probability that individuals belong to the latent segments of WTP. The results show that heterogeneity in WTP responses is explained by the specific emotional reactions of individuals (upset, sadness, indifference) rather than by their socioeconomic characteristics. Thus, the investigation of the emotional reactions of individuals can provide useful tools for the design of non-market valuation studies, providing more accurate predictions of the potential behavior of individuals in constructed markets for damage assessment.

Also, one part of the cluster analysis is very often to determine the number of clusters. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the CHF coefficient, which is often used to determine the number of clusters. There will be used 20 artificially created files for clustering. Conditions are, that the clusters must be touched or partially overlapped. These generated files are created under the same conditions in order to consider the objective results. Based on analyses it was found, that the CHF coefficient is very successful in determining the number of clusters. In the case that the clusters are touched to each other, its success is 100 % at the generated files. In the case that the clusters are partially overlapped, its success decreases. The highest success in the case of partially overlapped clusters was 70 %. It can be concluded, that the lower rate of separation is, (i.e. the more individual clusters are overlapped), the lower is the success of this coefficient in order to determine the number of clusters.","Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Löster, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",tomas.loster@vse.cz,"Löster, Tomáš/N-2754-2017",,,,,,17,10,10,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,858,869,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700084,0

A sample of 165 buying companies and a sample of 96 sellers were analyzed by partial least square modeling. Findings - Communication willingness plays a critical role in improving communication quality and realizing potential communication benefits. Modern media remain as a huge potential opportunity for improving performance. Meanwhile, the power of face-to-face communication should never be neglected, even in the coming Information Age. Higher communication frequency contributes to better understanding of companies' changing requirements and expectations. Taking use of senior managers and staff from different functions helps sellers grasp better changing markets.

One of the most challenging practical problems is to understand and model a behavior of volatility dynamics through different time periods. In this paper, we deal with an impact of structural breaks on volatility persistence with a help of Iterated Cumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) algorithm. The aim of this paper is to identify sudden breaks in volatility of financial time series which usually correspond to political or economic events, and measure an impact of these sudden breaks on volatility persistence. When incorporating those breaks into conditional volatility models, long memory property usually significantly disappears. Volatility persistence is estimated using (FI)GARCH family models in two regimes: without sudden breaks and with sudden breaks which are incorporated in volatility models in terms of dummy variables. Empirical analysis is provided on illustrative example using sample data from developed and emerging stock markets. Namely, we consider weekly data of S&P500, WIG20 and PX indexes in the period of 2004 - 2013 years which also includes the stage of recent global financial crisis of 2008-2009 years. Our findings mean that when ignoring an impact of sudden breaks on volatility it leads to overestimation of volatility persistence.","VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Sed'a, P (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",petr.seda@vsb.cz,"Seďa, Petr/X-1866-2018","Seďa, Petr/0000-0002-2205-6377",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1326,1336,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700129,0

Exits are central to the venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) process because financial returns are primarily derived from capital gains upon sale, and not dividends on equity. Even though exit strategies are placed as the last part of the PE process, they are so crucial that they are already planned prior to the initial investment. This article reviews the pre-existing literature and examines the potential factors that might affect PE exit outcomes in terms of initial public offerings (IPOs), trade sales, secondary sales, buybacks and write-offs. Findings indicate that Poland is similar to the other CEE countries with respect to exit route strategies for private equity managers. Divestments have been performed mainly through trade sales of companies to strategic investors and not through IPOs despite the fact that Poland hosts one of the most active European stock exchanges. In the years 2008 through 2012, exit activity was concentrated in a few countries, with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland accounting for 81% of the total exit value at investment cost in the CEE region.","Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Soloma, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ, Ul Oczapowskiego 4, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland.",soloma@uwm.edu.pl,,"soloma, andrzej/0000-0002-5603-2496",,,,,20,3,3,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1397,1406,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700136,0

The synthetic measure of development proposed by Zdzislaw Hellwig is one of the methods of linear arrangement. It enables the classification of companies in relation to the set variables. In case of the paper the set variables are financial ratios. The purpose of the paper is to choose which set variables: financial ratios describing each area of company activity or leverage ratios should be used in order to point out stocks for the portfolio. Companies are divided into five quantile portfolios due to their position in the ranking that is constructed on the base of the synthetic measure of development. The synthetic measure of development is computed using given set variables. The author uses data of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2001 and 2011. The rankings and portfolios are built separately for each year. As a result, it can be stated that the third portfolio of the ranking constructed on the base of leverage ratios is better than any portfolio constructed on the base of all chosen financial ratios.","Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Appl Math, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Wegrzyn, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Appl Math, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",tomasz.wegrzyn@ue.katowice.pl,"Wegrzyn, Tomasz/X-6849-2018",,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1654,1663,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700162,0

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a formal econometric model of risk analysis to provide empirical evidence on the determinants of non-compliance in organic farming. A panel of data from the archives of the largest control body in the UK for 2007-2009 is used, and specific analyses are performed for two types of non-compliances. A zero inflated count data model is used for the estimation, taking into account the fact that the occurrences of non-compliance are very sparse. Findings - Results show the existence of strong co-dependence of non-compliant behaviours (i.e. the occurrence of major and critical non-compliance increases the probability of occurrence of the minor one; similarly the probability of occurrence of major non-compliance increases when minor noncompliance occur). Besides, livestock production and farm size are relevant risk factors. Research limitations/implications - Albeit highly representative, the findings are based on Soil Association data only and not on all UK organic farms. Practical implications - The paper provides practical indications for control bodies, concerning aspects that could be strengthened for more efficient risk-based inspections. The paper advocates the use of financial information like turnover or capital stock, and of data concerning the characteristics of the farmers, that could substantially improve the probability of detecting the most severe non-compliances. Social implications - Certification is essential for organic farming, and an improvement of inspection procedures through a risk-based approach could add efficiency and effectiveness to the whole organic food system, with obvious advantages for consumers and the society as a whole. Originality/value - This paper provides for the first time empirical evidence concerning the implementation of the organic certification system in the UK.","[Zanoli, Raffaele; Gambelli, Danilo; Solfanelli, Francesco] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali D3A, Ancona, Italy; [Padel, Susanne] Elm Farm, Organ Res Ctr, Newbury, Berks, England",Marche Polytechnic University,"Zanoli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali D3A, Ancona, Italy.",zanoli@agrecon.univpm.it,"Padel, Susanne/M-7044-2017; Gambelli, Danilo/HIR-8625-2022; Zanoli, Raffaele/I-4476-2012","Solfanelli, Francesco/0000-0002-4322-8078; GAMBELLI, Danilo/0000-0002-1399-8303; Zanoli, Raffaele/0000-0002-7108-397X; Padel, Susanne/0000-0001-7762-5592",CERTCOST Project [207727]; European Community,CERTCOST Project; European Community,"This publication originates from the research made in the CERTCOST Project, Agreement No. 207727 (www.certcost.org), with financial support from the European Community under the 7th Framework Programme.

First, using a life cycle emissions methodology developed in Lenski et al. (2010), we find that about 29,000 metric tons of criteria pollutant emissions were avoided, fora benefit of about $23 million; avoided carbon dioxide emissions, by comparison, provided a benefit worth $90 million. Second, we compare the market value of scrapped vehicles to the rebates provided, calculating the consumer surplus or gift to participants to be up to $2 billion (about $2000 to $3000 per vehicle). This is significantly more than offered in previous vehicle scrappage programs, and suggests opportunities to get more environmental and economic bang for the buck. Finally, these two categories of benefits are found to be heavily concentrated geographically around urban centers. About 2% of US counties (50 counties) received 50% and 30% of the aggregate benefits from avoided criteria pollutant emissions and consumer surplus from the rebates, respectively.

Although average yields in Spain were below those in other countries of north-western Europe, the provinces in the north achieved yields not far behind the most advanced agricultural regions of the world. The heterogeneity of yields across Spain can be explained by the different climatic conditions in each province.

Using a comprehensive, multiyear database of patent applications, we investigate whether the knowledge creation network profiles are discriminating characteristics of metropolitan regions by establishing a new urban taxonomy for metropolitan areas in the United States. The four-class taxonomy is not only statistically significant, but it is also economically meaningful in terms of economic performance of metropolitan areas. We find that metropolitan areas benefit from a higher density of inventors in the population, and that there is a positive correlation between economic performance and metropolitan areas with inventor teams working in similar or complementary areas of technology. In fact, the structure of knowledge creation networks are fundamental to economic performance and extends to metropolitan growth rates in jobs and income.","[Strumsky, Deborah; Thill, Jean-Claude] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Thill, Jean-Claude] Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy Program, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Strumsky, D (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",dstrumsky@uncc.edu; Jean-Claude.Thill@uncc.edu,"Strumsky, Deborah A/HSE-8706-2023",,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0939910] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,62,21,25,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

New Jersey sponsors such municipal action through the Green Acres Program by providing funding and low interest loans to towns that choose to increase property taxes and spend the money raised on open space preservation for the purposes of conservation and/or recreation. This paper endeavors to understand which factors contribute to the appearance and success of these measures. Although previous literature has examined this issue, this is the first study to account for spatial dependence/spatial autocorrelation and to explore dynamic issues through survival analysis. The traditional two stage model from the literature is extended by incorporating a Bayesian spatial probit for the first stage and a maximum-likelihood spatial error model in the second stage. A Cox-proportional hazard model is used to examine the timing of referenda appearance. Spatial dependence is found in the second stage of the analysis, indicating that future studies should account for its influence. There is no strong evidence for spatial dependence or correlation in the first stage. The survival model is found to be a useful complement to the traditional probit analysis of the first stage.

It estimates rice crop WP for 21 Bangladesh districts for 37 years; explores WP variations among districts; and investigates causality involving WP, intensification and technological variables; and groundwater irrigation and depth. It breaks new grounds by probing these significant but unexplored issues. Technological diffusion was the key factor explaining inter-district WP differences. The impact of agricultural intensification on rabi (dry season) and kharif (wet season) crop WPs was positive and negative respectively. Dummy variables typifying policy transition negatively impacted on WPs for both kharif and overall crops. While rabi and kharif rice WPs grew with time, overall crop WP recorded the strongest growth. Rabi and overall WPs were lower in salinity- and drought-prone districts covering 33% of Bangladesh's net cropped area (NCA). In 90% of Bangladesh's NCA districts, technological diffusion caused WP. Causality existed between groundwater irrigation and depth in 60% NCA. Despite significant potential to increase WP, increasing dependence on groundwater appears unsustainable. Widespread diffusion of HYVs in the kharif season, and development of salinity and drought-tolerant rice varieties could go a long way in sustaining rice WP. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, despite some rhetorical progress at the 2011 Durban climate conference, it has consistently rejected calls to take on binding targets to reduce its GHG emissions. The Chinese Government has understandably argued that developed states are responsible for the predominant share of historical GHG emissions, have greater capacity to pay for the cost of mitigation, and indeed have an obligation to do so before China is required to take action. However, due to the explosive growth in its GHG emissions, China is now in a position to single-handedly dash any hope of climate stability if its position does not change. On the diplomatic level, other big polluters, particularly the United States, will not enter into new binding agreements to reduce substantially their own GHG emissions without a credible commitment from China. Challenging the statist framing of the climate justice, this article explores the possibility for China to take on a leadership role in climate change diplomacy in a way that allows it to maintain its long-standing principled resistance to binding national emissions targets while making meaningful progress toward combating the problem. Action by China's rapidly growing affluent classes may hold the key to long-term climate stability.","[Harris, Paul G.; Chow, Alice S.

Using both an analytical and a numerical model, we find that if there is a risk that the carbon price drops to zero and if the political unavailability of a CO2 tax (at least in the European Union) is taken into account, it can be socially beneficial to implement an additional instrument encouraging the reduction of emissions, for instance a renewable energy subsidy. Our analysis has both a practical and a theoretical purpose. It aims at giving economic insight to policymakers in a context of increased uncertainty concerning the future stringency of the European Emission Trading Scheme. It also gives another rationale for the use of several instruments to cover the same emission sources, and shows the importance of accounting for corner solutions in the definition of the optimal policy mix.

Particularly in low-income countries, nontimber forest product (NTFP) extraction by rural people, which provides important resources and income to the rural poor, contributes to the level and pattern of forest degradation. Although recent policy, particularly in Africa, emphasizes forest degradation, relatively little research describes the spatial aspects of NTFP collection that lead to spatial degradation patterns. This paper reviews both the spatial empirical work on NTFP extraction and related forest degradation patterns, and spatial models of behavior of rural people who extract NTFPs from forest. Despite the impact of rural people's behavior on resulting quantities and patterns of forest resources, spatial-temporal models/patterns rarely inform park siting and sizing decisions, econometric assessments of park effectiveness, development projects to support conservation, or REDD protocols. Using the literature review as a lens, we discuss the models' implications for these policies with particular emphasis on effective conservation spending and leakage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Railways proved to be efficient, and in the 1840-1870 period were essential for the industrialization of the Ruhr area. The key questions addressed in this article are: why did inland navigation not disappear from the Rhine region (as it did elsewhere), even recovering after the 1870s? And why did it have an unassailable competitive advantage from the 1890s onwards? Political developments leading to the liberalization of Rhine shipping and the canalization of the river created the opportunity to increase the scale of shipping. This gave it competitive advantages when it came to bulk transport. This article uses new data on freight rates in the Rhine delta to demonstrate the course of Rhine competitiveness. Furthermore, it identifies the institutional conditions, and the technological and organizational improvements, that were the basis of this growing competitiveness. The conclusion is that the element of German international trade that went by the Rhine correlated with the cost of Rhine shipping when compared to that of railway transport. As a consequence of the recovery of Rhine shipping, the port of Rotterdam became stronger than its Belgian neighbour, Antwerp.","[Klemann, Hein A.

Growing human populations throughout the greater Serengeti ecosystem rely heavily on bushmeat as a source of protein, which places pressure on migratory wildlife populations. This paper uses unique data from protein consumption surveys from 131 households over 34 months in a generalizable empirical framework to estimate price, cross-price, and expenditure elasticities of protein sources, and analyze the potential economic effects of policies to mitigate bushmeat hunting and consumption. Results suggest that: (1) directly increasing the price of bushmeat through enforcement or other policies to reduce supply will have the most-direct and largest effect of bushmeat consumption; (2) increasing income increases bushmeat consumption as well as consumption of other meat sources; (3) if surrounding fisheries experience a negative shock, or collapse, this will lead to a dramatic increase in bushmeat consumption. Overall, these results strongly indicate that policies to reduce bushmeat hunting while maintaining food security must be considered in a broad and comprehensive framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to these two established types of capital, this paper introduces the idea of 'behavioral capital'. We define behavioral capital as the latent potential of behavioral change to affect improvement in environmental quality. Our contribution argues that technological and traditional regulatory innovations serve as insufficient tools for addressing modern environmental issues and ensuring sustainable development. Without discarding these solutions, we contend that because human behavior is a significant contributor to environmental problems, it should be regarded as a key component of continued solutions. We suggest that the dual interest theory can serve as an integrative framework for behavioral innovations related to environmental issues. In suggesting this, we assume that behavioral innovations can both overcome some of the limitations of technological innovations and offer new solutions. Our main insight is to suggest that some depletion of natural capital - but not all - can be offset by behavioral changes without decreasing, or even increasing, subjective well-being.

There have been a number of arguments put forward for market failures that may account for urban sprawl, including incomplete pricing of infrastructure, environmental externalities, and unpriced congestion. The problem analyzed here is that urban growth creates benefits for an entire urban area, but the costs of growth are borne by individual neighborhoods. An externality problem arises because existing residents perceive the costs associated with the new residents locating in their neighborhoods, but not the full benefits of new entrants which accrue to the city as a whole. The result is that existing residents have an incentive to block new residents to their neighborhoods, resulting in cities that are less dense than is optimal, or too spread out. The paper models several different types of urban growth, and examines the optimal and local choice outcomes under each type. In the first model, population growth is endogenous and the physical limits of the city are fixed. The second model examines the case in which population growth in the region is given, but the city boundary is allowed to vary. We show that in both cases the city will tend to be larger and less dense than is optimal. In each, we examine the sensitivity of the model to the number of neighborhoods and to the size of infrastructure and transportation costs. Finally, we examine optimal subsidies and see how they compare to current policies such as impact fees on new development.","[Cinyabuguma, Matthias; McConnell, Virginia] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Cinyabuguma, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Econ, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",matthias@umbc.edu; mcconnel@umbc.edu,,,,,,,32,12,14,1,50,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The area of interest is the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, although the evidence presented provides salient lessons for a range of settings. We draw on the transaction cost literature where the tasks of re-designing and using institutions can help conceptualise the costs associated with policy change. A framework for improving ex ante assessment of transaction costs and its relationship to transformation or abatement costs is elaborated, especially as it relates to community consultation exercises. Against the background of the water reforms of the past three decades we conclude that policy makers and administrators could limit increases in transformation costs and contain transaction costs by giving greater attention to the form of community consultation, by taking account of the sources of uncertainty that attend policy choices and recognising the potential for consultation fatigue.

A theoretical model explains the need to offer positive incentives to slaves working in occupations characterized by a high degree of asymmetric information. As a result, masters freed ( and, more generally, rewarded) slaves who performed well. The model's implications are then tested against the available evidence: both in Rome and in the Atlantic world, slaves with high asymmetric information tasks had greater chances of manumission. The analysis also sheds light on the master's choices of carrots versus sticks and of labor versus slavery.

We examine newly available measurements of personal exposure to air contaminants at 1333 plants in the US chemical manufacturing sector between 1984 and 2009. The maximum ratio of exposure to the legal limits per inspection declined substantially, by 11%, in the post-program period. This result provides the first evidence of a reduction in measured risks coinciding with the inception of the TRI program. We find suggestive, not conclusive, evidence to attribute this reduction in part to the TRI program. Our preferred specifications find that plants that are more responsive to the TRI program, as indicated by larger industry-level TRI emission reduction, had 6.5% to 8% lower exposure. However, not all models find statistically significant larger exposure reductions in plants that are more responsive to the TRI program. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Conventionally, preference convergence toward consensus among initially disagreeing decision makers is understood in terms of diminishing value differences. A cogent account of consensual decision that respects non-diminishing value plurality is lacking. Instead there is a theoretic expectation for categorical consistency between subjective values and expressed preferences. Valuing agents in social interaction are expected to indicate identical preference orderings only if they hold correspondingly identical categories of values. This expectation precludes meaningful conceptualization of preference convergence under divisive normative dispositions. An alternative framework is proposed and illustrated by results from a designed deliberative forum on Australia's climate change policy. Data were analyzed based on Q methodology. Results show that small-group deliberations enabled effective communication between distinctive subjective positions and broadened understandings between individuals. While a consensual decision gained progress, no identified value discourse diminished below a significant degree. Observed changes in values did not run parallel to the converging preferences, suggesting a decline in value-preference consistency. These changes nonetheless are amenable to the principle of value pluralism. An alternative rationality concept is needed to account for this moral ideal within economics. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We document here the views of indigenous Australians in a community in Arnhem Land about their motivations for, and ways to provide, such services. Most respondents (93%) said that they 'look after country' to fulfil cultural responsibilities. Natural resource management, they said, should be carried out communally, primarily under the direction of elders and family. Sixty percent of respondents preferred direct payments such as cash or salaried remuneration like that commonly offered in return for ranger-like activities such as feral animal/weed control, coastal surveillance and prescribed burning. Some (14%) either did not want or did not need rewards for environmental service provision. Others (19%) preferred rewards in a form that benefited their community or family rather than themselves as individuals. There was agreement that outcomes should be monitored, consistent with the principle that reward payments should be conditional on performance. We suggest that a reward system that is too narrowly defined could thwart the potential for win-win outcomes from indigenous incentive-based natural resource management but that their articulation could allow solutions to be negotiated.

A long-term view indicates that this was a period of expansion in coin use, although growth in this area remained limited compared to the later middle ages, or even the eighth century. Within the eleventh century single-finds suggest more specific developments, including a decline in coin use after the Norman Conquest, and substantial short-term fluctuations related to various economic and monetary factors. Comparison with estimates of coin production suggests a general trend for more of mints' output to enter domestic circulation after c. 1030/40, though this need not solely reflect an increase in monetization. These chronological changes are compared with the pattern of circulation within England. Overall, the kingdom enjoyed a unified currency which did not see marked localization of coin circulation. Parts of northern England were less integrated with the south, but not so far as to suggest active exclusion of non-local coin. More striking was a general trend for both production and circulation to be concentrated in the east and the south.","Univ Cambridge Clare Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TL, England",University of Cambridge,"Naismith, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge Clare Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TL, England.",,,,,,,,141,12,13,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

A key theme is the extent to which ecosystem services are valued publicly, and the opportunity costs of not investing in the green infrastructure. We explore green infrastructure through pairing insights of social-ecological resilience with perspectives on urban infrastructure transitions. By converging these views, we show how green infrastructure can be viewed as an innovative response to challenged urban environments. Through a Johannesburg case study, a number of ecosystem services constitute sources of resilience for an otherwise constrained city. While this is positive and to be valorised, many South African cities are in the midst of service delivery protests, so that resilient ecosystems, and the citizen networks that sustain these, are largely overlooked in planning processes. This article offers three key conclusions. First, a proper understanding of green infrastructure requires blending insights from social-ecological system thinking and infrastructure transition scholarship. Second, there is a paucity of knowledge around ecosystem services in Johannesburg, and that the planning to facilitate ecosystem service valuation is largely inadequate. Third, addressing this requires ecosystem valuations relevant to the unique conditions in developing world cities such as Johannesburg. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses issues and implications of multidimensional poverty by adopting concepts commonly used in ecological economics. In particular, poverty is approached as an irreducible, complex phenomenon for which many legitimate, but non-equivalent descriptions exist. Issues of social and technical incommensurability are illustrated for different meanings and measurement types of poverty. Georgescu-Roegen's flow/fund framework is interpreted, informed by the capability approach of Amartya Sen. The paper argues that a predominant focus on flows as a proxy to analyze poverty represents rather a short-term perspective on access to satisfiers to fulfill particular needs. Contrary to that, focusing on valued funds may provide useful information for the analysis of capabilities that persons and societies might pursue in the long term. Furthermore, it is argued that strong poverty alleviation needs to adopt analytical tools that can deal with non-trade-off cases: improvements in one poverty dimension cannot always compensate for the deterioration of other poverties. This implies to rethink the usefulness of aggregate multidimensional poverty indices, as well as the predominant use of income measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates current genetic resource exchange and use practices as a first step to better understand how the Protocol might affect US agricultural research. The paper addresses three main questions: (1) Who are the main actors sharing genetic resources in the US?; (2) What pathways exist for the exchange and how can they be characterized?; and (3) What consequences are expected to occur as a result of the potential implementation of the NP? Analysis of data from a 2011 national survey of government and university researchers shows that while many of the surveyed researchers are actively involved in exchange of genetic resources, few exchange large quantities of material. Pathways are best described as informal and based on expected reciprocity, and few report paying for genetic resources. While the use of material transfer agreements is low, use is associated with higher levels of expected reciprocity and intellectual property outcomes on projects. Conclusions discuss the implications of the findings for the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol and reflect on possible directions for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - Six focus group discussions were conducted to generate attitudinal data across three different adult consumer groups. Findings - Results revealed that consumers expected a healthy snack to contain low levels of calories, fat, salt and sugar, and to contain high levels of whole-grain, oats, bran, nuts, seeds, pulses and fruit, e.g. blueberries, cranberries, gogi berries. Additionally, healthy snacks were required to be free from any artificial colours, sweeteners and flavours. Major factors encouraging healthy snack consumption included reduced risk of weight gain, diabetes, heart burn and bloating. Conversely, perceived taste, portion size, the lack of available convenient nutritional snacks, accessibility and confusion over the credibility of the healthy product tag were the main factors preventing healthy consumption in the adult population examined. Consumers expressed a desire for a wider choice of filling snacks with specific health benefits for a variety of usage occasions, particularly those with associated health claims such as high fibre, omega 3 for mental health and reduces cholesterol. Research limitations/implications - The study sample size was not extensive and was limited to a small geographical spread of Dublin and Meath on the East coast of Ireland. A more representative sample of the entire Irish population could be the basis for further research. Practical implications - These findings increase the understanding of current expectations of the Irish adult consumer regarding healthy snack foods. They also highlight the potential new product development opportunities for snack food manufacturers to explore. Originality/value - The present paper focuses specifically on healthy snacks and contributes to a limited amount of existing literature by providing consumer research for the development of new healthy snack foods.","[Crofton, Emily C.; Scannell, Amalia G.

The goal of this research is to identify the drivers, and determine how they influence brand equity performance in the researched industry, in order to develop a more effective brand strategy. Design/methodology/approach The author studied an aggregate dataset for 739 food brands. Six predictors were controlled for (i.e. marketing investments, price, revenue, perceived quality [organic and functional] and brand ownership), while the impact of the brand equity drivers on brand value was estimated. The model was formulated and estimated using a robust OLS procedure. Several data sources have were in this study, such as market-based data from ACNielsen, as well as information and variable constructs using data from the Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing AIDA financial statements database. Findings Results suggest that marketing investment, price, revenue, brand ownership and perceived quality are highly associated with brand equity, and consequently with a higher brand value in the food industry. Research limitations/implications This study has only studied one industry (food), one industry segment (enriched-food) and one country (Italy). Originality/value The majority of marketing studies apply a single research approach and measures. This is the first study of brand equity that combines consumer, financial and marketing approaches. The model contributes to theory and practice in terms of suggesting which business drivers create brand value and what type of brand strategy a firm can apply in order to create brand value.","[Davcik, Nebojsa S.] Lisbon Univ Inst ISCTE IUL, ISCTE Business Sch, Lisbon, Portugal; [Davcik, Nebojsa S.] Lisbon Univ Inst ISCTE IUL, ISCTE Business Sch, BRU, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Davcik, NS (通讯作者)，Lisbon Univ Inst ISCTE IUL, ISCTE Business Sch, Lisbon, Portugal.",davcik@live.com,"Davcik, Nebojsa/E-6816-2011","Davcik, Nebojsa/0000-0003-1041-8788","MIUR, grant [2006072800_003]","MIUR, grant(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This research is partially funded by the PRIN 2006 of MIUR, grant: 2006072800_003.

To this end, a hurricane damage index is derived from a physical wind field model for a panel of Caribbean countries over 36 years. Results, based on panel VAR and impulse response functions analysis, show that, overall, hurricane strikes exert a short-term impact. Indeed, the study finds that the response of government spending is positive and significant while public investment, debt and tax revenue do not appear to respond (significantly) to hurricane strikes. Moreover, the study finds that Governments respond to hurricane strikes by engaging in short term deficit financing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - A 100 per cent wheat flour (WF) formulation was substituted with 30, 50 and 70 per cent oat flour (OF) or oat bran (OB) to improve its nutritional quality characteristics of bread. The flour blends were evaluated for quality characteristics (loaf volume, texture profile analysis) and p-glucan analysis during different stages of the bread baking process. Findings - A significant decrease in specific volume, number of cells and crumb brightness was observed with increasing WF substitution levels with OF or OB. The crumb hardness was observed to be negatively correlated with specific volume of OF (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001) and OB (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001) bread. The level of P-glucan was significantly reduced by 37.8 - 42.9 per cent in dough during 45 min fermentation time, which indicating the enzymatic action. The p-glucan content of OF and OB bread was found to increase from 0.13 g/100 g bread (db) (control) to 1.35 and 3.61g beta-glucan/100 g bread (db) for 70 per cent WF substitution with OF and OB, respectively. Results show that a bread of acceptable quality can be prepared by substituting WF by up to 50 per cent for OF and up to 30 per cent by OB. Practical implications - Replacing white bread with oat flour/bran containing beta-glucan facilitates human consumption of soluble dietary fibre. Originality/value - The paper provides a comparative evaluation of the oat flour and/or bran based bread and its critical factors influencing the level of p-glucan during baking process, which attributes to improve the nutritional quality.","[Tiwari, Uma; Cummins, Enda; O'Donnell, Colm] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr Food Sci & Vet Med, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Brunton, Nigel; Gallagher, Eimear] Ashtown Food Res Ctr, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; Teagasc,"Tiwari, U (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr Food Sci & Vet Med, Dublin 2, Ireland.",uma.tiwari@ucd.ie,"Brunton, Nigel Patrick/K-2211-2012; Cummins, Enda/AAE-7050-2019; O'Donnell, Colm/H-2384-2015","Brunton, Nigel Patrick/0000-0002-5893-1751; Cummins, Enda/0000-0001-5401-5791; O'Donnell, Colm/0000-0003-1729-6074; Tiwari, Uma/0000-0001-6445-8502; O'donnell, Colm/0000-0002-8004-450X","FIRM Programme, Irish National Development Plan","FIRM Programme, Irish National Development Plan","The authors would like to thank Dolores Whelan (Flahavan & Sons Ltd, County Waterford, Ireland) for supplying oat flour for this study.

At the heart of such a transformation lies strong and coherent governance at all political levels, including the global level. While the need for global governance is taken for granted in a number of issue areas such as health, peacekeeping and environment, pursuit of global energy governance has been almost a taboo in political and foreign policy circles and has also had limited attention in the literature. In this paper, we explore how the viewing of a sustainable energy system as a global public good could serve as one approach to reducing the sensitivity towards global energy governance. The global public good concept together with the principle of subsidiarity is applied as a framework for understanding the role that the international community could play in, and the key ingredients for, global energy governance. Using two examples of international energy efficiency and renewable energy policy, we identify some types of international collaboration measures that would be both efficient and necessary to support a sustainable energy system.

The variation involves appointing a contemporary party to represent the interests of the affected parties who are currently unable to represent themselves. Potential criticisms of such a policy are considered and addressed, and precedents to such a policy are put forth. To test the value of such a policy, a two-period model in which two externalities exist in the production/consumption decisions and with representative agents is used to compare the welfare effects of four scenarios: 1) Agents in each period optimize their period-specific utility, 2) a benevolent social planner chooses allocations in both periods to maximize a social welfare function, 3) the externalities are internalized using a bargaining policy, and 4) the externalities are internalized using a tax and subsidy policy. I find that, contrary to general consensus in the literature, Coasian bargaining can be adapted in such a way as to make it applicable in an intergenerational framework. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The process focused on improving knowledge uptake and enabling dialogue among participants in order to develop adaptation strategies for Rottnest Island, off the Western Australian coast. Project results indicate increased levels of knowledge and commitment to active involvement in sustainability and climate change issues. Common threads came together in a coherent set of recommendations that will contribute to ongoing climate change and sustainability planning by the Rottnest Island Authority. Major conclusions drawn include: the usefulness of Google Earth for participatory planning for climate adaptation and sustainability; the methodology enables social, economic, ecological and cultural layers to be considered without any having primacy; care must be taken to ensure knowledge and power differential are managed effectively; and, the methodology brought together stakeholders and scientists to co-produce knowledge and decisions.

This study aims to address the stakeholders' multifaceted viewpoints on future sustainable development, mainly at regional scales. To this end, five experimental test cases - in the form of five different case studies in Europe - are analyzed, to encapsulate different approaches and different needs for sustainable development. A 'pentagon model' is used to represent systematically five critical aspects of sustainability. To analyze the trade-offs and synergies between different objectives on sustainable development, four distinct scenarios - competitiveness; continuity; capacity; and coherence - reflecting distinct and relevant images of sustainability are presented. The relative merits of these four scenarios are empirically assessed by means of a particular type of multi-criteria analysis: namely, regime analysis. The analysis is carried out by ranking different attributes of sustainable development, i.e. social, economic, ecological, institutional profile, and physical, from the perspective of different stakeholders. We find that the most preferred sustainable future is the coherence scenario, in which a combination of ecological and social aspects is the most important determinants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We also show that firms' Tobin Q and ECSR, strengths and concerns, are negatively correlated in a statistically significant way. However, accounting for the interaction between firms' environmental efforts and R&D yields a different perspective: while the direct impact of ECSR on CFP is still negative, the interaction of ECSR and R&D has a positive and significant impact on it. ECSR strengths and concerns harm CFP since they are perceived as a potential cost. However, this CSR activity fosters R & D efforts of firms which generates additional value (indirect effect).

However, income alone produces a static picture in a snapshot of time while poverty is a dynamic state that can be a transitory phenomenon. Using income only also fails to consider that households can liquidate asset to overcome income shocks. Here we show that using asset quintiles, measured by value of assets, produce a distinctly different pattern than the commonly observed negative relation between income and forest dependence. We then present an approach, enabling categorization of households as chronic or transient poor, transient rich and rich providing a more nuanced picture than that provided by CIFOR-PEN studies so far. The validity of groupings is tested by comparing household characteristics and exposure to shocks. We then show that the chronic poor are most reliant on forest income, while the transient poor consume a higher share of harvested forest products. The transient rich have higher agricultural productivity and absolute forest income. Rich households relies more on business. Based on the results we suggest recommendations for improving future studies on poverty-environment relations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Key to the success of Danish agriculture was an early diversification towards dairy production. This article challenges this simple story which sees Denmark as something of a liberal paragon. Denmark's success owed much to a prudent use of trade policy which favoured dairy production. Moreover, this favouritism continued even after a more general movement to free trade in the 1860s. Using micro-level data from individual dairies, we quantify the implied subsidy to dairy production from the tariffs, and demonstrate that in many cases this ensured the profitability of individual dairies.","[Henriksen, Ingrid; Sharp, Paul] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lampe, Markus] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",University of Copenhagen; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Henriksen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",,"Sharp, Paul/C-1027-2019; LAMPE, MARKUS/A-3308-2012","Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-0679-0106; LAMPE, MARKUS/0000-0002-0859-5091",,,,,49,21,21,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Through a multi-levelled analysis of water governance in the Orange-Senqu River basin in Southern Africa, this paper investigates the relationships between co-operative management norms constructed at different levels of scale, and the ways in which both norm and context are transformed as a result of the other. At the basin level, legal and institutional processes symbolise a movement towards norm convergence in the basin. However, norm drivers (such as technical co-operation, personalised politics, trust and confidence building) and norm barriers (such as skills flight and the lack of trust) to the development of a 'community of interest' in the Orange-Senqu River basin have also been significant in shaping the legal and normative landscape. An analysis of global, regional, basin-wide and local norms is therefore useful because it illustrates the interconnectedness of their interactions as well as how their content is affected.","Water Res Commiss, ZA-0031 Pretoria, South Africa",,"Jacobs, IM (通讯作者)，Water Res Commiss, Private Bag X03, ZA-0031 Pretoria, South Africa.",IngaJacobs30@gmail.com,,,,,,,77,14,14,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

On the one hand, there is an extensive historiography stressing the rise of nationalism and its close correlate of growing efforts to organize economic life along ethno-linguistic lines. On the other, there is a substantial body of research that emphasizes significant improvements in market integration across the empire as an outcome of the diffusion of industrialization and an expanding railway network, among other factors. In this article, it is argued that the process of market integration was systematically asymmetric, shaped by intensifying intra-empire nationality conflicts. While grain markets in Austria-Hungary became overall more integrated over time, they also became systematically biased: regions with a similar ethno-linguistic composition of their population came to display significantly smaller price gaps between each other than regions with different compositions. The emergence and persistence of this differential integration cannot be explained by changes in infrastructure and transport costs, simple geographical features, asymmetric integration with neighbouring regions abroad, or communication problems. Instead, differential market integration along ethno-linguistic lines was driven by the formation of ethno-linguistic networks due to intensifying conflict between groups-economic nationalism mattered.","[Schulze, Max-Stephan] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Wolf, Nikolaus] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Schulze, MS (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,"Wolf, Nikolaus/0000-0002-7461-2910",,,,,70,22,26,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Two basic notions of resilience are distinguished. With engineering resilience, there is an underlying stable growth path to which a regional economy rebounds following a shock. With ecological resilience, shocks can permanently affect the growth path of the regional economy. Our data set consists of quarterly employment series for 12 U.K. regions (NUTS I) for the period 19712010. Using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model specification, we test for the relevance of (engineering) resilience of U.K. regional employment to the four recessionary shocks in our sample. It turns out that U.K. regions do indeed differ in their resilience, but that these differences mainly concern the initial resistance to these shocks and not so much the recovery stage. The SUR model does not allow shocks to have permanent effects and it also does not take the possibility of time differentiated shock spillovers between the 12 regions into account. To this end, we also estimate a vector error-correction model (VECM) specification where employment shocks can have permanent effects and where also interregional employment linkages are included. We find that employment shocks typically have permanent effects when it concerns the own-region effects. Permanent effects can also be found for the impact on other regions but the interregional effects are typically only significant for nearby regions.","[Fingleton, Bernard] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Garretsen, Harry] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9712 CP Groningen, Netherlands; [Martin, Ron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge; University of Groningen; University of Cambridge,"Fingleton, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",bf100@cam.ac.uk; j.h.garretsen@rug.nl; rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Fingleton, Bernard/GZA-5738-2022; Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023","Fingleton, Bernard/0000-0001-7359-643X;",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,38,303,330,16,155,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Alternative land uses include planting leguminous forage species for cut-and-carry feeding of livestock, and raising sheep in folds (RSFs). In this study, an econometric model was used to quantify the factors determining farmers' decision to adopt RSFs in the area based on a survey of 213 farmer's families in four villages. The analysis showed that families with more female members and fewer children were more likely to adopt RSFs, as well as farmers with more experience raising sheep or goats, households located farther away from markets, and farmers with larger farm sizes and higher grain yields. In contrast, farmers who sold more potatoes, received higher incomes, were well educated or had non-farming sources of income were less likely to adopt RSFs. The probability of adopting RSFs was higher for farmers who have contact with extension agencies working on animal husbandry technologies. RSFs were very consistent with the needs and situations of farming families in the semiarid Loess Plateau. The results would be favor to make policies to improve the sustainability of crop livestock farming systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The main objective is to assess whether, and if so under which terms and conditions, rural households are willing to enter into contractual agreements to invest in soil conservation measures on their land. Participation constraints are tested under different soil erosion and institutional-economic conditions in a choice experiment targeting 750 rural households. We show that contracts provided by local government peasant associations offering additional credit, land use security and extension services could be an effective means to increase the share of farmers implementing soil conservation measures. However, trust in contract terms and conditions appears to play an important role. Farmers living in the most erosion prone areas are most likely to participate, while farmers taking soil conservation measures already are less likely to enter into a contractual agreement with the local government. Farmers not taking soil conservation measures will only do so if the contract price is lower than or equal to the income losses suffered from soil erosion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The authors aim to analyse its development model, marketing strategy, and competitive position. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the authors' own case study. They gathered the necessary information from company documents, both published and unpublished, as well as a series of in-depth interviews with representatives of Bakoma and other key players in the Polish dairy market. Findings - The authors found out a strong interdependence of the business and political spheres, especially during the initial phase of the Polish systemic transition. Secondly, foreign partners played a major role in the creation of the company (inflow of capital from an American businessman of Polish origin), acquiring access to technology licence (Onken), and capital investments and transfer of management skills (Danone). A major strength of the company is its innovative marketing strategy based on a perfect knowledge of the specificity of Polish consumer preferences. Nevertheless, the Polish yoghurt market as an important segment of the dairy market becomes gradually more and more dominated by multinational corporations, especially of French and German origin. Originality/value - This paper provides original insights into the development and marketing strategies of a leading Polish yoghurt company facing strong competition from multinationals.

FST should ask which scenarios lead to big loss with a given level of plausibility. However, traditional FSTs are criticized firstly for the plausibility that rose against stress testing and secondly, for being conducted outside the context of an econometric risk model. Hence, the probability of a sever scenario outcome is unknown and many scenarios yet plausible possibilities are ignored. The aim of this paper is to propose a new FST framework for analyzing stress scenarios for financial economic stability. Based on worst case scenario optimization, our approach is able first to identify the stressful periods with transparent plausibility and second to develop a methodology for conducting FST in the context of any financial-economic risk model. Applied to Tunisian economic system data, our proposed framework identifies more harmful scenarios that are equally plausible leading to stress periods not detected by classical methods.","[El Ghourabi, Mohamed; Dridi, Amira] LARODEC ISG Tunis, 41 Rue Liberte, Tunis 2000, Tunisia; [Landolsi, Mourad; Gamoudi, Imed] ESSEC Tunis, Tunis 1089, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis,"El Ghourabi, M (通讯作者)，LARODEC ISG Tunis, 41 Rue Liberte, Tunis 2000, Tunisia.",mohamed.elghourabi@gmail.com; Landolsi.mourad@gmail.com; amiradridi@laposte.net; imed.gamoudi@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,372,383,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500035,0

This paper aims to examine the characteristics of the people leading this phenomenon: those that prefer to buy locally produced food. Design/methodology/approach - In order to explore the characteristics of local food purchasers, a single item question, I try to buy a lot of locally produced food, was included in the food section of a New Zealand consumer lifestyles survey for which 3,556 responses were collected. The full survey included 600 questions across the full attitude, interest and opinion schedule. Findings - For people who express a strong intention to purchase local food, this behaviour is linked to the types of food they eat (e.g. unprocessed foods), where they buy it (e.g. at speciality stores), and how they cook it (e.g. follow recipes). A range of personality and other personal characteristics differ between local and non-local food buyers, with the former segment being more liberal, interested in quality, and frugal. Practical implications - Consumers who express an interest in purchasing local food are a demanding segment of the population whose interest in food makes them critical judges of produce.

Design/methodology/approach - Face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of Latin American immigrants in the Metropolitan area of Barcelona are undertaken. Ethnic identity is measured using the MEIM scale, which combines aspects from the social identity and personal development theories. Finally, a Multinomial Logit Model is used to identify the relationship between food habits and ethnical identity. Findings - Results indicate that the higher the level of ethnic identity and feeling of belonging of immigrants in Catalonia, the greater the persistence of dietary habits from the country of origin. Contrasting with results from other studies, no correlation is found between the persistence of dietary habits and either the length of time spent in Spain or the level of integration into the Catalan culture (measured through use of the Catalan language). Research limitations/implications - Findings should logically be interpreted within the context of the population and sample studied. Further research should be addressed to analyze other immigrant groups such as Muslims, Asians and Eastern Europeans. Originality/value - This study explores the strength of traditional food habits of immigrants living in a foreign cultural environment and the role of ethnic identity in contributing to this strength. While past literature focussing on this topic is based on atheoretical and partial indicators to measure ethnic identity, this study provides evidence on the usefulness of using a theory-based and multidimensional measure. The behaviour of Latin American immigrants in Spain is used as a case study.","[Gil, Jose M.] CREDA UPC IRTA, Ctr Res Agro Food & Dev Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Romo, Rodrigo] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Gest Empresarial, Chillan, Chile",IRTA; Universidad del Bio-Bio,"Gil, JM (通讯作者)，CREDA UPC IRTA, Ctr Res Agro Food & Dev Econ, Parc Mediterrani Tecnol, Barcelona, Spain.",chema.gil@upc.edu,"GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012","GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052; Romo Munoz, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6839-8834",,,,,29,14,15,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In this respect, this study is carried out with the aim of investigating the food safety knowledge, attitude and food handling practices of university students in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaires were applied to 1,340 people volunteered in the study, regarding their knowledge, attitude and practices. The research data was collected through a face-to-face questionnaire. An overall number of 1,340 university students from three different institutions were included in this study. Gender distribution was 54.6 per cent for male while that of female was 45.4 per cent, and age range was between 18-24 years. Findings - Depending on the respondents' gender, a statistically significant difference was found between male and female participants on total food safety knowledge, attitude and practice scores (p < 0.001). In addition, there was a statistically significant difference between students' institutes (p < 0.001). Also, a correlation was found between food safety knowledge attitude and practice (p < 0.001). Research limitations/implications - Because the population of this study consisted of university students from different faculties in the city of Ankara, the results cannot be generalized to all students or to all ages. Comment on the results is limited due to responses being self reported, which are prone to bias by the subjects. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, limited studies focused on university students have been found in the Turkish literature and there is a lack of study concerning food safety knowledge, attitude and practice of university students in Ankara, Turkey. The originality of this study is to assess the level of food safety attitude, knowledge and food handling practice to investigate the association between the students' institutions and gender among university students in Turkey. There is a need to assess the food safety knowledge, attitude and practice of this target group as they are more likely to engage in risky eating behaviors, thus are more susceptible to food-borne illnesses and they are more likely to engage in risky food handling practices because of their future roles as parents and food preparers for his/her family.","[Sanlier, Nevin] Gazi Univ, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Ankara, Turkey; [Konaklioglu, Ece] Gazi Univ, Tourism Management Educ Dept, Ankara, Turkey",Gazi University; Gazi University,"Sanlier, N (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Ankara, Turkey.",nevintekgul@gmail.com,"SANLİER, Nevin/W-7657-2018; KONAKLIOGLU, Ece/AAK-4282-2021; Çelik, Bülent/A-7793-2017; Konaklioglu, Ece/HPF-1099-2023","SANLİER, Nevin/0000-0001-5937-0485; Konaklioglu, Ece/0000-0001-9326-1610",,,,,39,43,47,1,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One of the pertinent issues, the future role of nuclear power, has gained increasing attention after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima, japan. As a contribution to preference elicitation, we test whether the relationship between subjective well-being (SWB) of European citizens and the supply of nuclear power has changed after the Fukushima nuclear accident of March 11, 2011. Survey data for about 124,000 individuals in 23 European countries reveal that while European citizens' SWB was statistically unrelated to the share of nuclear power before the Fukushima disaster, it was negatively related to the nuclear share after the disaster. Taking the relationship between SWB and the nuclear share as an indicator of preference, this suggests the existence of an induced preference change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It focuses on the supply side, to test the much criticized but never superseded vent-for-surplus' interpretation of the export expansion as a substitution of labour for leisure. The article argues that while the model captured certain features of the case, such as the application of labour to underused land, its defining claim about labour is without empirical foundation. Rather, the evidence points to a reallocation of resources from existing market activities towards the adoption of an exotic crop, entailing a shift towards a new, qualitatively different and more profitable kind of production function. This innovation is best understood in the context of the long-term search of African producers for ways of realizing the economic potential of their resource of relatively abundant land, while ameliorating the constraints which the environment put upon its use.","Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Austin, G (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,68,20,24,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

It combines insights from a theoretical model of North-to-South transfers with the findings of a calibrated dynamic multi-region multi-sector computable general equilibrium model that takes into account the impacts of climate change and the adaptation to it. Assessing the effects of adaptation funding indicates that funding of adaptation in developing regions can be Pareto-improving. Not only will developing regions, which do not own sufficient resources for adapting optimally, profit from receiving adaptation funding. Terms-of-trade improvements in the high and middle income donor countries can dominate transfer costs and hence lead to a net-welfare gain in almost any developed region except North America. As such our consideration adds a new argument for financially supporting adaptation in the developing world besides the well-known ones such as fairness and incentives for participation in a global climate treaty.

I argue that lay citizens, communities and local grassroots organisations immersed in socio-environmental conflicts are engaging with professional scientists to understand the impacts a polluting project is causing to their environment and themselves. Together with scientists they co-produce new and alternative knowledge that gives the local organisations visibility and legitimacy, information on how to protect themselves from the impacts, and allows them to engage in practical activism, challenging the manufactured uncertainty and other information produced by the state or companies running the projects. This process is what I term Activism Mobilising Science (AMS). It is locally driven by activists who have built related capacities and is generally based on voluntary work. AMS is compared to other participatory processes and gives clues into how grassroots organisations can avoid co-optation. The analysis is based on two uranium mining conflicts in Niger and Namibia where two local organisations are trying to confront the manufactured uncertainty of the nuclear industry through an AMS process.

The Tandroy people live in Androy, a region located in the southern part of Madagascar. They are mainly an agricultural and cattle herding society whose subsistence relies on the slash-and-burn farming agriculture (hatsake) and the burning of cacti which are given as fodder to the livestock (ororaketa). These activities generate ecological pressure on the surrounding dry forest and socioeconomic risks related to the lack of sustainability of these practices in the long run. In this paper we address the notion of sustainability and confront it with Tandroy's current productive and economic system. By means of the viability theory, we characterize the actions and scenarios that are compatible with a sustainable use of the forest in the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In order to capture the effect of countries compliance with the Kyoto protocol agreement (KPA) policies, we condition first the years since a country has signed the KPA until 2007 and secondly the obliged percentage level of countries' emission reductions. Particularly, various DEA models have been applied alongside with bootstrap techniques in order to determine the effect of KPA on countries' environmental efficiencies. The study illustrates how the recent developments in efficiency analysis and statistical inference can be applied when evaluating environmental performance issues. The results indicate a nonlinear relationship between countries' obliged percentage levels of emission reductions and their environmental efficiency levels. Finally, a similar nonlinear relationship is also recorded between the duration which a country has signed the KPA and its environmental efficiency levels.","[Halkos, George E.; Tzeremes, Nickolaos G.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Lab Operat Res, Volos 38333, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Halkos, GE (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Lab Operat Res, Korai 43, Volos 38333, Greece.",halkos@econ.uth.gr,"HALKOS, GEORGE/AAE-4772-2020; Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./AAF-6971-2020; Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./AAX-5079-2020","HALKOS, GEORGE/0000-0002-2772-5306; Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./0000-0002-6938-3404;",,,,,89,24,25,0,67,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Preserved as summaries of daily legal proceedings, they give historians a unique opportunity to access information about the names, characteristics, and socio-economic status of individuals and the laws, local customs, and legal institutions of societies. Although researchers have noted various limitations of these records, the problem of selection bias has not been systematically studied. Since litigants would probably settle disputes in which one side is likely to be a clear winner, the cases that go to trial are more likely to be the difficult and uncertain ones that comprise a non-random subset of all disputes. This article presents a study of selection bias in Ottoman courts in the town of Kastamonu in northern Anatolia, from the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Disputes are categorized by type and the distribution of court participants is studied according to composition, gender, and socio-religious status. A regression analysis is run to determine the factors affecting the likelihood of cases being tried in court. The results indicate that the cases that ended up in court were selected systematically. If the selection bias is ignored, research based on Ottoman court records may be seriously flawed in its ability to yield general conclusions.","[Ergene, Bogac A.] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Cosgel, Metin M.] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Ergene, Bogac A.] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Connecticut; University of Vermont,"Cosgel, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",,,,,,,,52,7,8,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Each of the services provided by a volcanic soil under a pastoral dairy use are quantified and valued. The six guiding principles underpinning the method developed include differentiating soil services from supporting processes; identifying key soil properties and processes behind each service; distinguishing natural capital from added/built capital; identifying how external drivers affect natural capital stocks; analysing the impact of degradation processes on soil properties and basing the economic valuation on measured proxies. Proxies to quantify ecosystem services focus on the part played by soil in generating each service. This new approach highlights the importance of soil change in quantifying services, and goes beyond simply determining the status of soil natural capital. The total value of the ecosystem services provided by a volcanic soil under dairy in the Waikato region in New Zealand was estimated at $16,390/ha/year on average over 35 consecutive years. The services with the highest value were the filtering of nutrients and contaminants (58-63% of total value), followed by the provision of food and then flood mitigation. Regulating services had an economic value 2.5 times more important than provisioning services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Schneider, EB",,,,"Schneider, Eric B.",,,Prices and production: agricultural supply response in fourteenth-century England,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MEDIEVAL; MARKETS; DEMESNE; WHEAT,"This article challenges the growing consensus in the literature that medieval manorial managers were price responsive in their production decisions. Using prices of and acreages planted with wheat, barley, and oats on manors held by the bishop of Winchester from 1325 to 1370, price elasticities of supply are estimated for each grain in aggregate and on each particular manor. Aggregate price elasticities of supply for wheat, barley, and oats were rarely statistically significant and when significant were very low compared with elasticities estimated for developing and developed countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The low levels of agricultural supply response in fourteenth-century England suggest that commercialization was not as dominant in the medieval economy as has been argued. Thus, structural changes in the economy, such as the leasing of demesnes, the growth of wage labour, and the end of villeinage, may have been more important than price fluctuations in driving long-run economic change after the Black Death. Likewise, a shift from low price responsiveness to higher price responsiveness could have been an important part of the capitalist transformation of agriculture in the early modern period.","[Schneider, Eric B.] Univ Oxford, Hist Fac, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Schneider, Eric B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Schneider, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Hist Fac, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,"Schneider, Eric/0000-0001-7682-0126",,,,,67,6,6,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The Czech Republic was an attractive country for foreign direct investment inflows in 90-ies, going from short-run to long-run investment, through investment incentives to structural changes of the Czech economy. The aim of the paper is to analyze the changes in FDI inflows coming from the beginning of the 21st century, affected by global financial crisis and stagnation of the Czech economy. The paper deals with the FDI effects assessment on the Czech economy (particularly concentrated on Moravian-Silesian region cases) and a glimpse of comparison to the situation in neighbouring countries. Moravian-Silesian region is the third most successful receiver of FDI in the Czech Republic. Some projects are perspective, although some others did not succeed.

The best-fit mathematical model was determined for the moisture sorption data of the mature harvested crop to be able to predict moisture status of the herb for various applications in future research and development and quality control. Test samples were collected at the recommended maturity stage when the first leaves started to dry and berries turned yellow. Moisture sorption isotherms were developed by the gravimetric static method at two pre-determined temperatures. 30 and 50 degrees C were selected based on the storage temperature and the conventional drying temperature, and at the water activity range of 0.05-0.83. Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC) was measured by the Dean and Stark method. The experimental results were compared with five selected sorption mathematical models: the Modified Henderson, Modified Chung-Pfost, Modified Halsey, Modified Oswin and GAB equations. The best-fit model was evaluated using statistical parameters: coefficient of determination (R-2), mean relative error, standard error of estimate and randomness of residuals. The GAB model was found to be the best-fit model for both adsorption and desorption data under both temperatures. Furthermore, 5% dry basis moisture content was found as the monolayer moisture content, which could be recommended as the final moisture content after drying for long-term storage without quality deterioration. The best relative humidity (RH) for packaging and long-term storage of the dried crop without moisture adsorption at the average room temperature of 30 degrees C was 20%.","[Dharmasena, D. A.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the availability, price, and nutritional composition of gluten-free products in retail stores of a Brazilian capital city. Design/methodology/approach - All retail stores listed by the Brazilian Coeliac Association as gluten-free product selling places in the city of Florianopolis were visited. All available products were catalogued and their labels analysed for nutritional content. Similar gluten-containing products were systematically selected in order to allow comparisons. t-test, analyses of covariance, and cluster analysis were performed, all considering a 5 per cent significance level. Findings - Availability and variety of gluten-free products was limited and prices were high. Cluster analysis found similarities in the nutritional content of gluten-free and conventional food products, suggesting that although raw materials different than wheat were being employed, the composition patterns are the same. Certain advantages in the composition of gluten-free products were observed, regarding mainly calories and sodium, however, protein and dietary fibre values were inferior. Social implications - Results observed may negatively impact diet adherence and stimulate the intake of conventional products with harmful consequences to the quality of life and health of coeliac individuals. Originality/value - This paper conducted a careful evaluation of nutrition composition of gluten-free products from different categories, available in retail stores, which is rare in researches on this topic. Moreover, results call attention to the need of better care in product formulation and dietary guidance for coeliac individuals.","[do Nascimento, Amanda Bagolin] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Programa Posgrad Ciencia Alimentos, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Rataichesck Fiates, Giovanna Medeiros] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Nutr, Programa Posgrad Nutr, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [dos Anjos, Adilson] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Estat, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [dos Anjos, Adilson] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Programa Posgrad Engn Prod, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [dos Anjos, Adilson] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Teixeira, Evanilda] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Programa Posgrad Ciencia Alimentos, Dept Ciencia & Tecnol Alimentos, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"do Nascimento, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Programa Posgrad Ciencia Alimentos, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",amandabagolin@hotmail.com,"Fiates, Giovanna M R/K-6711-2013; Bagolin do Nascimento, Amanda/A-4353-2015","Bagolin do Nascimento, Amanda/0000-0002-3527-3469",,,,,36,33,34,0,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a new halophyte recently cultivated in the Mediterranean region and it was tested in irrigation water salinity conditions. An experiment in pots was conducted in the south of Morocco in order to evaluate the responses of quinoa to different water salinity treatments (1, 10, 20 and 30 dS m(-1)). Adopted experimental design was cross-over with 8 replications for each treatment. Differences in water uptake, growth and yield were tested in order to put forward the relative mechanisms of quinoa to cope with salt-induced damage. The results showed a negative relationship between increasing water salinity and most of the measured plant growth parameters. Irrigation water salinity negatively affected growth and biomass accumulation and led to reduced grain yield, water uptake and water productivity. The added value of these results is that the crop responses to salinity are quantified. The obtained values can be used to determine ` threshold values'; should the salinity of the irrigation water go above these threshold values one may expect the crop yield parameters to be affected. The quantified responses also indicate the rate of change of yield parameters in response to the irrigation water salinity level. This could help in avoiding significant yield reduction when deciding on the irrigation water salinity level to be used for the studied quinoa cultivar.","[Hirich, A.; Choukr-Allah, R.; Jelloul, A.] Hassan II Inst, Agron & Vet Med, Agadir, Morocco; [Jacobsen, S. -E.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Life Sci, Dept Agr & Ecol, Hojbakkegard, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Hirich, A (通讯作者)，Hassan II Inst, Agron & Vet Med, Complex Hort, Agadir, Morocco.",,"Jacobsen, Sven-Erik/L-7351-2014; Hirich, Abdelaziz/L-1480-2015","Hirich, Abdelaziz/0000-0002-6660-6705",,,,,25,5,5,1,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,145,152,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1054.16,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400016,0

These new laws emphasized block-based, collectivized extraction a strategy incompatible with local communities' logging traditions and technical capacity. Field surveys before and after the policy change revealed a drastic reduction in local logging activities for households at all income levels. Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) subsequently became more important to household cash incomes. However, only some households were able to shift to a more intensive and far-ranging pattern of NTFP harvest, particularly households with boats and motors. Others lost income from both logging and NTFP extraction because for many households, these income sources were interdependent. An increasing Gini coefficient signals potentially escalating household income inequality. Key lessons for biodiversity and forest-carbon interventions in tropical forests include 1) regulations designed to control large-scale extraction can lead to unnecessarily restricted access for small-scale extractors, and 2) potential shifts in extractive pressure should be taken into account when access to forest resources is curtailed.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a perspective on why and how food rescue occurs in Australia. It also examines food rescue as a potential evolution within the emergency food setting. Design/methodology/approach - A descriptive study of SecondBite, an Australian food rescue organisation, was conducted. Documents were reviewed, 14 weeks of participant observation occurred, and two focus group discussions were held. Framing analysis was used to design the research questions (why rescue food? and how?). The description of the organisation was then examined against critical literature to establish how food rescue conforms to and/or challenges the traditional limitations of emergency food. Findings - Food rescue requires multiple resources within the emergency food space including surplus food, funding and labour. The frames used to justify this work provide an insight into the problem of food poverty in Australia and the solution of food rescue. The script for people in need requiring fresh food is well developed by SecondBite, with some tension around food waste reduction as a competing and yet complementary mission. Originality/value - In light of the growing role of the not for profit sector in a big society political order, the rescuing of nutritious food for emergency parcels and meals, may provide some benefits for people already using emergency food.

These issues are addressed within the context of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an emergent tourism market in Western Balkans. Design/methodology/approach - The research is exploratory. The city of Sarajevo was chosen as a study setting. Image of local cuisine was measured by using a multi-attribute approach in which several food attributes are specified and incorporated into the measurement instrument. Data from convenience sample of foreign tourists (n = 402) were quantitatively analyzed using multivariate and descriptive statistics. Findings - Results suggest that the local cuisine image compromises four components (dimensions): food uniqueness and cultural heritage, food quality and price, nutrition and health benefits of food and affective image of food. Furthermore, findings show that these dimensions differ in terms of their relative importance in explaining the overall tourist satisfaction with food experience. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this study is related to the geographical area (tourist site) where the research process was carried out. Thus, future research with greater geographical scope is required. Practical implications - This study provides valuable insight to practitioners who are seeking to integrate local food (cuisine) into the tourism product. Originality/value - This paper is the one of the first study that tries to identify perceived image of local cuisine held by visitors in Bosnia and Herzegovina.","[Pestek, Almir] Univ Sarajevo, SEBS, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,,merima.cinjarevic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Činjarević, Merima/H-5915-2019; Zhou, Yu/HTN-8810-2023; Pestek, Almir/AAJ-7437-2020","Pestek, Almir/0000-0001-5958-4993; Cinjarevic, Merima/0000-0002-1751-8311",,,,,47,64,67,1,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Fermented foods play an important socio-economic role in developing countries as well as making a major contribution to the nutrition requirements of natural populations. These foods have attracted attention all over the world as foods that might promote longevity. The approach is based on observations of online research with respect to fermented foods and their origins, analysis of research papers in journals and systematic research on the microbiology and health benefits of fermented products. Findings - In general, traditional fermented foods produced with indigenous practices throughout the world are made under primitive conditions, which result in low yield and poor quality. But since, these foods are not only traditional but also functional foods. They are experiencing a burst of popularity as health foods worldwide. The raw materials traditionally used for fermentation are as diverse as: fruits, cereals, vegetables, milk, meat, and fish. It is possible to obtain a large variety of different food products by selecting different raw materials, starter cultures, and fermentation conditions. Originality/value - The paper offers a holistic view that would guide a reader to identify various fermented products and enlighten them about their therapeutic properties.","[Soni, Surabhi] Jaypee Univ Informat Technol, Dept Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Solan, India; [Dey, Gargi] Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India",Jaypee University of Information Technology; Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT),"Dey, G (通讯作者)，Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.",drgargi.dey@gmail.com,"SONI, SURABHI/JLM-0818-2023; SONI, SURABHI/AAB-7707-2021","SONI, SURABHI/0000-0001-7996-212X; Dey, Gargi/0000-0002-1836-2101",,,,,71,20,22,14,122,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A linear regression model and a Markov switching autoregressive model is used, that incorporates a retailing demand process to capture a nonlinear structure among promotional budget allocation, and evaluate promotional performance, and optimal promotional frequency within a given time span. Three product categories are applied with 39 months of time-series data from a multinational packaged food company in Taiwan. Findings - The result shows that most previous decisions on promotional budget allocation are non-optimal - most promotional investments were either extended too long or allocated too low in stimulating sales. Research limitations/implications - This study suggests implications for the brand or category manager in removing such non-optimal promotional policies. Originality/value - Previous promotional investment is evaluated by comparing the changes in promotional budget allocation. Markov's switching feedback rules are then applied to determine the proper length of equilibrium state with and/or without promotion. Finally, effective decision rules on magnitude, duration, and frequency of intra-category promotional strategy are induced.","[Tang, Ying-Chan; Wang, Yu-Mei; Huang, Jiun-Yan] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Taipei, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Wang, YM (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",yumei.bm93g@nctu.edu.tw,,,,,,,30,6,6,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Product development cooperation, procurement, consumption, and prices are illustrated. Achieved local, social and environmental benefits are depicted. Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical framework includes the EU's strategy for corporate social responsibility concerning public procurement. Recent research on LOF and its procurement are summarized. The sources for empirical data included web pages depicting the case town and an interviewee, namely the food service manager. Findings - The results indicated that in 2011 local food products amounted to 46 per cent, whereas organic food products accounted for 14 per cent of the food procurement in the case town school's catering. The percentage of local food products in the whole town's catering amounted to 13. Benefits for the local community included money supporting the local economy, which thus facilitated the producers developing their businesses. However, higher prices were paid. Social benefits entailed that LOF contains the least amount of additives possible and LOF also advocates local food culture. Environmental benefits included, e.g. the following aspects: protecting the natural environment; decreasing packaging and bio waste; and diminished consuming water and energy. Practical implications - Increasing consumption of LOF required the following actions: integrating LOF into the town's strategy; allocating extra resources; training catering personnel; developing products with producers; and organising local procurement procedures. Originality/value - The results offer ideas for small municipalities how to increase the consumption of LOF gradually, and thus achieve benefits for the local community. The results may interest also those selling-in to that market sector.","[Tikkanen, Irma] Laurea Univ Appl Sci, Espoo, Finland; [Tikkanen, Irma] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Business, Kuopio, Finland",Laurea University of Applied Sciences; University of Eastern Finland,"Tikkanen, I (通讯作者)，Laurea Univ Appl Sci, Espoo, Finland.",irma.fikkanen@taloverkot.fi,,,,,,,38,8,8,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This analysis may necessitate the use of a simultaneous equations model with discrete and continuous endogenous variables as explanatory variables. In this paper, we offer an error augmentation approach to Hierarchical Bayesian estimation of a simultaneous bivariate probit model containing both discrete and continuous endogenous variables. We accomplish the error augmentation in our MCMC algorithm using a Metropolis-Hastings step that generates the error components of the latent variables in our model. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our error augmentation algorithm recovers closely the true parameters of the simultaneous bivariate probit model. We then apply our algorithm to customer churn data from a wireless service provider. We formulate a simultaneous bivariate probit model to study the impact of a customer's multiple product relationships with a firm (multi-buying) on the likelihood of churn by that customer. The empirical results show that the act of multi-buying significantly reduces churn even though the customers who are more predisposed to multi-buy have an inherently higher predisposition to churn.","[Balachander, Subramanian] Purdue Univ, Krannert Grad Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ghosh, Bikram] Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Balachander, S (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Grad Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sbalacha@purdue.edu; bghosh@moore.sc.edu,,,,,,,30,1,3,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

First, profits in a quota system increase when pride in the weaker territory or disappointment in the stronger territory increase. In a sales contest, by contrast, feelings of disappointment reduce profits regardless of territory characteristics. Second, a simultaneous strengthening of pride and disappointment enhances the advantage of quota over contest created by territory imbalance. However, the interpersonal nature of the contest, pitting a salesperson against a known rival, may generate stronger emotions than a quota-system, with its impersonal sales targets. So, third, a contest may overcome the profit advantages of the quota-system. Fourth, if pride and disappointment are strongly felt because of territory imbalance, handicapping either contest or quota is unprofitable, and moreover, if pride and disappointment are greater in interpersonal situations, handicapping may be more detrimental to a contest than to a sales quota-system.","[Yang, Ying; Syam, Niladri B.; Hess, James D.] Univ Houston, Dept Mkt & Entrepreneurship, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Hess, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Dept Mkt & Entrepreneurship, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",yyang24@uh.edu; nbsyam@uh.edu; jhess@uh.edu,,,,,,,31,5,6,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Using this decomposition, we provide new findings on the causes of polarization (the emergence of bimodality) and divergence (increased variance) of the world productivity distribution. First, unlike earlier studies, we find that efficiency change is the unique driver of the emergence of a second (higher) mode. Second, while earlier studies attributed the overall change in the distribution exclusively to physical capital accumulation, we find that technological change and human capital accumulation are also significant factors explaining this change in the distribution (most notably the emergence of a long right-hand tail). Robustness exercises indicate that these revisions of earlier findings are attributable to the addition of (more recent) years and a much greater number of countries included in our sample. We also check to see whether our results are changed by a correction for the downward bias in the DEA construction of the frontier, concluding that these corrections affect none of our major findings (essentially because the level correction roughly washes out in changes.).","[Badunenko, Oleg] Univ Cologne, Cologne Grad Sch Management Econ & Social Sci, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Henderson, Daniel J.] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Russell, R.

As the trade expands it influences both product and factor prices and if the distortions arise due to these market imperfections are not eliminated, the usual estimate of total factor productivity growth, using the growth accounting method, would be misleading. Theoretically, it shows that the usual estimate tends to be overestimated in the export competing sector and underestimated in the import competing sector. A modified approach of Olley-Pakes and Levinsohn-Petrin methods involving three-digits industries over the fifteen major Indian states during the period 1998-2005 has been used to deal with the simultaneity issue of factor choice and market distortions for the better estimate. A positive and significant impact of openness on the productivity growth has been observed only when the market imperfections are eliminated. Moreover, the modified productivity growth, after controlling market imperfections, has turned out to be lower than that of the usual estimate in India.","[Maiti, Dibyendu] Univ S Pacific, Sch Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Suva, Fiji; [Maiti, Dibyendu] Univ Delhi, Inst Econ Growth, New Delhi, India",University of the South Pacific; University of Delhi,"Maiti, D (通讯作者)，Univ S Pacific, Sch Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Suva, Fiji.",mdibyendu@yahoo.com,,"Maiti, Dibyendu/0000-0003-4187-7047",,,,,33,8,9,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The transition discourse points to solving the problem of sharing the cost of mitigating climate change through a process of global low-carbon growth. The vulnerability discourse focuses on the urgency of ambitious actions by all parties.

Corn ethanol dominates the market and penetration of cellulosic ethanol is unlikely in the near term due to economic and technical barriers. This paper uses game theory to model biomass and ethanol production decisions and calculate the incentives that would be necessary to drive the industry to obtain the cellulosic ethanol goals. After identifying the desired performance of a cellulosic ethanol supply chain, a nonlinear optimization model is developed to analyze two major scenarios that estimate conservative and optimistic technological improvements in cellulosic biomass and ethanol production. A potential carbon market is explored to determine its efficacy as an incentive mechanism. Results indicate that a carbon market would only be sufficient to incentivize a cellulosic ethanol industry under the optimistic improvement scenario with the highest switchgrass price. For all other scenarios, the carbon price needed to incentivize the industry would exceed the reasonable range and additional incentives would be needed to achieve the production goals of the Renewable Fuel Standard.

Using the dataset of the 18 EU countries over 1970-2004, we find that both import and FDI are significant factors in spreading efficiency externalities and thus accelerating technology catch-up in the EU. In particular, the impacts of the import are more prominent in the short-run while those of FDI play a more important role over the longer-run. Furthermore, the impacts of the import are pro-cyclical only in the short-run whereas those of FDI are pro-cyclical mostly over the medium- to the long-run. This evidence is broadly consistent with the sample observation that the recent slowdown of the EU productivity has been closely related to the corresponding FDI decline especially after 2000. Hence, any protection-oriented policy will be likely to be more detrimental for the EU.","[Camilla, Mastromarco] Univ Lecce, Dept Management & Econ, CESIfo, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Camilla, Mastromarco] RCEA, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Serlenga, Laura] Univ Bari, Dept Econ, IZA, I-70124 Bari, Italy; [Shin, Yongcheol] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Salento; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of York - UK,"Camilla, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lecce, Dept Management & Econ, CESIfo, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",camilla.mastromarco@unisalento.it; laura.serlenga@uniba.it; yongcheol.shin@york.ac.uk,"; Mastromarco, Camilla/N-4749-2015","SERLENGA, LAURA/0000-0002-7987-4880; Mastromarco, Camilla/0000-0003-4094-6549",,,,,62,14,19,0,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In so doing, we test how the typology and operation of terminals and the level of scale efficiency that a terminal can achieve, represent significant factors in the development and growth of the container terminal industry. The analysis is based on the assessment of 165 container terminals worldwide. We develop the estimation through the application of stochastic frontier analysis. We demonstrate that container terminals are more efficient than multi-purpose terminals, and that, compared with local operators, global terminal operators do not have a dominant position in international maritime trade in terms of productivity and efficiency. However, global terminal operators appear to be more dominant than local operators when we examine the Mediterranean Basin. In the final part of the paper we suggest how resource-constrained container terminals may improve their scale efficiency and identify general strategies related to container terminal investments.","[Medda, Francesca] UCL, UCL QASER Lab, London, England; [Liu, Qianwen] Drewry Shipping Consultants, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Medda, F (通讯作者)，UCL, UCL QASER Lab, Gower St, London, England.",f.medda@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,60,11,11,4,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

To investigate the environmental impacts of this trend, this study aimed to develop an Integrated Life Cycle Assessment and Environmental Input-Output Model (LCA-EIO Model). Using the tri-scope carbon footprint (CF) accounting method, the agricultural carbon footprint of Zhejiang Province, China was calculated for the years from 1997 to 2007, and the categories and structure of carbon emissions sources were analyzed, including patterns of change. In addition, the carbon intensity of crop farming in Zhejiang Province was examined. While an overall reduction in cropland areas has resulted in a substantial decline in direct greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production, the proportion of carbon emissions caused by energy and chemical consumption has increased dramatically, and this consumption has become the primary source of carbon emissions. A decomposition analysis also identified the key driving forces of energy-related CF dynamics, such as the machinery-labor substitution effect. The results of the decomposition analysis can support decision makers in understanding and promoting low-carbon output agriculture. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator accounts for potential multiple Nash equilibria. I apply the method to study the subscription decisions for cellular phone service in Taiwan. On average, a consumer's probability of subscribing to cellular service rises 13 percentage points when the other household member chooses to subscribe, suggesting the existence of intra-household network effects. Moreover, the intra-household effect is heterogeneous among households. It increases in household income, but decreases in the number of children and the age difference within a household.

Evolutionary economics provides a more realistic account of individual behavior underlying economic processes. It offers a framework for studying complex socio-economic interactions and exploring their properties. As a consequence, it may offer a better approach for the analysis of policies aimed at inducing fundamental changes in behaviors, technologies and institutions in the direction of increased sustainability. However, a coherent evolutionary-economic approach to economic policies has been missing so far. In particular, policy criteria for evaluating evolutionary outcomes and processes are ambiguous.

One major point of critique is that total economic value bases the monetary value of ecosystems purely on the flow of human benefits of services of ecosystems and consequently ignores questions of sustainable use of natural capital per se. This paper explains why total economic value by itself is in principle an inadequate concept to guide sustainable use of ecosystems and gives an overview of essential ecological theory that needs to be taken into account in addition to total economic value to fully include ecosystem sustainability. The paper concludes with a framework for combining ecological theory with economic valuation. The key elements here are theoretical ecological insights about ecosystem resilience and portfolio theory which offers an economic perspective on investment in biodiversity. Portfolio theory puts total economic value in a framework where investment in biodiversity is expanded to cover functional diversity and mobile link species in order to maintain ecosystem resilience and so fosters sustainable use of ecosystems.

Health spending has a significant effect on reducing infant and under-5 child mortality with an elasticity of 0.13 to 0.33 for infant mortality and 0.15 to 0.38 for under-5 child mortality in models estimated using fixed effects methods (depending on models employed). Government health spending also has a significant effect on reducing infant and child mortality and the size of the coefficient depends on the level of good governance achieved by the country, indicating that good governance increases the effectiveness of health spending. This paper contributes to the new evidence pointing to the importance of investing in health care services and the importance of governance in improving health outcomes.","[Farag, Marwa] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Publ Hlth, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Nandakumar, A.

A poor cotton harvest depressed export revenues and reduced international demand for American assets, which depressed American stock prices, drained deposits from money center banks and precipitated a business cycle downturn-conditions that bred financial crises.

Over previous decades there has been a significant increase in the number of immigrant enclaves, where immigrants account for a substantial fraction of the local population. Using both recorded crime and self-reported crime victimization data, we find that crime is significantly lower in those neighborhoods with sizeable immigrant population shares. The effect is nonlinear and only becomes significant in enclaves. The crime reducing effect is substantially enhanced if the enclave is composed of immigrants from the same ethnic background.

Decoupling of cities from ecological systems can only occur locally and partially, thanks to the appropriation of vast areas of ecosystem services provision beyond the city boundaries. Conserving and restoring ecosystem services in urban areas can reduce the ecological footprints and the ecological debts of cities while enhancing resilience, health, and quality of life for their inhabitants. In this paper we synthesize knowledge and methods to classify and value ecosystem services for urban planning. First, we categorize important ecosystem services and disservices in urban areas. Second, we describe valuation languages (economic costs, socio-cultural values, resilience) that capture distinct value dimensions of urban ecosystem services. Third, we identify analytical challenges for valuation to inform urban planning in the face of high heterogeneity and fragmentation characterizing urban ecosystems. The paper discusses various ways through which urban ecosystems services can enhance resilience and quality of life in cities and identifies a range of economic costs and socio-cultural impacts that can derive from their loss. We conclude by identifying knowledge gaps and challenges for the research agenda on ecosystem services provided in urban areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Three types of grasslands were selected, which include alpine meadow (QH-1), alpine steppe meadow (QH-2) and alpine steppe (QH-3), and the soil erosion rate was taken as the index to measure soil conservation function. The experimental results show that the soil erosion rates of three grassland samples increase with wind velocity under different treatments but the increment of erosion rate varied greatly. Under original status, soil erosion rates are in turn QH-1QH-2>QH-3. When the aboveground vegetation was cut, the soil erosion rate change of QH-1 is the same as that of QH-3 and compared with the original status both of them changed a little. And when the root system was destroyed the erosion rates range in turn as QH-1QH-2>QH-3. The economic values of soil conservation were estimated, which include the values of organic carbon fixation, nutrient retention and reducing soil disuse. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - A consumer survey was carried out in Thessaloniki (Greece) and 337 self-reported questionnaires from tomato consumers were used in the analysis. The major consumer segments are illustrated and interventions to promote tomato consumption are suggested. Findings - The findings from principal component analysis indicate that the main factors that influence consumption of fresh tomatoes are: nutrition value, organoleptic characteristics of tomatoes and eating habits of consumers. A two-step cluster analysis revealed three segments of tomato consumers labelled as Tomato-loyals, Sensorialists and Health-conscious. Practical implications - The findings reveal the consumption characteristics of each consumer segment where tailored social marketing plans can be developed based on this work. The findings will be of interest to food marketers and food policy makers, as they can contribute to addressing obesity problems in Europe in general and Mediterranean countries in particular. Originality/value - The paper identifies the underlying reasons for eating fresh tomatoes, which can lead to the adoption of a healthy diet and can support policies towards that. It also reveals new consumer segments and highlights differences between them. In addition, it highlights the interventions to increase tomato consumption of each segment. Finally, it employs a cluster analysis technique, two-step cluster analysis, which has not been widely used in marketing research.","[Alamanos, Eleftherios] Lincoln Univ, Sch Business, Lincoln, England; [Bourlakis, Michael] Brunel Univ, Sch Business, London, England; [Tzimitra-Kalogianni, Irini] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Lincoln; Brunel University; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Alamanos, E (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Sch Business, Lincoln, England.",ealamanos@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Bourlakis, Michael/0000-0001-5093-5398; Alamanos, Eleftherios/0000-0003-4294-458X",,,,,57,14,15,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This preliminary study aims to investigate value-added agriculture, including the extent to which food growers consider, or are involved in, this aspect of multifunctional agriculture, from the perspective of orchard operators located in different Australian states. Design/methodology/approach - Orchard operators were contacted through regional growers' associations and by mail. A total of 80, the large majority of whom are small orchardists, participated in the study, completing a questionnaire designed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. Findings - Overall, there is moderate interest among the participating orchard operators in adding value to food production. Respondents also indicate barriers in the form of added expenses, lack of time, knowledge, and markets, to sell value-added products. Research limitations/implications - This study has only provided preliminary data from a limited number of participants; future research could broaden the scope to gather the insights of more orchard operators or even study other rural food-growing sectors. Practical implications - With increasing pressures on the farmland, the findings have several implications, in particular, the need to understand the cost-benefits involved in value adding activities and potential cost-savings strategies. Originality/value - In the case of Australian agriculture, little has been discussed about the extent to which value-added food production is being considered among food growers, for instance, using commercial kitchens to process foods that do not sell as premium. The present study examines this unexplored dimension and seeks to provide useful preliminary information.","[Alonso, Abel Duarte] Edith Cowan Univ, Dept Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, WA, Australia; [Northcote, Jeremy] Murdoch Univ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Perth, WA, Australia",Edith Cowan University; Murdoch University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Dept Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, WA, Australia.",a.duartealonso@uws.edu.au,"Northcote, Jeremy/JKI-7885-2023","Northcote, Jeremy/0000-0002-4136-2097",,,,,64,16,18,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This is a comparative study involving Muslim consumers in Malaysia and The Netherlands. Cross-sectional data were collected through a survey with 251 Muslims in Malaysia and 250 Muslims in The Netherlands. Data were analysed by means of nonparametric tests. Findings - There is a preferred higher level of segregation in a Muslim country than a non-Muslim country. A Muslim country has a higher willingness to pay for a halal logistics system as compared to a non-Muslim country. Furthermore, there lies a heavy responsibility with the manufacturer to extend halal assurance towards supply chain management. Research limitations/implications - The study confirms there is a need for a different level of segregation and therefore different halal logistics standard in a Muslim country and a non-Muslim country. However, during the survey in The Netherlands significant rejections were received from especially first generation Muslims due to the lack of understanding of the Dutch language. Similar surveys need to be conducted in other countries in order to be able to generalise over the various Islamic schools of thought, local fatwas and local customs. Practical implications - Halal logistics is important to the Muslim consumer and critical for the trust in a halal certified brand, which requires extending halal integrity from point of production to the point of consumer purchase. Originality/value - This study is a preliminary one investigating the consumer perception on halal logistics. The study indicates the level of segregation required for a halal meat supply chain in a Muslim and non-Muslim country.","[Tieman, Marco] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Ghazali, Maznah Che] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Dept Mkt, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [van der Vorst, Jack G.

The accumulation of knowledge arises from complex and dynamic interactions between a firm's own internal capacity and external expertise. Research and development (R&D) remains important in the innovation process, but it must be integrated with knowledge from other sources, such as training and knowledge capitalization. This paper investigates the relationship between such knowledge sources and the productivity of French firms. Using asymptotic least squares, a Cobb-Douglas function including R&D, innovation, training expenditure and ISO 9000 certification is estimated for 1,213 French manufacturing firms. Our results show that innovation, training and ISO 9000 certification have a positive and significant impact on firms' productivity.","[Legros, Diego] Lab Econ & Gest, F-21066 Dijon, France; [Galia, Fabrice] Res Ctr Enterprises, Dept Org Management & Entrepreneurship, Grp ESC Dijon Bourgogne Burgundy, Sch Business,CEREN, F-21006 Dijon, France",Universite de Bourgogne,"Legros, D (通讯作者)，Lab Econ & Gest, 2 Blvd Gabriel,BP 26611, F-21066 Dijon, France.",diego.legros@u-bourgogne.fr,,"GALIA, Fabrice/0000-0002-0491-6687",,,,,41,19,23,0,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This article estimates trends in the percentage of the agricultural day-labouring workforce that were children. By using the wage level to identify child workers, it is possible to estimate child labour for a large sample of English farms. It is found that girls were rarely employed as day-labourers, while boys were employed about as frequently as women. The percentage of boys in the day-labour workforce increased until the 1820s and then declined.","Wabash Coll, Crawfordsville, IN 47933 USA",,"Burnette, J (通讯作者)，Wabash Coll, Crawfordsville, IN 47933 USA.",,,,,,,,36,7,8,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Results indicate controlling for hypothetical bias makes the two samples, residents of Baengnyeong Island (where the spotted seal is located) and the general South Korea population, more similar than if bias is not corrected. Without correcting for bias, for example, residents' willingness-to-pay for preservation of the seal is 33% higher than the general population; however, after controlling for hypothetical bias this percent decreases to 21%.

By inserting software switches to turn individual features on and off, we obtain FUND's estimates for 15 categories of damages, and for components of the agricultural category. FUND, as used by the U.S. government to estimate the social cost of carbon, projects a net benefit of climate change in agriculture, offset by a slightly larger estimate of all other damages. Within agriculture there is a large benefit from CO2 fertilization, a moderate cost from the effect of temperature on yields, and a much smaller impact of the rate of change. In FUND'S agricultural modeling, the temperature-yield equation comes close to dividing by zero for high-probability values of a Monte Carlo parameter. The range of variation of the optimal temperature exceeds physically plausible limits, with 95% confidence intervals extending to 17 degrees C above and below current temperatures. Moreover. FUND's agricultural estimates are calibrated to research published in 1996 or earlier. Use of estimates from such models is arguably inappropriate for setting public policy. But as long as such models are being used in the policymaking process, an update to reflect newer research and correct modeling errors is needed before FUND's damage estimates can be relied on.

Spatial econometrics usually solves these problems by deriving estimators assuming that functional forms are known and by using model comparison techniques to let the data choose between competing specifications. We argue that in many situations of interest this achieves, at best, only very weak identification. Worse, in many cases, such an approach will be uninformative about the causal economic processes at work, rendering much applied spatial econometric research pointless, unless the main aim is description of the data.

Yet knowledge of the financial viability and impact of community-based forest enterprises (CFEs) is lacking. This study evaluates the profitability of three CFEs in the Brazilian Amazon: Ambe, an industrial-scale, upland forest operation producing logs in a national forest, in Pars state; ACAF, a small-scale operation in flooded forests producing boards with a portable sawmill in Amazonas state; and Mamiraua, one of 30 CFEs in a reserve in Amazonas state producing logs and boards in flooded forests. Costs for each CFE were compiled by forest management activity and cost type. Annual total costs were calculated as the sum of fixed and variable costs and then subtracted from total revenue to obtain annual profit. The annual rate of return on investment was calculated by dividing profits by total costs. The Ambe and Mamiraua cases were profitable, demonstrating rates of return of approximately 12% and 2%, respectively; the ACAF case was not profitable. This study illustrates the benefits of cost-sharing among CFEs, and the potential return for investments in small and large-scale community forestry. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We map out the prevailing epistemological orientation of social learning research through the de-construction of the methodological choices reported in current social learning literature. Based on an analysis of 54 empirical investigations of social learning and natural resources published after peer review, we investigated aspects of research design that include data collection methods, evidence types and the researcher's role. We consider these against different research-orientations (positivist, interpretive, critical, and post-normal). We discuss which research-orientation appears most congruent with the overall commitment and premises of social learning studies. In line with initial expectations this study shows that positivist stances are hardly present, however research that follows a postnormal approach is less frequent than initially assumed. Instead, findings suggest that researchers using a social learning perspective to study resource issues tend to choose methodologies that allow for in-depth descriptions, for meaning making and enquiry as a form of action.

Little is known, however, about the extent to which negotiation behaviour in fact shapes outcomes. This paper addresses that question, building on data from the Miles et al. (Environmental regime effectiveness: confronting theory with evidence. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2002) environmental regimes project. Four main conclusions can be inferred from the analysis. First, the Miles et al. core model seems to account for a fair amount of the variance observed in the strategies adopted by pushers and laggards, but it also leaves ample scope for other explanations. Second, both of these groups respond to the choice of strategy made by the other. Third, adding negotiation strategies to the Miles et al. core model does not significantly change the conclusions obtained from that model itself. Finally, sometimes negotiation strategies-in particular combinations of strategies-nevertheless make a real difference, often through interplay with other factors. To better understand when and how this occurs, we need models that are more sophisticated and a combination of methodological tools designed for aggregating as well as separating effects.","Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Underdal, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, POB 1097, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",arild.underdal@stv.uio.no,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The Consolidacion de los Vales Reales (1804-1809), an endorsement of the debt contracted to its colonies by Spain in order to finance its constant wars, caused the collapse of the Mexican Treasury and was a key factor in its independence. This article demonstrates that in Cuba, the Consolidation had a different effect. Thanks to its different institutionalization and fiscal praxis, it was used to alleviate the deficit of situados, with which the Mexican Treasury financed the Cuban, and it may help to understand the reasons for non-independence. However, to prove this requires reconstructing the accounts of the Cuban Consolidation, which also demonstrates that the data used up until now were erroneous.","[Vazquez Cienfuegos, Sigfrido; Santamaria Garcia, Antonio] CSIC, Escuela Estudios Hispano Amer, Seville 41002, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Escuela de Estudios Hispano-Americanos (EEHA),"Cienfuegos, SV (通讯作者)，CSIC, Escuela Estudios Hispano Amer, C Alfonso XII 16, Seville 41002, Spain.",a_santamaria_garcia@yahoo.es; svazquez@eehaa.csic.es,"Santamaria, Antonio/K-5793-2014",,,,,,45,2,2,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Food consumption data from 1918 adults participating in the French national dietary survey and GHGE of 73 highly consumed foods (in g CO(2)e/100 g of edible food) were used to estimate the GHGE of each individual diet. The mean dietassociated GHGE was 4170 g CO(2)e/day and a high inter-individual variability was observed. When the total caloric intakes were reduced to meet the individual energy needs, the diet-associated GHGE decreased by either 10.7% or 2.4%, depending on the assumption made on the average physical activity level of the population. The meat and deli meat food group represented the strongest diet-associated GHGE contributor, but the impact of different meat reduction scenarios was modest. In particular, when fruit and vegetables were isocalorically substituted for meat, either null or even positive diet-associated GHGE variations were observed because the needed amounts of fruit and vegetables to maintain the caloric content of the diet were high. Therefore, substituting fruit and vegetables for meat (especially deli meat) may be desirable for health but is not necessarily the best approach to decreasing diet-associated GHGE.

Patent counts were used as proxy for innovation and assessed market variables include ethanol consumption and price, and gasoline price. The study refers to the period 1975-2008. Empirical evidence is formulated with an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model for cointegration and the causality is examined with a multivariate Granger causality test. The results demonstrate a potential causal relation between ethanol innovation and ethanol consumption, evidencing a unidirectional relation from ethanol consumption to patent registers in the studied period. Such a relation indicates that increments in ethanol consumption can potentially stimulate innovation in the sector. Moreover, the ethanol price and the cross-effect of gasoline price have an indirect effect on ethanol innovation. Several questions are raised regarding the yet to be determined factors driving innovation in the sector. Further studies focused on nonmarket aspects, including policy factors, subsidies and international technology spillovers, would potentially elucidate several unanswered questions concerning ethanol innovation in Brazil.

More significantly, it demonstrates that Gras's failure to examine the capital's grain trade other than in terms of aggregate corn imports has disguised the nature and extent of its contribution to the development of the London economy. By the 1680s, the coastal trade comprised two distinct strands of roughly equal size: one providing food and drink for the London population, the other fuelling the overland trade of the capital. It is argued that the former was unnecessary for the provision of the city other than in barren years, but that the latter may have been indispensable for the development of the overland transport infrastructure of the metropolitan region at the height of the late seventeenth-century commercial revolution. Thanks largely to the agency of southern English mariners commanding large coasters, London's demand for fodder crops after the mid-1670s drew most of the coast stretching from Berwick to Whitehaven into the orbit of the metropolitan corn market.","Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Canterbury, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Hipkin, S (通讯作者)，Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Canterbury, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,45,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Part 1 of this survey shows that, in terms of equity, Tradable Energy Quotas (TEQs) - a widely discussed personal carbon trading (PCT) scheme - cannot be differentiated from Cap and Dividend (C&D) or Cap and Share (C&S). Hence, Part 2 explores whether they can be differentiated in terms of efficiency and/or effectiveness. The paper reviews two studies that compare the efficiency of TEQs and C&D. Whilst their estimates of the costs and abatement potential of TEQs differ, neither study considers that there is a case, on efficiency grounds, for its implementation. The paper goes on to sketch two arguments for the implementation of PCT that might, nevertheless, be made on efficiency grounds and one - relating to public acceptability that might be made on effectiveness grounds. Exploring the various public surveys conducted on the acceptability of PCT, the paper concludes that support for PCT is not obviously greater than for alternative instruments and notes a methodological limitation in the work reviewed. The paper concludes that, to date, the case against implementation of PCT is stronger than the case for. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Explosion severity was gained by using Siwek 20 L vessel and factors strongly influencing inerting effectiveness, such as deflagration mechanism and inertant composition were taken into account. Tests of thermal-gravimetric analysis were conducted to identify the reaction mechanism of coal dust explosions. As a result, bituminous coal dust deflagrates via the homogeneous mechanism, while anthracite dust mainly features the mechanism of heterogeneous reaction. Results reveal that the inerting functional mechanisms are quite different for bituminous coal and anthracite dusts, and the homogeneous-combustion-dust is much easier to be inhibited than the heterogeneous-reaction-dust. Trends of higher inerting effectiveness are associated with better decomposability, more excellent performance of oxygen blocking. Moreover, the particular efficacy of free ammonia decomposed from monoammonium phosphate in flame extinguishing is identified. Added water shows the best inerting effectives due to particle aggregation induced by moisture, which gives the idea that humidification for coal dust is therefore a cost-effective approach for explosion prevention and mitigation.

The paper also seeks to highlight focal points for development. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 46 structured telephone interviews with stakeholders within the food system were carried out during 2006 in the Nordic countries. The theoretical frame was established by Billig's idea of ideological dilemmas and the interview transcripts were coded into conceptual versus pragmatic speech regarding catering for sustainability. Thereafter, five subcategories were topically identified in each category representing variation in meanings. Findings - Sustainable catering as conceptually understood corresponds to a holistic picture while the pragmatic view represents more everyday working orientation. The analysis delivered five topical categories of conceptual and pragmatic sustainability, which show how sustainability was dealt with in speech by mixing the conceptual ideal with the pragmatic on the shop floor, while evidently there seemed to be conceptualisations which do not have their proper counterpart within pragmatic action. The way sustainability was viewed suggests a translation of ideology into practice and to do that proper tools and support are needed, both within own activities and in the linking with other stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - The participants represented progressive stakeholders as they were members of a Nordic network for healthy and sustainable catering. Originality/value - The study includes progressive professional stakeholders in different positions within the food system. A system approach is used to better locate differences and similarities in understanding the concept and its translational potential within the food system.","[Post, Anna] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Food & Nutr & Sport Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Mikkola, Minna] Univ Helsinki, Ruralia Inst, Mikkeli, Finland",University of Gothenburg; University of Helsinki,"Post, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Food & Nutr & Sport Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",Anna.post@ped.gu.se,,,Nordic Innovation Centre (NICe) through the Network for Nordic Excellence in Healthy and Sustainable Catering; Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as part of the iPOPY research project (innovative Public Organic food Procurement for Youth),Nordic Innovation Centre (NICe) through the Network for Nordic Excellence in Healthy and Sustainable Catering; Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as part of the iPOPY research project (innovative Public Organic food Procurement for Youth),"The empirical part of this study has been funded by Nordic Innovation Centre (NICe) through the Network for Nordic Excellence in Healthy and Sustainable Catering during 2005-2007.

It aims to provide a stimulus for thinking food problems through a simple formula Four Ss with one F for getting the full story at a glance. Design/methodology/approach - This descriptive paper is based on an extensive literature review as well as personal observations gained from previous studies. Findings - The three Ss, security or insecurity, safety, and sovereignty have been major topics in the public agenda for a long time as food-related problems. When the basic idea food for all is considered, these are not inclusive enough. The fourth concept can be described as shareability. These concepts are not competitive but complementary, even overlapping to some extent. Food sovereignty and shareability can be considered opposing concepts to the available free-market based approaches in the efforts to bring all people food security and food safety. This revision evidenced that despite the many efforts in this field for several decades, present free market oriented approaches have not led to solutions to the problem of food security and providing safe food to all people, i.e. food for all. Hunger does not result from a shortage in the food supply as generally argued. The food problem is related to poverty and the inability to purchase food. It is not possible to solve hunger and nutrition problems and maintain a permanent social peace without equality and justice in income distribution throughout the world in such a way that poor people have enough income to access vital basic food needs. Originality/value - This paper introduces a new concept in food science as shareability along with considering previous caacepts of food, security, safety and sovereignty, all together.","Www Ereconomics Com, Bursa, Turkey",,"Rehber, E (通讯作者)，Www Ereconomics Com, Bursa, Turkey.",rehber@uludag.edu.tr,,,,,,,59,7,10,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The first of three intended case studies of firms developing products at the drug-device interface, describes how a biotechnology start-up company managed to survive and grow by successfully aligning the required knowledge and capabilities to leverage the regulatory, financing and knowledge management issues. Through semi-structured interviews of four key stakeholders of the firm and archival data analysis, the evolution of the company's product development process and overall strategy is set against the constraints it faced, to identify how converging technologies were managed and how they leveraged or hampered efficiency of the product development process. Though further investigation is needed, the key success factors that seem to emerge are the internalisation of regulatory management, manufacturing process management and partnering management capabilities, a strong opportunistic mindset, and a positioning of the firm as a technology provider. These preliminary results suggest that contrary to practitioners' main belief, drug-device convergence can positively impact a firm's product development, at least at the start-up stage.","[Rortais, Florent] ESC Rennes Sch Business, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business,,frortais@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,16,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,963,972,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500090,0

The valuation scenario refers to the UK part of the Dogger Bank, in the southern North Sea, and is based on real-world management options for fisheries, wind farms and marine protection currently under discussion for the site. It is assessed to what extent the general public perceive and value conservation benefits arising from an offshore marine protected area. The survey reveals support for marine conservation measures despite the general public's limited prior knowledge of current marine planning.

We present a novel empirical analysis using interviews and Q Methodology to examine how conservation practitioners and organisations are interpreting and using ES concepts and associated approaches. We find that these concepts are being adopted for instrumental imperatives to broaden constituencies and with an expectation of extending funding sources. We uncover concerns within conservation that the utilitarian emphases of ES concepts may compromise the ability to make non-utilitarian arguments for nature in the future. In relation to changing practice, we examine shifts in partnerships and funding, where ES ideas provide a shared language about flows of value, apparently accelerating the integration of conservation and the private sector. Whilst many respondents noted the significance of shifts related to ES ideas, some attempted to play these down, presenting their organisation's adoption of these ideas as 'just a rhetorical tool'. However, we argue that the adoption of ES concepts cannot be presented as solely rhetorical, given that these increasingly underpin and inform planning tools and policy instruments.

The central hypothesis is that access to railway services provides the best-connected areas with a long-term comparative advantage over others that are less accessible. Carrying out a historical analysis and providing comparable data at the municipal level allows us to determine the extent to which the railway has fostered the concentration of population within its immediate surroundings. The case study presented here is that of Spain between 1900 and 2001, but the same methodology could equally be applied to any other country for which the required data are available. In this case, key data included a Geographic Information System with information about both the development of the railway network and census data relating to total population at the municipal level. The results obtained suggest the relevance of this methodology, which makes it possible to identify the periods and areas in which this influence was most significant.","[Franch-Auladell, Xavier; Morillas-Torne, Mateu; Marti-Henneberg, Jordi] Univ Lleida, Dept Geog & Sociol, Lleida 25003, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,"Franch-Auladell, X (通讯作者)，Univ Lleida, Dept Geog & Sociol, Victor Siurana Sq 1, Lleida 25003, Spain.",xfranch.ced@gmail.com; mmorillas@geosoc.udl.cat; marti.henneberg@geosoc.udl.cat,"Morillas-Torné, Mateu/B-6004-2014","Morillas-Torné, Mateu/0000-0001-6747-5471",,,,,27,6,7,1,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Theoretical models predict that hospitals have financial incentives to increase the quantity of treatments applied to patients. This is especially true for for-profit hospitals. If that's the case, it is important to examine whether the increase in treatment quantity is translated into better treatment outcomes. Our analyses take advantage of the National Health Insurance of Taiwan's implementation of global budgets for hospitals in 2002. Our data come from the National Health Insurance's claim records, covering the universe of hospitalized patients suffering acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke. Regression analyses are carried out separately for government, private not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals. We find that for-profit hospitals and private not-for-profit hospitals did increase their treatment intensity for cardio-cerebrovascular disease patients after the 2002 implementation of global budgets. However, this was not accompanied by an improvement in these patients' mortality rates. This reveals a waste of medical resources and implies that aggregate expenditure caps should be supplemented by other designs to prevent resources misallocation.","[Kan, Kamhon] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Kan, Kamhon; Tsai, Wei-Der] Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan 32054, Taiwan; [Li, Shu-Fen] Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Taichung 40601, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Central University; Central Taiwan University Science & Technology,"Kan, K (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",kk@sinica.edu.tw; sfli@ctust.edu.tw; twd@cc.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,40,15,15,0,63,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

We analyzed International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data from 2010 using structural equation modeling (SEM). Attitudes toward science were found to play a complex role in pro-environmental consumption. First, a positive general attitude toward science was indirectly associated with pro-environmental consumption through increased environmental concern and knowledge. Second, the belief that science makes pro-environmental behavior unnecessary was indirectly associated with the avoidance of pro-environmental consumption through reduced environmental concern and knowledge. When these indirect associations were taken into account, a positive general attitude toward science was directly associated with the avoidance of pro-environmental behavior, and the belief that science makes pro-environmental behavior unnecessary was directly associated with increased pro-environmental consumption. The associations between the main variables were similar in all Nordic countries. These results increase our understanding about the ways in which attitudes toward science are related to pro-environmental consumption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Revisiting oil boom-era investment and productivity in Nigeria's national accounts, 1976-85",ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Scholars have struggled to understand the role of investment in the slow growth of post-Independence sub-Saharan Africa. Existing research has largely relied on national accounting data, which suggests low returns on investment in the region. This article uses data gathered during fieldwork to investigate the quality of the investment data in the national accounts of Nigeria, Africa's most populous economy. It proposes a new investment series which can be compared to those in Nigeria's national accounts for 1976-85. It provides an alternative view of investment and productivity during the country's crucial oil boom period, when Nigeria had significant funding available for investment but this investment did not result in long-term economic growth. Data are drawn from construction surveys, publicly listed and privately held construction company financial records, and industry publications. The new series suggests that for many years of the oil boom, approximately two-thirds of what was recorded as having been investment in Nigeria's national accounts was not investment at all. Much of this was ghost construction', projects paid for but never completed. This indicates that actual investment was far more productive than has previously been appreciated.",,,,,,,,,,,35,5,6,1,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The analyses concentrate on the potential effects of newly discussed crops such as Jatropha curcas, cassava, and sugarcane on macro level. Thereby two aspects are neglected, the income effects on micro level, and the integration of traditional firewood production systems for comparison. To fill this gap, an Environmentally Extended Social Accounting Matrix (ESAM) at the village level is developed and applied to a rural village in Tanzania. The objective is first to explore the integration of agroforestry systems in rural smallholder systems and second to analyze income effects of agricultural biomass production for bioenergy purposes in comparison to firewood production. In order to distinguish the use of firewood from public and private tree resources, environmental accounts for changes in tree stocks (public and private) are included. Findings indicate the importance of including common firewood production as a reference point The highest income effect for the poorest households derives from agroforestiy, which households use as a source of firewood and fruits for sale or home consumption, followed by J. curcas, sugarcane and finally cassava. Agroforestry in general has been also found to substantially release the pressure on public forest reserves. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper develops an extension of the leakage discount formula in Murray et al. (2004) that incorporates changes in input (land) usage rather than product output (crop or forest product quantity). Additionally the leakage discount developed here allows for land conversion and production replacement involving multiple alternative uses. In an empirical application in the Southeast Texas we compute leakage discounts of 14.8% for the conversion of rice to no-till sorghum and 14.9% for rice to pasture program. Most of the sources of GHG offset leakage come from conversions of cotton to rice and pasture to rice in the other regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In Ireland they were almost wiped out by the early 1920s, while in the Netherlands they proved to be a long-lasting institutional transplant. Raiffeisen banks were successful in the Netherlands because they operated in niche markets with few competitors, while rural financial markets in Ireland were unsegmented and populated by long-established incumbents, leaving little room for new players, whatever their institutional advantages. Dutch Raiffeisen banks were largely self-financing, closely integrated into the wider rural economy, and able to take advantage of economic and religious divisions in rural society.

We find that the shift towards a service economy has contributed to lower overall energy intensity levels in the OECD, but this contribution would have been considerably larger if the service sector had realized the same degree of energy efficiency improvements as the manufacturing sector. In most OECD countries energy intensity levels in services tend to decrease relatively slow, especially after 1995. If we control this trend for the impact of structural changes within the services sector - by means of a decomposition analysis we find that in about one-third of the OECD countries, energy intensity levels in services have increased over time. The impact of structural changes on aggregate energy intensity dynamics in services has increased considerably after 1995, highlighting a relatively poor energy efficiency performance within a wide range of service sectors. We show that the introduction of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a potentially important role here. Using panel data regression analysis, we find a limited role for energy prices in explaining variation in energy productivity, while climate conditions clearly impact energy productivity.

The credibility of the debt, mostly in perpetual redeemable annuities, was enhanced by decentralized funding through taxes administered by cities making up the Realm in the Cortes. The accumulation of short-term debt depended on refinancing through long-term debt. Financial crises in the short-term debt occurred when the service of the long-term debt reached the revenues of its servicing taxes.

While blessed with rich groundwater resources in many parts of the country, Oman's agriculture is plagued with salinity, and most recently sea water intrusion due to excessive pumping in coastal regions, where the main agricultural land is located. In order to address this issue, monitoring and limiting groundwater use for agriculture has been proposed. While a significant amount of extension effort is under way with limited or no success, this paper is an attempt to study how groundwater irrigation could be made more efficient by applying modern technology, especially, sensor-based precision irrigation in Omani agricultural farms. Even though some farms in the Al Batinah region, the largest agricultural area in Oman, have modern irrigation systems installed, hardly any are automated. As such, the operation of various types of irrigation systems are done manually with little or no attention given to water saving. Since the traditional practice of farmers in the country is furrow (flooded) irrigation, the general tendency of them is to apply more water than required to create flooded irrigation conditions. Wherever irrigation controllers are used, the control mechanism has been based on the evapotranspiration (ET) method, which requires the whole water requirement per day to be applied at once and it is inevitable that the soil gets oversaturated causing higher levels of percolation and evaporation loss. In order to prevent this, a soil moisture-based approach is proposed. This paper presents two models developed based on standard relationships for estimating irrigation requirement using both these methods and a comparative analysis showing the application areas where the soil moisture-based method may provide more water saving. It could be seen that the soil moisture-based method saves water at certain soil moisture levels under different field capacities, especially when the ET-based method may incorrectly suggest unnecessarily high water application amounts due to other environmental conditions.","[Alahakoon, P.

In addition, the ratio of tangible assets and company size were analysed. Based on the analysis of a sample of 450 companies over the period from 2004 to 2012, it can be concluded that agriculture companies did not have volatile ROE in the period of the study, and during recession, this ratio still remained above 10%. Such situation can be explained by government policies and subsidies. Therefore, ROE of agriculture companies is not generally associated and correlated with other company characteristics. In the case of food production companies, one can find that during the recession more profitable companies have less debt (regardless of maturity). For retail companies, it can be concluded that bigger companies have a higher ROE, yet asset structure and long-term debt ratio are negatively correlated with ROE.","[Berzkalne, Irina; Zelgalve, Elvira] Latvian State Univ, LV-1063 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Berzkalne, I (通讯作者)，Latvian State Univ, Aspazijas Bulvaris 5, LV-1063 Riga, Latvia.",irina.berzkalne@inbox.lv; elzelg@lu.lv,,,,,,,13,5,7,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,94,103,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700010,0

Another 1.6 billion people, or almost one quarter of the world's population, face economic water shortage (FAO, 2012). In this paper, both water and energy use efficiency are investigated in a typical double span greenhouse for organic tomato production in Al-Ain city, United Arab Emirates. Four tomato breeds were transplanted in the greenhouse in the first week of December 2011 and the plants were removed from the greenhouse by the end of June 2012. Three-Watt meters were used to record the energy consumed by the irrigation pump, cooling pump and cooling fans, while two water flow meters were used to record water flow to the irrigation system and cooling pads separately. The evaporatively cooled greenhouse consumed 202.2, 10787.9, and 930.2 kWh to run the irrigation pump, fan, and cooling pump respectively. On the other hand, the amount of water used in this specific production season in this greenhouse was 837,662.6 and 615,052.8 L for cooling and irrigation respectively. It was concluded that cooling fans consumed about 90% of the electrical energy of the greenhouse while the cooling system consumed about 58% of the total amount of the water consumed in the production season.","[Fadel, M.

The purpose of this paper is to pinpoint the delicate issues involved in moving towards a trans-national, unified, consensual definition of the term junk food, including social, economic, cultural, nutritional and methodological problems. Design/methodology/approach - Departing from the work done by international bodies (WHO, FAO-Codex Alimentarius, OECD, EFSA and European Commission) authors descriptively investigate possible background elements able to frame the surrounding debate about junk food(nutrient profiles, labelling provisions, institutional aspects, etc.). Findings - Presently there is a lack of a global consensus and of scientific basis to define clearly what constitutes junk food either on regional areas or globally. Despite of good metrics able to classify foods according to their nutritional quality, policy making relies yet on the concept that only diets or single nutrients can be focused as good or bad. Practical implications - A junk food taxonomy could be helpful to harmonize trade policies in internal markets (i.e. the EU) and at global level; but also to gain a wider social support for hard policy measures intending to counteract non-communicable-diseases (NCDs), and more generally, obesity and overweight. Social implications - A clear basis for junk food definition could be the first step to introduce otherwise controversial and easily opposable public health policies and campaigns, due to private interests of the different stakeholders. Even consumers may perceive food policies (in the sake of food taxes or traffic light labelling) as unfair, whereas not robust scientific ground has been previously given at the highest possible level. Originality/value - The value of this descriptive paper consists in addressing the shortcomings of global and regional nutritional policies framework in front of the emerging trend of globesity. Conclusions stress the need to find support for broader food policies (labelling, taxes, education, bans, etc.) which currently are on the rise but lack fundamental aspects of scientific and hence social support.","[Finardi, Corrado] Confederaz Nazl Coldiretti, Food Safety Dept, Rome, Italy; [Tognon, Gianluca] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Finardi, C (通讯作者)，Confederaz Nazl Coldiretti, Food Safety Dept, Rome, Italy.",corrado.finardi@coldiretti.it,,,,,,,56,2,2,1,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Dunning himself in this context speaks of the old paradigm of development (Dunning, 2006). At the end of the 20th century, however, a number of changes, whether economic - administrative nature (decrease of barriers to international trade and investment), the major technological changes (development of the microprocessor and subsequently the development of telecommunications and transport technologies) and policy changes occur. The old paradigm of development is proving to be very narrow and does not reflect the institutional infrastructure and social capital, which seem to be essential for current development. Through these key determinants developing countries can increase their effectiveness, usage of their resources and access to international markets. In this post I will focus on the changing structure of global foreign direct investment, and whether it occurs in the context of the active role of developing countries.","Skoda Auto Vysoka Skola, Ops, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto,"Horejsí, B (通讯作者)，Skoda Auto Vysoka Skola, Ops, Na Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic.",bronislava.horejsi@savs.cz,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,466,476,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700046,0

Instead of the usual networks based on return correlations among stocks, the networks are constructed using the principle of extreme return coexceedance while the resulting edges are weighted according to the normalized mean-variance return distances. To account for possible asymmetric effects, distinct networks are created separately for extreme positive and negative return coexceedance. The resulting networks are described by their density, measured as average vertex degree and closeness, measured by harmonic centrality. To provide a possible explanation for the time-varying properties of the networks, we employ the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM), allowing for inference on the attributes related to the creation of edges. Particularly, we analyse the interconnectedness of companies traded on the same market and within the same industry as explanatory variables for the formation of links within the network.","[Lyocsa, Stefan] Univ Econ, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Quantitat Methods, Kosice, Slovakia; [Vyrost, Tomas] Univ Econ, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Financial Management, Kosice, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava,"Lyócsa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Quantitat Methods, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice, Slovakia.",stefan.lyocsa@euke.sk; tomas.vyrost@euke.sk,"Vyrost, Tomas/AAO-3780-2020; Lyocsa, Stefan/ABE-7961-2021","Vyrost, Tomas/0000-0002-8384-5724; Lyocsa, Stefan/0000-0002-8380-181X",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,888,898,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700087,0

A study was conducted to characterize water use and effluent in communities in a tea estate in the upper watershed in Sri Lanka. A questionnaire survey, field visits and focus group discussions were conducted to quantify water consumption. At a pilot scale, concentric rings with diameters of 0.3, 0.75 and 1.5 m were used for constructed wetland. Aggregates and soil were used to fill the rings. Scirpus grossus and Nasturtium officinale were planted in the middle and outer rings respectively. Wastewater from a collection tank was fed into the inner ring and treated wastewater was discharged through the outer ring. Water was sampled at the inlet - at the inner ring, middle ring and outer ring for analysis of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) and other quality parameters. Domestic water usage varied with income, education and access to water. Per capita daily water use was higher in high-income and medium-level educated people. Per capita daily water usage of stream water users and pipe-borne water users were 246 and 194 L, respectively. Major consumption was for bathing followed by laundry. BOD5 of greywater varied from 20-55 mg/L and was highly contaminated with total coliform and E coli. The pilot-scale constructed wetland showed higher removal efficiency of BOD5, SS and TDS at 85, 65 and 55%, respectively. The constructed wetlands were in concentric rings. The hydraulic retention time of 2.3 days increased the pathways and facilitated the filtration, biodegradation and plant uptake of nutrients. This system can be recommended for small communities in the upper watershed in Sri Lanka.","[Mowjood, M. I. M.; Galagedera, L.

The authors concentrated only on avoidable food waste, i.e. all wasted food and raw material that could have been consumed, had they been stored or prepared differently. Other biowaste, such as vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, or bones, was not measured. Findings - The amount of food waste in households ranged from 0 to 160 kg/year. The average annual food waste was 23 kg per capita, 63 kg per household, and in total about 120 million kg/year. When comparing purchased food amount with avoidable food waste, the average waste was about 4-5 per cent. The main discarded foodstuffs were vegetables, home-cooked food and milk products. The principal reasons for disposing of foodstuffs were spoilage: e. g. mould, expiry of best before or use by date, plate leftovers, and preparing more food than needed. When examining waste per person, singles generally produced most waste. Practical implications - Knowledge about food waste will help development of new practices to decrease waste.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on a survey questionnaire with 84 participants from large and non-large food companies of Brazil, the paper has used linear regression to examine the relationship between external integration and innovation outcomes. Next, the paper used the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test to compare the two sets of companies, i.e. large companies (annual sales > US$5 million), and non-large companies (annual sales US$1-5 million). Findings - The paper found that external integration with suppliers and customers is positively related to innovation outcomes in food companies. Besides, radical innovation is directly related to large companies rather than non-large food companies. Furthermore, customer integration is perceived in large food companies rather than non-large. To the best of the knowledge, this is pioneering information in food companies. Research limitations/implications - This research has been tested based only on participants' perceptions. Therefore, the findings should also be verified through of a longitudinal fashion or in deep study. Practical implications - The main practical implication lies with the embedding of these concepts in a research from the perspective of a developing economy. Seen in this light it is noteworthy that such findings may contribute to the understanding of innovation outcomes in other developing countries. Originality/value - There are few empirical studies that explore the relationship between external integration and innovation outcomes in food companies.

Findings - Though there exist differences between Generation X and Generation Y consumers, the empirical results are supportive of the hypothesized positive relations between financial, functional, individual and social perceptions that influence the desire for and the consumption of wine. Research limitations/implications - For future research, the findings presented in the paper support the importance of enlarging the size of the sample and collecting data in different countries to compare the results on an international level. Practical implications - Successful wine marketing strategies should focus on the customer's subjective expectations and individual value perceptions by addressing the specific value aspects that are highly relevant for consumer loyalty.

We use original survey data to analyze the factors influencing the decision to convert to organic agriculture. Previous studies have emphasized the role of spatial patterns in the diffusion and adoption of agricultural technologies in general and organic agriculture in particular. These spatial patterns can result from a variety of underlying factors. In this article we test various potential explanations, including the availability of information in the farmer's neighborhood, social conformity concerns and perceived positive external effects of the adoption decision, in a spatially explicit adoption model. We find that farmers who believe to act in accordance with their neighbors' expectations and with greater availability of information in their neighborhood network are more likely to adopt organic agriculture. Furthermore, perceived positive productivity spillovers to neighboring plots decrease the probability of adoption. We discuss the implications of our findings for the dissemination of sustainable agricultural technologies in low-potential agricultural areas in developing countries. (C) 2013 The Authors.

This unusual case study exemplifies an extension of Mancur Olson's model of stationary and roving bandits, and demonstrates how economic development can be affected in different ways by different types of dictators.","[Goldberg, Dror; Milchtaich, Igal] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Goldberg, D (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.",dg@drorgoldberg.com; Igal.Milchtaich@biu.ac.il,,"Milchtaich, Igal/0000-0002-7228-3295",,,,,48,3,3,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

If firms do not randomly fall into different groups with different technologies but by self-selection, statistically it implies the data are subject to the sample selection bias. In this paper, we generalize the stochastic frontier (SF) model to accommodate heterogeneous technologies among firms by considering the threshold SF model with an endogenous threshold variable. We discuss the econometric techniques appropriate for the threshold SF model with panel data. To determine the optimal number of regimes, we use modified the model selection criteria of Gonzalo and Pitarakis (J Econom 110(2):319-352, 2002) and investigate their finite sample performance by some Monte Carlo experiments. Finally, we also demonstrate our approach by an empirical example.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Lai, HP (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan.",ecdhpl@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,24,6,6,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

A diffusion index and a composite index establish the dates and amplitudes of seven complete cycles from 1855 to 1909 and part of an eighth, in 1910-13, interrupted by the First World War. The influence of wars and the Revolution of 1905 on the Russian cycle is clear. A comparison of diffusion indices for Russia and Germany reveals that Russian cycles occasionally diverged from the European pattern in the absence of war and revolution, notably during the industrial boom of the 1890s.

Consumers therefore have an incentive to search for the lowest prices. However, when a product is purchased infrequently, the effort to check the price every shopping trip might outweigh the benefit of spending less. I propose a structural model for storable goods that takes into account inventory holdings and search. The model is estimated using data on laundry detergent purchases. I find search costs play a large role in explaining purchase behavior, with consumers unaware of the price of detergent on 70 % of their shopping trips. Therefore, from the retailer's point of view raising awareness of a promotion through advertising and displays is important. I also find a promotion for a particular product increases the consumer's incentive to search. This change in incentives leads to an increase in category traffic, which from the store manager's perspective is a desirable side effect of the promotion.","[Seiler, Stephan] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Seiler, Stephan] Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 7AE, England; [Seiler, Stephan] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England",Stanford University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Seiler, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sseiler@stanford.edu,,"Seiler, Stephan/0000-0001-8636-1840",ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,25,70,99,0,63,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

German investment pattern and rearmament during the Nazi period,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMY,"Today, most scholars agree that Nazi Germany did not follow a premeditated Blitzkrieg strategy in the late 1930s and at the beginning of the Second World War. However, the question of the extent to which Germany's economy had been prepared for a longer war is still debated because statistical information on Germany's investment pattern is fragmentary and data on the structure of prewar German military expenditure are not available. Relying on newly discovered sources, this article closes these gaps. The Nazi regime clearly shifted its investment towards preparation for war from the mid-1930s on, and though armaments purchases stagnated during the period from 1937 to 1939, investment in munitions industries grew considerably. Consequently, during the late 1930s the Nazis pursued a 'sustainable' rearmament strategy necessary for fighting a longer war. Yet, despite massive capacity enlargements in the munitions industries, total German investment was not unusually high by today's definition because contemporary figures included a significant amount of armaments purchases.","NTNU Trondheim, Dept Hist & Class Studies, N-7049 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Scherner, J (通讯作者)，NTNU Trondheim, Dept Hist & Class Studies, N-7049 Trondheim, Norway.",,,,,,,,46,13,13,3,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

However TAW is not associated with value added per employee. Employees in workplaces with TAW receive higher wages than observationally equivalent employees in non-TAW workplaces. But the presence of TAW in the employee's occupation is associated with lower wages for employees in that occupation. Furthermore, conditioning on wages, the presence of TAW at the workplace is associated with lower job satisfaction and higher job anxiety among employees. These findings are consistent with TAW having an adverse effect on employees' experiences at work, perhaps due a more labour intensive regime, one which is only partly compensated for with higher wages.","Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London SW1P 3HE, England",,"Bryson, A (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, 2 Dean Trench St, London SW1P 3HE, England.",a.bryson@niesr.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,28,16,17,0,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The New Institutional Economics literature recognizes that appropriate policy choice and design will be a function of the specific characteristics of the problem. The physical and institutional determinants of both transaction costs and abatement costs should be considered in the policy design process due to potential interactions between them. Analysts also need to incorporate the extent to which the technologies, institutional environment, governance structures, or policy designs can be changed; some factors can only be adjusted to or designed around while others can be designed differently. This framework highlights the importance of property rights since transaction costs will be incurred to obtain or retain property rights and since the rights assignment may affect both the magnitudes and distribution of costs. Another implication is that education and extension programs or use of behavioral economics concepts to affect choices can be cost-effective in some circumstances. Policy design should take advantage of economies of scale and foster technical change. Appropriate sequencing of policy instruments may decrease transaction costs, particularly if there is potential for technical change. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Since the late 1980s, pressure from government and environmental groups has been increasing for gardeners and professional growers to reduce their peat use. However, significant volumes of peat are still being used in UK horticulture and the majority of this (69% or 2.03 million cubic metres) is consumed by amateur gardeners (Anon, 2010a). Although the RHS has been working with government, non-governmental organisations, retailers, nurseries, trade associations, and media manufacturers for many years on this issue, progress away from a market dominated by peat-based products has been slower than many had hoped for. We believe there are five over-riding factors: 1) Patchy provision of fit for purpose peat-reduced and peat-free alternatives (i.e. ensuring quality and consistency of product). 2) Economics of the growing media supply chain (e. g. product development and production costs). 3) Motivation of gardeners to change (including awareness of bag content and environmental issues associated with peat use). 4) Achieving successful gardening without peat (e. g. adapting plant management techniques). 5) Overcoming previous adverse experiences (i.e. building consumer confidence). We believe that a co-ordinated strategy of raising public awareness of the environmental issues, explaining the importance of good growing media for successful gardening, improved product information on bags and company websites alongside research and development into better products is required to bring about change in behaviour amongst UK gardeners to reduce peat use.","[Alexander, P.

Design/methodology/approach - The Delphi method was applied in order to obtain judgments of different experts regarding the driving forces of the fresh tomato industry in Italy and in Germany. A total of 14 experts of the fresh vegetables market participated in a three-rounds survey; a qualitative analysis of experts' judgments drew to a possible future of the fresh tomato industry. Findings - From the results it is possible to conclude that the service in the offer of the products will mostly influence the trend of the fresh tomato industry; this includes marketing, communication, quality certifications, special packaging (as ready to eat products). Furthermore variety selection and typicality of the product will play, as well, a fundamental role in the market trend of the fresh tomato. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a small sample of experts, using a qualitative approach. Therefore these findings may strongly depend on the choice of the subjects. Practical implications - The results may offer useful suggestions to managers and practitioners on the most promising strategies for the future. Originality/value - On the methodological side, this study represents a useful contribution to qualitative food research, since the Delphi method approach was rarely used in the past. In addition, it has not been previously used in forecasting a possible scenario in the fresh vegetables industry.","[Bazzani, Claudia] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Canavari, Maurizio] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ & Engn, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Bazzani, C (通讯作者)，Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",claudia.bazzani@yahoo.it,"Canavari, Maurizio/A-7247-2008","Canavari, Maurizio/0000-0003-0573-7880",,,,,22,10,11,3,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Many aspects of eating out have been studied, yet emotions remain an under-researched area, despite having been shown to play a significant role in food consumption. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reports findings from a qualitative study, involving semi-structured interviews with British undergraduates about changes in their emotional state after eating their lunchtime meal. Data were analysed through the technique of thematic analysis. Findings - Participants observed a clear relationship between their emotions and eating a meal, with changes noted in concentration, energy and happiness levels. The quality of the food eaten was an issue of concern to participants; access to a healthy meal was seen to be important, given the perceived benefits for emotional and physical health. Finally, eating was deemed to be both a physical and social activity. Eating in company enhanced the emotional experience of dining, as it offered the opportunity to bond with friends. Recommendations for further research are made. Originality/value - This research addresses a paucity of information on the link between food and emotion, helping to better understand the role of emotions when eating out. Further research into different settings is called for in order to broaden the understanding of the relationship between eating and emotional state, and to find out whether or not similar findings emerge from alternative settings.","[Brown, Lorraine; Edwards, John; Hartwell, Heather] Bournemouth Univ, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Brown, L (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",LBrown@bournemouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,67,16,19,0,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This research begins by reviewing relevant literature that frames the concept of perceived value in CSA and integrates this construct into a nomological network. Operational measures for each component of perceived value in CSA are then developed. The scale is validated, and then used to test the hypothesized model in a sample of 198 consumers of Beijing's five CSA farms using partial least squares (PLS) as an analytical tool. Findings - Perceived value in CSA is found to be a formative, multi-dimensional, third-order construct. Further, the results suggest that perceived value in CSA has both a direct positive effect on consumer loyalty and an indirect effect mediated through consumer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - Limitations and research directions refer to the need to increase the sample size and replicate research in other places, the possibility of conducting longitudinal research, the need to identify antecedents of perceived value, and the opportunity to assess perceived value across a number of CSA member characteristics. Practical implications - CSA farmers should recognize the importance of value creation to build and maintain long time relationships. This study suggests that CSA farmers can enhance value from two approaches. One approach is to build strategies to facilitate delivery of product benefits, emotional benefits, and social benefits. Another approach is to invest in efforts to reduce inconvenience and lower risk. In addition, the formative model means that CSA farmers can allocate resources depending on the relative weight of each in value perceptions. Originality/value - This research is one of the first to conceptualize perceived value in a CSA setting; it argues that modeling of perceived value in CSA should take a formative approach and finds support for this; and assesses the nomological validity of the perceived value in CSA.","Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Chen, WP (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenweipingruc@gmail.com,"Chen, Wei/GZK-7348-2022; chen, weidong/JZT-5874-2024","chen, weidong/0009-0006-1337-808X","Chinese National Natural Science Foundation [70972132]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [11XNJ022, 12XNK030]",Chinese National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"The author is very grateful to this journal's Guest Editors and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

Design/methodology/approach - The work was developed during four weeks in order to allow the evaluation of parameters of an entire menu cycle. The index of waste/consumption (%) was obtained by the ratio between plate waste and the quantity of foods distributed, subtracting the weight of leftovers. Findings - The average index of waste/consumption was approximately 24 percent, higher in the days with a fish menu, values considered unacceptable. Each canteen user is served with approximately 940 g of foods, from which only 660 g were effectively consumed, corresponding to 80 g of leftovers and 200 g of waste. Originality/value - It seems possible and desirable to reduce food waste in order to optimize food unit profitability and sustainability. Reducing food waste will contribute to improve foodservice quality as well as consumer's satisfaction. Potential strategies to achieve this goal may include previous booking of meals, to adopt tray less during lunch and additionally analyze the eating patterns for a particular forecasted meal, and then prepare and serve food based on the appropriate forecast.","[Ferreira, Manuela; Martins, Margarida Liz; Rocha, Ada] Univ Porto, Fac Nutr & Food Sci, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Rocha, A (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Nutr & Food Sci, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",adarocha@fcna.up.pt,"Martins, Margarida Liz/AAL-6246-2021; Rocha, Ada/D-8199-2013","Liz Martins, Margarida/0000-0001-6870-3632; Rocha, Ada/0000-0003-3505-4538",,,,,42,59,66,3,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors undertake a literature review of the coriander plant's history, chemical composition of coriander parts and its oil, and their nutraceutical potential. Various phytopharmacological appraisals have been discussed at length to investigate their important potential. Findings - Coriander is an annual, herbaceous plant which originated from the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions and known as medicinal plants. Coriander contains an essential oil (0.03-2.6%). The different parts of this plant contain monoterpenes, limpnene, alpha-pinene, gamma-terpinene, p-cymene, citronellol, borneol, camphor, coriandrin, geraniol, dihydrocoriandrin, coriandronsA-E, flavonoids and essential oils. It is used as a stomachic, spasmolytic and carminative which have a greater bioactive property. Various parts of this plant, such as seeds, leaves, flower and fruit, possess antioxidant activity, diuretic, anti-convulsant anti-diabetic activity, sedative hypnotic activity, anti-mutagenic, anti-microbial activity, anthelmintic activity. The physical properties, chemical composition and bioactivity affect the coriander's commercial value. Research limitations/implications - Currently available information on coriander seeds and leaves is insufficient. These observations have led to continuing research aimed at identifying specific bioactive components in foods, such as antioxidants, which may be responsible for improving and maintaining health. Antioxidants are present in foods as vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and polyphenols. Coriander is also rich in such compounds. Research supports that some of these foods, as part of an overall healthful diet, have the potential to delay the onset of many age-related diseases, so there is urgent need to explore the role of these compounds. Originality/value - This review is unique in its comprehensive nature and reflects the importance of coriander as a medicinal food.","[Nadeem, Muhammad; Anjum, Faqir Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Issa; Tehseen, Saima] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Natl Inst Food Sci & Technol, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [El-Ghorab, Ahmed] Natl Res Ctr, Food Ind & Nutr Div, Cairo, Egypt; [Sultan, Javed Iqbal] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Anim Nutr & Feed Technol, Faisalabad, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); National Research Centre (NRC); University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Khan, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Natl Inst Food Sci & Technol, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",issa1395@hotmail.com,"anjum, Faqir/F-5883-2015; Nadeem, Muhammad/AAZ-2541-2021; El Ghorab, Prof. Dr .

In the 337 largest, independent, UK companies in the Investor's year book (those with (sic)1 million or more quoted share capital in 1911), the generality of public shareholders were a narrower group than today, but directors personally owned only 3.4 per cent of the shares. This indicates a lower level of personal ownership (and board voting control) in the largest securities market of the early twentieth century than in any of the world's major securities markets toward the end of that century. Berle, Means, Gordon, and others subsequently quantified the US's later and (on this dimension) less advanced managerial 'revolution'. Their evidence was widely misinterpreted: some erroneously concluded that the US pioneered this aspect of 'modernity' and that the 'divorce' of ownership from control, globally, was a new and continuing trend.","[Foreman-Peck, James] Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Hannah, Leslie] London Sch Econ, London, England",Cardiff University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Foreman-Peck, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",,,"foreman-peck, james/0000-0001-9826-5725",,,,,92,55,59,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In this article, I identify a different set of constitutional reforms, explain why precedents for these reforms did not lessen their revolutionary impact, and show that the evidence, properly evaluated, supports a view of the Revolution as a watershed.","Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Cox, GW (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 616 Serra St,Encina Hall W,Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gwcox@stanford.edu,,"Cox, Gary/0000-0002-9256-5193",,,,,51,46,54,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

This method is ideally suited for systematically investigating the economic phenomena that arise as one moves through the parameter space and is especially useful in games that have multiple equilibria. We briefly discuss the theory of the homotopy method and its application to dynamic stochastic games. We then present three main findings: First, the more costly and/or less beneficial it is to achieve or maintain a given quality level, the more a leader invests in striving to induce the follower to give up; the more quickly the follower does so; and the more asymmetric is the industry structure that arises. Second, the possibility of entry and exit gives rise to predatory and limit investment. Third, we illustrate and discuss the multiple equilibria that arise in the quality ladder model, highlighting the presence of entry and exit as a source of multiplicity.","[Borkovsky, Ron N.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Doraszelski, Ulrich] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kryukov, Yaroslav] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of Toronto; University of Pennsylvania; Carnegie Mellon University,"Borkovsky, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",ron.borkovsky@rotman.utoronto.ca; doraszelski@wharton.upenn.edu; kryukov@cmu.edu,,,,,,,50,15,21,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

I argue that the temporal domain of regime effectiveness is not adequately dealt with by the current measurement concepts and develop three amendments to the Oslo-Potsdam solution. First, I suggest to measure effectiveness over the time interval the regime is in operation in order to capture welfare gains over time. Second, I propose an amendment that takes the pre-regime phase into account and I suggest a way to assess the loss of potential welfare brought about by delays in negotiating the regime. Third, I take temporal externalities of regime policies into account. Dealing with these three aspects of the temporal domain of regime effectiveness is important for obtaining complete and unbiased measurements. Achieving this is important in itself but also for comparative research, the assessment of regime dynamics, and ultimately for advising on policy.","Univ Kent, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Grundig, F (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury, Kent, England.",f.grundig@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,5,6,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In addition, the potential contribution to family earnings from spinning will be examined. Just about all of the millions of yards of woollen yarn that went into making English cloth had to be spun by women and children, but this activity has not been investigated to the extent that it deserves. Spinning was a skilled occupation where there was a great demand for the best quality product. Sources exist which make it possible to make general estimates of the amount of spinning needed in the economy, and its cost. This evidence shows that employment in spinning increased dramatically from the late seventeenth century, and continued to increase until there were probably over one million women and children employed in spinning by the mid-eighteenth century. In addition earnings increased to the extent whereby earnings from spinning could contribute over 30 per cent of household income for poorer families. This has implications for looking at trends in real wages over time, as well as for the concept of the industrious revolution.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Muldrew, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,"Azevedo, Micheline/JHT-0825-2023",,,,,,88,57,61,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

However, there is increasing public and policy interest in the notion of a carbon footprint, or CO2 generated globally to serve final consumption demand within a region. This raises an issue in that, despite the local economic benefits, the latter involves effectively absolving the region of responsibility for CO2 generated in the production of exports. Using a CGE model of Wales. we illustrate by simulating an increase in export demand for the output of an industry (metal production) that is both carbon and export intensive and generally produces to meet intermediate rather than final demands. The key result is economic growth accompanied by a widening gap between regional CO2 generation and the carbon footprint, raising questions as to the identification of precisely 'whose' carbon footprint these additional emissions should be allocated to.

In this experiment we explore if the level of voluntary donations varies under different treatments that include taxes (high and low levels) and voting treatments on choosing and obligatory imposition of taxes (high vs. low and low vs. no tax). Our results show that participants only self-impose mandatory contributions when they must choose between a high or low tax, and rarely passing the high tax. In addition, we find that those individuals who voted for a high tax and are in a group where the majority votes for the low tax conform to their earlier vote by contributing more. Further, our data supports an incomplete crowding-out of voluntary donations by the application of tourism taxes earmarked for environmental purposes. From a policy perspective, this result supports the potential for a complementary use of taxes and voluntary donations for fundraising environmental projects in tourism destinations.

We find that the fining schemes induce under-abatement, a feature being enforced with experience. We further elicit the participants' risk attitude and show that the performance of collective fining is not affected by the subjects' risk preferences. Under a system based on random fining the performance of the mechanism worsens in the presence of risk seeking subjects. However, coordination on over-abatement under the tax-subsidy can be alleviated if subjects are risk averse. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Biophysical economics has contributed to conventional economics by incorporating thermodynamic and ecological principles and emphasising the importance of natural resources to economic processes. This paper is presented in two parts. Part 1 gives a historic review of biophysical economics and discusses some previous models of the energy-economy system built around the principles of biophysical economics. Part 2 presents the GEMBA model - a new modelling methodology in the biophysical economics tradition. The methodology proposes a new and important contribution to the field of biophysical economics; a lifetime evolving function for the dynamics of the energy return on investment (EROI). The dynamic EROI function was incorporated into the GEMBA model and implemented in Vensim. The model is calibrated using historical energy production data, i.e. trained to historical data. The trained model is run to 2100 under a variety of assumptions regarding availability of energy resources and corresponding EROI's. The main finding of the model is that growth of the renewable energy sector may impact investment in other areas of the economy and thereby stymie economic growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The ability for substitution between and within each stock over time has been widely debated, resulting in the identification, and then preservation of 'critical capital stocks'. We propose that 'critical' can be defined from two ethical perspectives; teleological or consequentialist (goal or ends based) and deontological (moral duty and rule based). The consequential ethic ensures critical capitals are 'utilitarian' in value and they generate goods and services for the maintenance of human wellbeing. Whilst deontologically critical capital depends on culturally and psychologically 'protected' values, which may vary locally or at least (as for, e.g., biodiversity) be open to conflicting opinions. This separation in the basis for defining critical capital stocks leads to awareness that some tradeoffs between critical capital stocks may be irreconcilable or likely to lead to outrage. A framework is developed to guide practitioners as to how to identify critical capital stocks using both protected and utilitarian values. Examples show that 'protected' values are likely to be specific to community (ethnic, religious, cultural, etc.) and require different methods for resolving substitutability of capital stocks to achieve sustainable development.

There are a number of alternative ways of dealing with missing data. The problem of handling missing data has been treated adequately in various real world data sets. Several statistical methods have been developed since the early 1970s, when the manipulation of complicated numerical calculations became feasible with the advance of computers. The purpose of this research is to estimate missing values by using artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy regression models, and approach in a complete randomized block design table (analysis of variance) and to compare the computational results with two other methods, namely the approximate analysis and exact regression method. It is concluded that ANN provides much better estimation than the conventional approaches.

This article, drawing on survey evidence from Spain, aims to examine the causal relationship between attitudes towards science and attitudes towards GM food. Design/methodology/approach - The research employs structural equation modeling and explores this association by using sub-samples made of regional groups that have GM agriculture. Findings - The results suggest specific behavioral mechanisms in explaining GM consumer attitudes involving attitudes towards science whilst medical and food applications appear to have no (or mild) significant connection in the formation of attitudes towards GM food. Significant influence from age and previously characterized attitude in the formation of structural models is found. Practical implications - The article has implications for a better understanding of the behavioral mechanisms behind the acceptance of GM food. Originality/value - This article puts forward several hypotheses on the influence of general meta-attitudes (towards science and technology) underpinning behavioral explanations for consumer judgments of acceptance towards GM food.","[Costa-Font, Montserrat; Gil, Jose M.] Ctr Res Agrofood Econ & Dev CREDA UPC IRTA, Castelldefels, Spain",IRTA,"Costa-Font, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Res Agrofood Econ & Dev CREDA UPC IRTA, Castelldefels, Spain.",Montserrat.Costa-Font@upc.edu,"Costa Font, Montserrat/M-8818-2017; GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012; Costa-Font, Montserrat/P-3282-2019","Costa Font, Montserrat/0000-0001-6796-0813; GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052; Costa-Font, Montserrat/0000-0001-6796-0813",,,,,46,16,18,3,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - In this study, consumers in urban areas of Van, in Turkey, were grouped according to their self-perceived social-economic status and their behaviors and attitudes on purchase of food products are examined according to that social-economic status. The study was conducted in Van province, Turkey, during 2007-2008. Face to face interviews with 300 consumers work through the survey data was collected. Participants were asked to indicate their socio-economic status from a choice of top, middle and bottom level groups. Findings - Within the top and middle level of this grouping, the percentage of high school graduates is high; at the bottom level of this status, the proportion of university graduates is high. A large percentage of the consumers are public servants and business owners. It was observed that as the socio-economic status increased, the proportion of business owners increased as well. Consumers in lower status groups spend the biggest portion of their income on food products. As the wages increase, the level of spending on food product decreases proportionally and the ability to make savings increases. The highest status consumers always check the price labels of the food products with a high percentage (66.67 percent). More than half of consumers do not believe that producers write all information and ingredients of the products on the packaging. A total of 77 percent of study participants stated that they were open to trying new food products. Consumers within the top socio-economic groups are most careful about food ingredients. Originality/value - In this study, the consumers themselves are classified according to their socio-economic status. These are the top, middle and bottom status as determined. Consumers are clustered according to the general characteristics of the correspondence analysis.","[Koc, Besir] Bingol Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Bingol, Turkey; [Ceylan, Melike] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Bingol University; Akdeniz University,"Koç, B (通讯作者)，Bingol Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Bingol, Turkey.",dr_besirkoc@yahoo.com,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The pace of change has meant that food safety systems have struggled to keep up. In 2007 food safety incidents damaged the reputation of aquatic products in export markets. The Chinese Government has moved quickly to strengthen the safety regime for aquatic products. The purpose of this paper is to assess these initiatives in the context of their potential to regain international acceptance of Chinese aquatic products. Design/methodology/approach - A regulatory assessment approach is used. Findings - The findings are that increased government oversight alone is not likely to lead to a fully effective food safety system for aquatic products. The development of private sector-based incentives to encourage investment in food safety is an essential co-requisite to increased government oversight if China's access to international markets is to be assured. Originality/value - The value of this study lies in the light it sheds on the efforts of a major player in the international market for aquatic products to improve the efficacy of its food safety system. China's regulatory regimes are often opaque, limiting the ability of those wishing to assess the advisability of importing food products from China.","[Kerr, William A.; Hobbs, Jill E.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Liu, Huanan] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Dept Food Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Saskatchewan; Shanghai Ocean University,"Kerr, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",william.kerr@usask.ca,,"Hobbs, Jill/0000-0003-0357-6817",EU [222889]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars; Chinese State Education Ministry; Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy Research Network (CATPRN),EU(European Union (EU)); Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); Chinese State Education Ministry; Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy Research Network (CATPRN),"Funding for this research was provided by the Sustaining Ethical Aquaculture Trade project funded by EU 7th Framework Programme (Grant agreement no. 222889), the Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, Chinese State Education Ministry and the Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy Research Network (CATPRN).",,27,38,41,4,92,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A major question with an aging population is whether increases in life expectancy will be associated with a greater or lesser proportion of the future population spending their years living with disability. An improvement in healthy life years is considered as one of the main health goals for the EU. Disability-free life expectancy (healthy life years - HLY) introduces the concept of quality of life. HLY and life expectancy are the head indicators of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy in the fifths theme of Public Health. The life expectancy at birth rose moderately between 2005 and 2010; in general people are living longer. The faster growth rate for men indicates narrowing of the gap in life expectancy between women and men mainly at the EU level. While life expectancy constitutes as a conventional and solid indicator to reflect general health and health care conditions in different countries, the indicator of healthy life years adds complementary information on the quality of life.","[Megyesiova, Silvia; Lieskovska, Vanda] Podnikovohosp Fak EU, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",,,megyesiova@euke.sk; lieskovska@euke.sk,"Lieskovska, Vanda/AAI-4530-2021; Megyesiova, Silvia/J-1056-2018","Megyesiova, Silvia/0000-0002-6815-5629; Lieskovska, Vanda/0000-0003-0392-4877",,,,,10,6,6,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,766,775,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500071,0

There exists a critical level of exchanged messages among members, below which an online forum will not be self-sustainable (Wasco et al., 2009). The topic of why people contribute to fora in general has been extensively studied, and can be traced back to the 1960' when Olson (1965) who noted that contribution only occurs for individuals when gains excess payments. Subsequently, critical mass theory (Oliver, 1980; Marwell et al. 1988) leads to a more specific situation in which a small number of initial contributors can lead to mass collaboration. This theory can be true in online fora which are characterized by a scale-free complex system where several influential members play a vital role in the expansion of the forum. This study seeks explanations for the sustainability of online fora by incorporating critical mass theory into online statistics analysis. It tests the logical relationships among five variables which represent individual contribution motivations. Results indicates that the distribution also known as the probability of a member with K connections (here denoted as the maxim connections) follows the power law. Secondly, the logic of contribution behaviours initially presented by Oliver (1980) is suitable for the analysis in online fora. This research reflects a pioneering stream in social network analysis which takes into account the social capital factors as well as complex network theory.","[Palmer, Adrian; Hudson, Sarah; Huo, Qunying] ESC Rennes Sch Business, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business,,adrian.palmer@esc-rennes.fr; sarah.hudson@esc-rennes.fr; qunying.huo@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,890,902,,,,,,13,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500083,0

Large firms develop knowledge dynamics at a greater distance compare to others.

We found that theory-driven analytical and branding-driven symbolic knowledge types are more anchored than synthetic knowledge which is precisely the type of knowledge considered as the main resource in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

The branches were divided into three sectors; the technologically intensive sector, the knowledge intensive sector and other. Crisis period is defined as period of decreasing increases of gross value added. The theoretic part is based on the real business cycle theory and the neo-classical growth models of Solow. The analysis was conducted on data from the years 1995-2009 taken in the Czech Republic. The analysis has found that the sector of knowledge-intensive services has the biggest contribution to the average annual change in labour productivity and capital productivity in crisis period. In the period of increasing increments of gross value added has the biggest influence sector of technology-intensive industries.

It captures that pollutive consumption is sensitive to consumption by others and commercial advertising. This is conceptualized through a consumption norm. An increase in this norm means that consumers will become dissatisfied with a given consumption level and try to raise it, which will cause an increase in pollution. The model is particularly relevant for the study of conspicuous consumption which generally is subject to concentrated advertising efforts while it generates considerable pollution. The model can accommodate the cases of an externality created by advertising being positive or negative. We also show that using different functional specifications for the norm function one can address either conformity or status seeking. We derive optimal rules for a pollution tax, a subsidy or tax on advertising, and information provision by the government. The results not only contribute to more realism in environmental policy theory but also extend public policy with new instruments.

However, direct empirical evidence of the impact of consumer risk aversion on the adoption of energy efficient technologies has been limited. In this paper, we elicit consumer risk preferences using a multiple price list experiment tailored to household energy decisions. We then use the elicited risk preferences to explain consumers' self-reported historical purchase of energy efficient appliances and installation of energy efficiency retrofitting technologies. Using data from 432 homeowners from Arizona and California, USA, results show that more risk averse consumers are less likely to adopt energy efficient technologies (except for the case of energy efficient air-conditioners). In addition, the findings provide evidence that households' perceived mobility as measured by the probability of moving within five years, can amplify the negative impact of risk aversion on the adoption of energy efficiency retrofitting technologies.

A data envelopment analysis framework that compares producers with similar pollution control efforts is proposed. First, my approach avoids arbitrary disposability assumptions for undesirable outputs. Second, the model is used to evaluate the interplay between pollution control activities and technical efficiency. I compare my approach to the traditional neo-classical production model that does not incorporate undesirable outputs among outputs, and to Fare et al.'s (Rev Econ Stat 71:90-98, 1989, J Econom 126:469-492, 2005) well-known model that incorporates bads. I evaluate the common assumption in the literature on polluting technologies, that inputs are allocatable to pollution control, and apply U.S. electricity data to illustrate my main point: Although my empirical model specifications are in line with the literature on polluting technologies, they rely on inputs that play an insignificant role in controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Consequentially, there are no reasons to expect the efficiency scores of the traditional model to differ from the efficiency scores of the other two models that account for resources employed to pollution control. Statistical tests show that my model, which explicitly takes pollution control efforts into account, produces efficiency scores that are not statistically different from the traditional model's scores for all model specifications, while Fare et al.'s model produces significantly different results for some model specifications. I conclude that the popular production models that incorporate undesirable outputs may not be applicable to all cases involving polluting production and that more emphasis on appropriate empirical specifications is needed.","Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Rodseth, KL (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",klr@toi.no,,"Rodseth, Kenneth Lovold/0000-0002-4453-2231",,,,,44,11,11,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Bio-geographic factors however play a crucial role in determining the level of risk associated with trade. We develop an analytical treatment of bioclimatic similarity between trade partners, within a model that links the incidence of invasive species to resource extraction, pollution and to import volumes disaggregated by country and region of origin. The model, estimated with data on invasive species of all taxa in 123 countries, shows that considering the geographical structure of trade flows and the bioclimatic similarity between sources and destinations substantially improves our understanding of the drivers of biological invasions. The results allow us to identify, in a worldwide perspective, the relative risk of biological invasions (in general, and by habitat type) entailed by different commercial partners.

Thus, discounted utilitarianism implies that we hardly need to protect future generations against climate change, while classical utilitarianism implies that we should reduce our consumption across the board to benefit future generations. The insolubility of the debate derives from the fact that both classical and discounted utilitarianism permit only a single discount rate for all consequences occurring in the same future year, while our intuitions clearly do distinguish between consequences, depending on whether we cause adverse effects on other people's interests and violate their rights. Most people share the moral intuition that we ought to refrain from harming others, and ought to compensate them if we were unable to prevent harm. To regain a reflective equilibrium between such deontological intuitions and economic theory there is a need to accept different discount rates for different situations: a zero consumption discount rate in the case of cost-benefit analysis of measures to prevent wrongful harm to future generations, and standard discounting in all other cases. Applying a zero consumption discount rate means that future generations are automatically largely compensated for climate damage that remains unmitigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper quantifies embodied carbon in bilateral trade at the product level. This is done using the material balance approach, by collecting product carbon intensity factors from multiple data sources and combining with bilateral trade data in physical quantities. The dataset covers trades between 195 countries for 1080 products in 2006. The detailed mapping of trade embodied carbon provides detailed insights into the nature of the flows that were previously masked or under-reported. For example, it finds that the lion's share of global trade embodied emissions are concentrated in a relatively small number of product categories of traded goods, suggesting that focusing mitigation efforts and trade-measures on these products would be an effective strategy to address potential carbon leakage, and to decarbonise international supply chains. The results also highlight that embodied carbon is focused in regional trade, thus regional harmonisation of climate mitigation policy will be effective in mitigating leakage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We calculate footprints by combining expenditure data with life-cycle greenhouse gas emission intensities derived from an environmentally extended input-output model. By applying regression analysis, we explore the effects of expenditure, urbanity, and household size on total, direct, and indirect emissions. The separate analyses for direct and indirect GHGs provide insights, not previously found in the literature, on the relationship between urbanity and carbon footprints. Holding expenditure constant, a rural lifestyle seems to be related to the highest GHG emissions. However, keeping in mind that the absolute amount of indirect emissions is major to direct emissions from home energy and private driving, the less prominent or even reversed relationship between indirect emissions and urbanity is also worth noting. The existence of household size scale effects depends whether direct or indirect GHGs are explained. We demonstrate that in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of mitigation policies and their effects, not only the averages but the various patterns of direct and direct emissions must be kept in mind. This paper complements the earlier carbon footprint assessments from the same authors by providing a comprehensive statistical analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Ecofeminist economics has much to offer to each of these approaches, but these contributions remain, as of yet, unrealized. The Green New Deal largely represents the green economy, which holds economic success as contingent upon the ecological restructuring of industrial production. The degrowth approach more fundamentally raises questions concerning the relationship between material prosperity and individual and social well-being. The principles of the solidarity economy involve the immediate implementation of the principles of self-determination and cooperation. None of these approaches takes into account the claims of ecofeminist economics; and none of them clearly view gender equity as essential to economic change. The three approaches are, however, deeply gendered in the sense that they are implicitly based on assumptions concerning women's labor in the sphere of social reproduction. This article demonstrates how each approach can be improved upon by the integration of ecofeminist economic principles in order to achieve economic change that also meets claims for gender equity.

It is well established that England saw increased storminess and heavy rainfall in this period, but this article suggests that the impact of drought-which became a common feature of the English climate during the 1320s and early 1330s-has been overlooked. Based primarily on a detailed analysis of account rolls for over 60 of the best-documented manors in this period, the article establishes that drought brought devastating harvest failure and caused severe outbreaks of a number of diseases, plausibly including enteric infections, malaria, and winter and spring fevers. As a result, mortality surged and population levels fell in communities in affected regions, which were mainly confined to the southern and eastern counties of England. The article concludes that such regional variation significantly affects our understanding of demographic, agricultural, and even fiscal trends in this period. Although we should not disregard the human factors influencing the impact of environmental shocks, England was plainly struck with indubitable force by extreme weather in this pivotal phase of the medieval economy.",,,,,,,,,,,88,19,21,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We find that by imposing a tax 50 pound per tonne of CO2 the 37% CO2 reduction target is met with a very rapid adjustment in all three cases if the model incorporates forward-looking behaviour. However, the adjustment is much slower if agents are myopic.

The water scarcity problem in China is characterized by a mismatch between the spatial distributions of water resources, economic development and other primary factors of production, which leads to the separation of production and consumption of water-intensive products. In this paper, we quantify the scale and structure of virtual water trade and consumption-based water footprints at the provincial level in China based on a multi-regional input-output model. We found that virtual water withdrawals and consumption embodied in domestic trade amounts to 184 billion m(3) and 101 billion m(3) in 2007, respectively, which is equivalent to 38% and 39% of national total fresh water withdrawals and consumption, respectively. Virtual water trade embodied in domestic trade is about two times as much as virtual water embodied in China's international exports. Water footprint in all four municipalities, i.e., Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing, depends heavily on virtual water inflow from other provinces. China has a north-to-south net VWT pattern which is roughly the opposite of the distribution of its water resources. In addition to water efficiency improvement measures, re-shaping the water-trade nexus can be a significant complementary tool to address local water scarcity problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We use the model to examine how various determinants of competition, such as product substitutability, entry costs, and innovation spillovers, affect firms' equilibrium strategies for entry, exit, and investment in product quality. We find an inverted-U relationship between product substitutability and innovation: the returns to innovation initially rise for all firms but eventually, as the market approaches a winner-take-all environment, laggards have few residual profits to fight over and give up pursuit of the leader, knowing he will defend his lead. The increasing portion of the inverted-U reflects changes in firm's investment policy functions, whereas the decreasing portion arises from the industry transiting to states with fewer firms and wider quality gaps. Allowing market structure to be endogenous yields different results compared to extant work that fixes or exogenously varies the market structure.","[Goettler, Ronald L.] Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Gordon, Brett R.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Rochester; Columbia University,"Gordon, BR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ronald.goettler@simon.rochester.edu; brg2114@columbia.edu,"Gordon, Brett Russell/KCX-9518-2024","Gordon, Brett Russell/0000-0001-9081-569X",,,,,63,24,27,3,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The aim of this paper is to explore and compare adolescents' and older adults' own perceptions of the barriers and facilitators of a change towards healthier eating. Design/methodology/approach - This study design consisted of four focus groups that were conducted with adolescents and older adults to identify their health orientations, and their expected and experienced outcomes and self-efficacies in implementing approach and avoidance behaviours in relation to healthy eating, i.e. increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables and decreasing consumption of soft drinks and red meat. Findings - The study resulted in a number of interesting insights, e.g. that older and younger participants alike: were keen not to seem overly healthy to their important others, had a demonstratively detached orientation towards healthy eating and felt that their diets were generally healthy (although this was generally disproved by their self-reported intake data). Originality/value - The study and findings reported in this article contribute by providing the first steps towards a better understanding of how social cognition and self-efficacy perceptions related to healthy eating develop in the transitional phases of adolescence and older adulthood. In order to complement and validate the findings of the study; and with the aim of facilitating efficient nutritional change interventions directed at adolescents and older people, further studies should be conducted.","[Bech-Larsen, Tino; Kazbare, Laura] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Adm, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Bech-Larsen, T (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Adm, Aarhus, Denmark.",tib@asb.dk,,,,,,,29,12,13,1,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The objective is to introduce and test a conceptual model that four sets of factors (food choice motivations, demographic and socio-economic characteristics, knowledge of functional food and health status) underpin variations in functional food consumption. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected via face-to-face interviews conducted in respondents' homes. Consumption of functional foods is modelled as a bootstrapped ordered probit model. Findings - Results confirm the significant influence of all four sets of factors for explaining variations in functional food consumption. Heavier users of functional food are those that place a greater weighting on health and convenience in food choice. In contrast, the salience of familiarity in food choice is negatively related with functional food consumption. Females and those with higher levels of educational attainment are heavier consumers of functional food. While perceived health status appears not to have any significant relationship with functional food consumption, there is a link with body mass index. Functional foods appeal most to those concerned about their health and desire convenient, quick fixes. Such quick fixes may however be employed at the expense of more fundamental adjustments to diet and fitness, which may provide the basis for superior overall disease prevention/health promotion. Originality/value - The study represents one of the first assessments of functional food consumption in Central and Eastern Europe, introducing and testing a comprehensive conceptual model.","[Brecic, Ruzica] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Dept Mkt, Zagreb, Croatia; [Gorton, Matthew] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Barjolle, Dominique] ETH, DUWIS, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zagreb; Newcastle University - UK; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Brecic, R (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Dept Mkt, Zagreb, Croatia.",rbrecic@efzg.hr,"Brečić, Ružica/P-6266-2019; Gorton, Matthew/A-7653-2009; Brecic, Ruzica/G-1652-2018","Brečić, Ružica/0000-0003-3327-2187; Gorton, Matthew/0000-0002-4579-5092; Brecic, Ruzica/0000-0003-3327-2187; Barjolle, Dominique/0000-0001-5125-9686",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This article results from the FP7-research program FOCUS-BALKANS, GA 212579, co-ordinated by Dr Dominique Barjolle.

Although Hofstede's cultural dimensions served as an earlier benchmark for this argument, deeper research now permits a stand-alone model unique to Czech national culture. It centres on previous examinations that provide a working definition of the Czech management style in both theory and practice as foundation. Although many of the barriers to successful Knowledge Management are consistent across all cultures, reasons associated with culture are of a particular significance in this case. The attribute of 'Czechness' as the independent variable motivates general acceptance of what to many may consider as management fads or practices 'not made here'. As part of the on-going discussion on Czech culture, the authors re-introduce the notion of Svejk as the primary factor relative to Czech creativity and innovation and in general, the Czech management style in practice.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Content analysis of the transcripts of 31 semi-structured interviews conducted with parents of students from public and private institutions in Brazil. The public school provided meals supplied by the National School Feeding Program, and discouraged the consumption of foods brought from home. The private school did not receive any governmental subsidies for school feeding, and students were responsible for bringing their own school snacks. Findings - Parents perceived children's influence especially of energy-dense nutrient-poor food purchases. Parents from the public school students, with lower income and educational levels, showed greater concern with quality and frequency with which requested foods were made available to the child. Only the parents from the private school students mentioned perceiving peer influence over their children's requests. Research limitations/implications - Results enabled an overview of the main factors that influence children's purchase requests as perceived by parents. School environment seemed to influence requests, reinforcing the need for strategies similar to those present in the public school to be employed in private schools, where government programs that encourage healthy eating are not in place. Originality/value - Qualitative study conducted with parents of Brazilian school children found that those with lower income and educational level were actually more concerned about their children's eating habits and perceived less peer influence over their children's requests for foods. Initiatives in the public school environment that effectively reduced access to certain kinds of foods in favor of healthier food choices reinforced the school's role as a health promoter for students and also their families.","[Dallazen, Camila; Rataichesck Fiates, Giovanna Medeiros] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Nutr Post Graduat Program, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Fiates, GMR (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Nutr Post Graduat Program, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",gifiates@ccs.ufsc.br,"Fiates, Giovanna M R/K-6711-2013","Dallazen, Camila/0000-0002-9733-9486",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); CAPES,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors would like to thank National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), for financially supporting the work and for Coordination of Post-Graduate Studies (CAPES) for scholarship.",,48,8,10,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This was done to increase the availability of information on the effectiveness of these measures under local climate conditions. Natural ventilation alone limited the rise of temperature inside over the ambient (Delta T-max) to 2-4 degrees C, over a major part of the year. With 50% shading alone on top, the Delta T-max range was 6-11 degrees C over a major part of the year. With the two measures combined, the Delta T-max range was 1 to 3 degrees C. Natural ventilation was very effective due to (a) high wind speeds particularly in the afternoons, (b) the efficient configuration of vents (one on the ridge, and two on the sides) and (c) high vent area (total unscreened vent area was 25% of the floor). The actual measurement of the light intensity inside an experimental greenhouse with 50% shade net showed that it was still adequate for plant growth and shading could be increased by a further small amount. With these measures, the inside temperature could be kept close to the ambient over seven months. This may in part be the reason growers in the area increasingly prefer open-vent units with shade nets. Also, such units require low investment and have lower operational costs. Simulations also showed that fan pad cooling was required for at least five, possibly seven, months with several hours of operation each day to keep the inside close to 32 degrees C. In April, for instance, fan pad operation will span 10 h and consume 9.3 L m(-2) day(-1) of water. Water is scarce in the region and this may in part be the reason for the abandonment of fan-pad-cooled greenhouses some years ago. The information generated suggests that the expansion and sustainability of greenhouse cultivation in such a region calls for a designapproach different from that used for colder regions of the world. Here, full use should be made of shading and natural ventilation. More efficient evaporative cooling techniques such as fogging should be tried out, along with shade and ventilation. Although, not discussed here, cost-effective solar-powered brackishwater desalination would also be an integral part of sustainable greenhouses for semi-arid climates.","DA Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Grp Applicat ICT Agr, Gandhinagar 382007, India",Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information & Communication Technology,"Sharan, G (通讯作者)，DA Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Grp Applicat ICT Agr, Gandhinagar 382007, India.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,31,38,,,,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400002,0

Design/methodology/approach - In the first phase five trained food tasters evaluated the sensory quality of food. In the second phase, the analysis of the structure of employees was done by establishing their level of education, age and number of employees. In the third phase the regression and correlation analysis was done with the aim to establish the impact of the level of education, age and number of employees on the sensory quality of food. Findings - The sensory evaluation has shown that the evaluated food is of moderate quality. Correlation matrix has shown that the education level of employees has a high impact on the sensory quality of food. There is a correlation between the number of employees, their age and their education. Practical implications - Obtained results are the indicators of the quality of food in restaurants in the region and they can serve for the improvement of quality. They have shown that education and staff training can contribute to a better quality of food. Established methodology can also contribute to the practical evaluation of quality. Originality/value - This paper is reflected on the specific application of methodology of the sensory analysis of food in restaurants. The paper pointed to the impact of employees on the sensory quality of food by statistical methods. Statistical results which point to the great impact of the level of education of employees on the sensory quality of food in restaurants are particularly valuable.","[Tesanovic, Dragan; Kalenjuk, Bojana Miro; Portic, Milijanko] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Krasavcic, Milovan] Univ Belgrade, Coll Hotel Management, Dept Restaurant Business, Belgrade, Serbia; [Gagic, Snjezana] Alfa Univ, Coll Profess Studies Management & Business Commun, Sremski Karlovci, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Belgrade,"Kalenjuk, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",bojanakalenjuk@yahoo.com,,"Gagic Jarakovic, Snjezana/0000-0001-8940-552X",Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Republic of Serbia [III-046009],"Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",The authors are grateful to the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Republic of Serbia for sponsoring part of the study in project III-046009.,,54,4,5,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - An extensive literature review suggested hypotheses pertaining to the influence of food attributes on the different stages of the buying decision process of academic sojourners. With data from 139 international university students enrolled in a Spanish university, factorial principal component analyses and linear parametric regressions were conducted. Findings - Three factors underlie food attributes and influence all stages of the food purchase decision process: sustainable production, appearance and accessibility, and then flavor. The greatest influence occurs in the choice stage. Research limitations/implications - The sojourners exhibit a strong tendency to purchase products that reflect sustainable practices. Practical implications - Useful information about the influence of food attributes on purchasing decisions can support more effective decisions in food distribution channels, including coherent image strategies, enhanced new product development, and better communications to target the growing market of sojourners. Originality/value - This research contributes to the minimal empirical research pertaining to the role of food for international university students, and describes the influence of food attributes on purchase decisions.","[Tirelli, Christian] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Cuenca, Spain; [Pilar Martinez-Ruiz, Maria] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Area Comercializac & Invest Mercados, Castilla La Mancha, Albacete, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Martínez-Ruiz, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Area Comercializac & Invest Mercados, Castilla La Mancha, Albacete, Spain.",MariaPilar.Martinez@uclm.es,"Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/IUM-9361-2023; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/B-7200-2012","Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/0000-0002-5890-5174; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/0000-0002-5890-5174",Fundacion Carolina (Spain),Fundacion Carolina (Spain),This research was funded by Fundacion Carolina (Spain).,,122,11,13,1,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Its current unsustainable use highlights the need for sustainability policies. In order to explore potential policy strategies, we use the concepts of stocks and durable institutions as tools for analysing temporal structures in nature and society. These concepts are incorporated into a heuristic aimed at reducing complexity and finding windows of opportunity for policy action. The heuristic is applied to current German land-use policy. We show that the German government is highly unlikely to achieve its declared sustainability goal to reduce the rate of land conversion to 30 ha/day by 2020. Analysis of the inherent dynamics of major stocks and institutions reveals that, even in a situation with stagnating or declining population, the inertia of institutions such as local municipal self-administration and the municipal financial system prevents the government's sustainability goals from being achieved.

We introduce a new property, returns to scope, which is distinct from scale properties and does not rely on price information. Based on desirable characteristics of an estimator of returns to scope, we propose two methods for assessment. We present examples using simulated data and hospital production data from the 2008 National Inpatient Sample of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We find that hospitals experience negative returns to scope (productivity losses) from the joint production of minor and major diagnostic procedures. Based upon our results we conclude that the new returns to scope property allows sharper insights than classic economies of scope approaches.","[Pope, Brandon] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Johnson, Andrew] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Pope, B (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, 315 N Grant St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",popeb@purdue.edu,"Johnson, Andrew/B-7226-2012","Johnson, Andrew/0000-0003-3848-6977","Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [0944670] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",,,41,7,7,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This paper applies input-output (IO) analysis to evaluate water use and quantify virtual water transfers involving the two states. Results show that aquaculture requires the largest input of direct water per unit of economic output, followed by crops, power generation, livestock, mining, services, domestic, and industry. Low water use intensity industry and services sectors contributed the largest proportions of value added and employee compensation. In 2008, the two states were net virtual exporters, with CA exporting 1.3 times the net export volume of IL More than 72% of virtual water exports for each state originated from the high total water use intensity but low value added crops sector, with irrigation and rainfall contributing 99% and 97% of the crop-related exports for CA and IL, respectively. Virtual water export volumes were 59% for CA and 71% for IL when compared to actual water use. These results highlight the need to consider water use efficiency and opportunity cost when managing water under scarcity conditions.

This study develops a multinomial endogenous switching regression model of farmers' choice of combination of SAPs and impacts on maize income and agrochemicals and family labor use in rural Ethiopia. Four primary results were found. First, adoption of SAPs increases maize income and the highest payoff is achieved when SAPs are adopted in combination rather than in isolation. Second, nitrogen fertilizer use is lower in the package that contains system diversification and conservation tillage. Third, conservation tillage increased pesticide application and labor demand, perhaps to compensate for reduced tillage. However, when it is used jointly with system diversification, it does not have a significant impact on pesticide and labor use. Fourth, in most cases adoption of a package of SAPs increases women workload, suggesting that agricultural intensification technology interventions may not be gender neutral. This implies that policy makers and other stakeholders promoting a combination of technologies can enhance household food security through increasing income and reducing production costs, but need to be aware of the potential gender related outcomes.

This paper uses a spatially explicit resource extraction model to examine the impact of buffer zone size and management on extraction by local people, both legal and illegal, and the impact of that extraction on forest quality in the park's core and buffer zone. The results demonstrate trade-offs between the level of enforcement, the size of a buffer zone, and the amount of illegal extraction in the park; and describe implications for enrichment of buffer zones and evaluating patterns of forest degradation.

Drawing upon a database of 27 European countries, empirical evidence is found for the different roles of supply-side, demand-side and regulatory factors in encouraging the adoption of different types of eco-innovation. Our empirical strategy consists of the estimation of a trivariate probit model. Our results show that those entrepreneurs who give importance to collaboration with research institutes, agencies and universities, and to the increase of market demand for green products are more active in all types of eco-innovations. Supply-side factors seem to be a more important driver for environmental processes and organizational innovations than for environmental product innovations. The results also show that market share only has a significant positive influence on eco-product and eco-organizational innovations, while cost-savings are solely significant for eco-process innovations. Finally, prioritizing existing regulations shapes eco-product and eco-organizational innovations while expected regulations and access to subsidies and fiscal incentives do not have any significant effect on the decision to eco-innovate in Europe at the firm-level.

In this paper, we develop an ecosystem service approach to fill this research gap. We apply this approach to analysis of the Millennium Drought in the South Australian portion of the Murray-Darling Basin which provided a natural experiment for the economic estimation of hydrological ecosystem service losses. cataloguing estimates of expenditures incurred by Commonwealth and state governments, communities and individuals, we find that nearly $810 million was spent during the drought to mitigate losses, replace ecosystem services and adapt to new ecosystem equilibria. The approach developed here is transferable to other drought prone regions, providing insights into the potentially unexpected consequences of drought and ecosystem thresholds and socioeconomic and political tipping points after which ecosystem restoration may become very costly. Our application to the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin demonstrates the potential of this approach for informing water, drought preparedness and mitigation policy, and to contribute to more robust decision-making.

The authors use the Nash and Maxi-min stability definitions to analyze 25 two-by-two ordinal games, which they recognize as possible game-theoretic characterizations of climate negotiations between two players (e.g., Great Powers or coalitions of states). The authors' main conclusion that the Prisoner's Dilemma might not be the best description of climate negotiations game is consistent with the findings of others who have studied two-by-two conflicts over natural commons (Bardhan, 1993; Madani, 2010; Sandler, 1992; Taylor, 1987). Nevertheless, given the importance of the climate change issue, as well as the potential effects of our actions on the state of the environment and the well-being of future generations, I would like to address some gaps in their analysis, which result in it having limited usefulness for policy purposes. Of course, all models are simplified representations of reality, full of limitations. Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful (Box and Draper, 1987). So, the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful (Box and Draper, 1987). Models' limitations need to be carefully considered when interpreting them or applying their results to policy but some models are too simple to provide useful policy advice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is well known that a retailer is averse to sharing market information with a manufacturer due to concern for a manufacturer's strategic use of such information. This research shows that despite such strategic exploitation of market information, a retailer may want to establish information sharing channels with its supplier. Information sharing essentially shifts power upstream which, in turn, enhances the manufacturer's incentive to bear costs to boost retail demand: the manufacturer is induced to invest merely by knowing that information is on its way. Hence, the retailer benefits from information sharing ex ante despite the costly ex post exploitation by the manufacturer. This finding is a stark contrast to the most of previous results which consistently point out how bad it is for the manufacturer to have the retailer's demand information before setting prices. In fact, due to the investment effect, information sharing can lead to gains for the retailer, manufacturer, and consumers alike.","[Mittendorf, Brian] Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Shin, Jiwoong] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Yoon, Dae-Hee] Yonsei Univ, Yonsei Sch Business, Seoul 120749, South Korea",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Yale University; Yonsei University,"Shin, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, 135 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",mittendorf_3@fisher.osu.edu; jiwoong.shin@yale.edu; dae-hee.yoon@yonsei.ac.kr,"Mittendorf, Brian/C-9530-2012; Shin, Jiwoong/ABH-5883-2020","Mittendorf, Brian/0000-0002-5182-4240; Yoon, Dae-Hee/0000-0003-4298-2498",,,,,35,49,58,3,71,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Assigning economic values to the impacts of this decline can be very useful in overcoming economic-based objections to sustainable policies at all levels of government. However, economic valuations that are not based on sound scientific analysis threaten to undermine the credibility of ecological valuations in general and could also lead policy makers to misallocate the limited resources available for conservation efforts. Researchers at Cornell University have introduced a valuation into several peer-reviewed journals that asserts that each individual bird in the United States has an average economic value of $30, and they use this valuation to estimate the economic impact of various causes of bird mortality. The $30 valuation is explained with a single sentence that lacks any discernible scientific analysis and can at best be considered a symbolic valuation. While this valuation garnered widespread media attention, it creates a dangerous precedent and could ultimately do more harm than good to native bird populations. As such, further discussion of the role of symbolic valuations in the scientific literature is warranted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The institutional approach to the allocation of resources is emerging to supplement traditional analyses of market and government failures. The causes of these failures are many, but often point to high transaction costs that result largely from institutional impediments. Effective institutions can help reduce transaction costs through more effective signals and incentives, including information generation, to help markets function more efficiently and policies to be delivered more successfully. The study, which contributes to transaction costs measurement, finds that the magnitudes and types of transaction costs associated with setting up and implementing three greenhouse gas reduction policy programs in Australia are substantial and different. The estimated transaction costs of the Tradable Permit and Fee System are relatively high compared to those of the mandatory Fuel Label Program and the voluntary Fuel Efficiency Program, which supports the view that market-based policies can also be costly to deliver. Notwithstanding, transaction costs have frequently been ignored in cost-benefit analyses. It is concluded that transaction costs need to be considered alongside other costs and benefits in the assessment of policies. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

They need to be addressed by policy makers and they require changes in energy consumption. This study examines whether concerns about energy availability and climate change influence consumer behaviour, policy perceptions, and beliefs about future energy consumption. This question is investigated by analysing data from the Eurobarometer 75.4, a comprehensive survey of citizens from all countries of the European Union that was conducted in June 2011 (n = 26,840). The regression results show that people concerned about climate change were significantly more likely to take action to mitigate climate change, and to be more favourably disposed towards energy policies and future changes in energy consumption, than people who were not concerned about climate change. On the other hand, people who were concerned about energy availability undertook fewer actions and neither supported energy policies nor believed in future changes in energy consumption. This surprising finding raises questions regarding the adequate communication of energy availability and policies to the public in the European Union. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The model is based on a discrete-choice game between two types of supermarkets, and incorporates firm uncertainty arising from firm- and location-level private information as well as researcher uncertainty arising from location-level common information. Thus the model addresses the concern that firms' actions may be based on factors that are unobservable to the researcher, thus correlated conditional on observables. The estimates reflect a significant level of common information. Importantly, I find that ignoring unobserved location heterogeneity results in biased estimates of both the competitive effects and the effects of location-specific observables on profits. Counterfactual predictions are therefore misleading if unobserved location heterogeneity is unaccounted for.","Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Orhun, AY (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",aorhun@umich.edu,,"Orhun, A.

We find that genuine savings may have been negative up until c. 1910. This suggests a period of transition to positive genuine savings in conjunction with or even preceding the transition to modem economic rates. Important contributions to the transition were increasing investments in human capital, improved sanitary conditions, reduced depletion of forests and accelerated investments in machinery and infrastructure.

Design/methodology/approach - The author is interested in how voluntary disclosure of questionable business practices by chocolate manufacturers regarding child labor exploitation at cocoa plantations influences consumer behavior. A total of 120 students participated in an experimental study in which the author manipulated awareness of ethical issues in the chocolate industry and corporate disclosure strategy. The author measured willingness to pay (WTP) and consumer perceptions about the firm's commitment to corporate social responsibility. Findings - The study found that voluntary disclosure of unethical business practices by a firm was not damaging in terms of consumer perceptions. When public awareness was limited, disclosing participation in unethical behavior did not influence WTP for the firm's products. When public awareness was high, disclosing this negative information is even more beneficial than no disclosure and generates similar responses to including only positive elements in the firm's communication, provided that the firm commits to eliminate its unethical practices. Research limitations/implications - Voluntary negative social disclosure will not hurt a firm's performance in terms of sales, given the disclosure is transparent and this suggests a credible commitment to improve its practices regarding the issue. Originality/value - The author investigates the optimal strategy for a firm to disclose ethical infractions. She demonstrates that being open about them does not necessarily damage a firm's reputation and suggests under which conditions this is the case.","Univ Pompeu Fabra, GPEFM, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Aktar, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, GPEFM, Barcelona, Spain.",ipek.aktar@upf.edu,,,,,,,107,14,14,1,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The aim of this paper is to examine the export competitiveness of the canned tuna export industry in Thailand for 1996-2006. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) approach and calculates RCA indices for both major exporters in the world market and competitors in individual export markets. Findings - Thailand has comparative advantages in all major export markets; these have remained stable in the USA, the Middle East, Japan and Canada but have fallen substantially in Australia. Practical implications - First, Thailand urgently needs to consider tuna farming. Second, smaller processing and fishing companies should merge to increase profit margins and market share. Third, Thailand should engage in effective trade negotiations with importers. Fourth, stock management and conservation could be used to support the industry. It is unlikely that current levels of comparative advantage can be maintained because of import tariffs, rules of origin, labour shortages and increasing unskilled labour costs. Social implications - Tuna management and conservation in Thailand could be used to support the sustainability of the industry. Originality/value - By contrast to Kijboonchoo and Kalayanakupt who find that Thailand's market share declined between 1987-1998 and revealed comparative advantage fell, these results show that this declining trend has since been arrested.","[Kuldilok, Kulapa Supongpan] Kasetsart Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Dawson, P.

J,"Wiese, A; Toporowski, W",,,,"Wiese, Anne; Toporowski, Waldemar",,,CSR failures in food supply chains - an agency perspective,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corporate social responsibility; Supply chain management; Food industry; Failures; Agency theory,CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; QUALITY FADE,"Purpose - Companies implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices along their supply chains to fulfil stakeholder requirements. In doing so, failures in which CSR aspects are violated also emerge, caused by single supply chain members. In these situations, quite often the other supply chain members also appear responsible although they mostly do not have complete control over suppliers and sub-suppliers due to information gaps. Therefore, the malpractice of one single company can harm the reputation of related companies. This paper aims to analyse recent CSR failures along food supply chains with the aim of evaluating why these occurred and what possibilities exist to avoid similar failures in the future. Design/methodology/approach - Agency theory analyses information asymmetries in relationships in which one party delegates work to another party. In the considered failures, the downstream company can be regarded as principal by ordering products from the suppliers (agents). Consequently, agency theory contributes towards understanding failures in CSR implementation and highlighting solutions. Findings - The cases analysed illustrate that CSR failures can have negative impacts on the companies' reputation and therefore also financial effects. Implementing a successful CSR policy should therefore be a primary interest of companies. Agency theory proved suitable to illustrate supply chain relationships and point out implications for companies. The instruments of agency theory can help to avoid CSR failures in food supply chains. Originality/value - The paper combines agency theory with failures in CSR along food supply chains. In doing so, new insights into supply chain relationships are gained and implications for supply chain members to avoid CSR failures can be deduced. One special characteristic of the analysed failures is that the principal is not aimed at increasing the quantity of the agent's output but the quality.","[Wiese, Anne; Toporowski, Waldemar] Univ Gottingen, Chair Retailing, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Wiese, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Chair Retailing, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",awiese@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,36,43,49,3,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Production phases are explicitly divided into two activities; namely, the breed-to-farrow phase and the wean-to-finish phase. By using this model, the problem of shared inputs and dynamic intermediates among activities that characterize pig production are taken into account in an integrated framework, simultaneously with the consideration of non-zero slack, allowing us to examine aspects of production in a more comprehensive and factual manner. For the empirical results based on sample data from 2006 to 2007, it is shown that the overall technical inefficiencies obtained from DMNDEA are not obviously different from those obtained using a traditional one-stage model. However, the DMNDEA results explicitly show us that the sources of inefficiency for each farm are different. Furthermore, second-stage bootstrapping regression results reveal that the determinants of efficiency for each production phase are not the same, indicating the need to identify the influential factors for each production phase separately.","Chung Hua Univ, Dept Int Business, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",Chung Hua University,"Chen, PC (通讯作者)，Chung Hua Univ, Dept Int Business, 707,Sec 2,WuFu Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",pochi@chu.edu.tw,,,,,,,32,19,20,1,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The paper showed that simulated closure of large socio-economic gaps between blacks and whites did little to diminish prevailing high levels of residential segregation or otherwise enhance moves by black households to areas of educational, employment, and housing opportunity. Some two decades later and in the wake of significant urban evolution, this paper assesses anew racial variations in residential location choice. Results of the multinomial logit (MNL) analysis indicate large, persistent racial differentials in intrametropolitan residential location choice. While black location choice in 2000 was relatively more dispersed than in 1980, it remained remarkably concentrated in D.C. and Prince George's County. As in our prior analysis, results showed that large simulated gains in black economic and educational status had little effect on prevailing racial segregation. These findings underscore the ongoing, limited access of black households to schooling, employment, and homeownership opportunities available outside traditional areas of settlement. In marked contrast, the locational choices of Latino and immigrant households bore greater similarity to those of whites and were more sensitive to improvements in socio-economic status.","[Gabriel, Stuart A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA; [Painter, Gary D.] Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Southern California,"Gabriel, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plaza,Suite C412, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",sgabriel@anderson.ucla.edu; gpainter@sppd.usc.edu,,,,,,,15,6,8,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This definition naturally leads to TFP indexes that can be expressed as the ratio of an output quantity index to an input quantity index. If the aggregator functions satisfy certain regularity properties then these TFP indexes are said to be multiplicatively complete. This paper formally defines what is meant by completeness and reveals that (1) the class of multiplicatively complete TFP indexes includes Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher, Tornqvist and Hicks-Moorsteen indexes, (2) the popular Malmquist TFP index of Caves et al. (Econometrica 50(6):1393-1414, 1982a) is incomplete, implying it cannot always be interpreted as a measure of productivity change, (3) all multiplicatively complete TFP indexes can be exhaustively decomposed into measures of technical change and efficiency change, and (4) the efficiency change component can be further decomposed into measures of technical, mix and scale efficiency change.

Recent evidence calls into question the generality of the original findings, but the papers all raise the question: what mechanisms lie behind exploitation patterns in a trophic system? This paper develops a simple model that shows how economic factors drive patterns of exploitation in a trophic system. We show that while fishing down the food chain is possible, there is no reason to suppose that the relevant economic factors favor such an outcome. As we show, other patterns are just as plausible. We also discuss and show how an index of trophic level-weighted harvest is not necessarily a good indicator of ecosystem health if biomass abundance is important. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.

The model accounts for the links between phosphorus fertilization, crop yield, accumulation of soil phosphorus reserves, and phosphorus loading into waterways. It can be used to guide precision phosphorus management as a means to mitigate agricultural phosphorus loading. Erosion control is considered as an additional measure to reduce phosphorus loading through soil loss. A dynamic programming approach and numerical solution method are used to analyze the intertemporally optimal combination of fertilization and erosion control and the associated soil phosphorus development. The optimal fertilizer application rate changes markedly over time in response to changes in the soil phosphorus level. Erosion control was found to increase welfare only on land that is highly susceptible to erosion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Throughout their early history, the societies presented themselves as champions of home ownership among the working classes, but historians of housing have generally disputed the role that building societies played, or could have played, in extending home ownership before the First World War. The case study presented in this article shows that it was possible for a building society to lend to working-class borrowers, and that home ownership before the First World War was not beyond the grasp of such people. While it was undoubtedly an exception within the movement, the Co-operative Permanent Building Society showed a genuine commitment to working-class owner-occupation, providing the majority of its loans to both skilled and unskilled workers on easy repayment terms. How it was able to overcome the adverse selection and moral hazard risks involved in lending to such groups of people is the focus of this article.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Samy, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,,,,,29,11,12,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The starting point of the research is the seminal work of Michael Spence and his notion of signalling. Following research in this field has been aimed either at the employers' side (theory of screening) or at the side of prospective employees and their demand for education as the determinative signal. In the paper, I focus on the employees' side of the market. One of the purposes is to model the demand for education with the necessary respect to the informational characteristic of education. I start with a simple model combining basic motives to invest in education and expected results of that decision. The model is employed to demonstrate the demand for education and is combined with the utility function of education in one's lifetime. Finding the way how people decide about the amount of education they want to receive shows me the way to two basic theories of education.","[Bican, Vitezslav] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Microecon, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,v.bican@email.cz,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,137,149,,,,,,13,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500014,0

Recently, the density-based empirical likelihood technique was proposed and applied successfully to construct a powerful two-sample nonparametric likelihood ratio test based on samples entropy. However, while the problem of one-sided alternatives has received considerable attention in the case of the likelihood ratio tests, the two-sample density-based empirical likelihood test was proposed only in the context of the two-sided alternative. Hence, it is not suitable for a variety of applied statistical problems where the one-sided test should be driven by the scientific question and the data analyzed. In this paper we show how one-sample density-based empirical likelihood tests can be constructed and provide a proof of their consistency. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the proposed one-sided nonparametric tests have approximately same powers as that of the Wilcoxon test detecting a constant shift in the one-sided two-sample problem and are preferable to the Wilcoxon test detecting a nonconstant shift.","[Gurevich, Gregory] SCE Shamoon Coll Engn, IL-77245 Ashdod, Israel",,,gregoryg@sce.ac.il,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,425,435,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500040,0

With increasing load, crack tip collapse occurs instead of crack extension, and local yielding appears around crack tip not the whole ligament, which coincides with recent research that NSC (neck-section-collapse) overestimates structure loading capability. From the test results, a method based on J-P curves is used to estimate collapse loads for contact tension specimen with different crack length. Second, tension process of contact tension specimen is simulated by finite element method combining with Gurson model, which is proved to simulate structure plastic failure well. Then, Gurson model is adapted to simulate failure process of circumferential cracked pipeline made of S355 with internal pressure. Finally, relationship between crack length and collapse CMOD (crack mouth opening displacement) is built, which is important for integrity assessment of nuclear pipelines.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports the results of a survey of over 300 face-to-face interviews with shoppers of Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury - three of the major supermarkets in the UK. Findings - Product class involvement factors, individual characteristics, health-related factors (nutritional knowledge, health locus of control, perceived need of dietary change), situational, attitudinal and behavioral factors were found to be significant factors affecting the use of nutritional information and nutritional and health claims on food labeling. While the use of nutritional information and health claims increases with the stated importance of nutrition and family preferences, it is less likely among shoppers for whom taste is an important driver of food purchasing behaviour. There is also evidence of mistrust in health claims, as indicated by the negative relationship between the consideration of such claims and the stated importance of quality and perceived need to change dietary quality - the more discerning shoppers are the least likely to consider health claims. Originality/value - The study provides evidence that a wider range of product class involvement factors is necessary to predict the use of nutritional information and nutritional and health claims on food labeling. It also offers a conceptualization of health-related factors to include health locus of control as a predictor of the acquisition of nutrition and health information.","[Petrovici, Dan] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Fearne, Andrew] Univ Kent, Ctr Supply Chain Res, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Drolias, Dimitris] Div Res, Management Dev Serv, Peterborough, Cambs, England",University of Kent; University of Kent; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Petrovici, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England.",D.A.Petrovici@kent.ac.uk,"Petrovici, Dan/HGE-4975-2022","Petrovici, Dan/0000-0002-2688-5439",,,,,56,28,32,1,65,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The assumption of the applied parametric approach to the calculation of inequality measures is that wages of employees of the Slovak Republic are a result of stochastic processes based on a reasonably smooth probability distribution. Another assumption is that the applied model correctly analytically describes this distribution and therefore also the basic properties and structure of the empirical distribution of wages. Presented are the results of the analysis of various inequality measures evaluated in the model framework. Various approaches to probability modeling of wages are used while goodness-of-fit has the highest priority when choosing models of the distribution. The linearity of the pattern of points in a quantile -quantile plot (Q-Q plot) is a visualization of the goodness-of-fit line. The model chosen to interpret the data influenced the calculated single inequality statistic. A feature of the Q-Q plot constructed by displaying the order statistics is that the inequality measures can be obtained as least squares estimates of a Q-Q diagram. Tarsitano's applied approach is compared to the classical approach to the calculation of inequality measures of wages of employees in the Slovak Republic.,"[Sipkova, Lubica] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Stat, Fac Econ Informat, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,lubica.sipkova@euba.sk; juraj.sipko@uninova.sk,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,1032,1042,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500097,0

This paper deals with the control of an invasive species, void of market value, and acting as a space competitor for a valuable native harvested species. It presents a theoretical bioeconomic model describing the interacting dynamics of the two species and accounting for the undesirable consequences of native stock harvesters' behaviour on the spread of invasion. Dynamic optimisation of the model displays the existence of a time-path leading to an optimal stationary steady-state solution where the native species is sustainably harvested and the invasive species is kept under control, provided unit costs of native species harvesting and of invaded areas cleaning are quite low, natural and anthropogenic dispersal coefficients of invasion, and time-discount rate are moderate. Moreover, the problem should be addressed early enough. The model is applied to the Bay of Saint-Brieuc scallop fishery invaded by slipper-limpet. We show that it is nearly always optimal to control the invasion in that case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Two general conclusions can be drawn from the empirical results. First, the estimates obtained are consistent with an inverse U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve: air pollution releases increase with income up to a turning point where the relation reverts. Second, there is evidence that air releases tend to be higher in provinces with high concentration of females as households' head and with high concentration of children. Since our findings do not point to environmental discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, this suggests that environmental justice issues in Italy are not likely to manifest themselves along racial and ethnic terms but instead in terms of social categories and gender composition. We also find that the proxy variables employed to measure the efficiency or inefficiency of law enforcement are associated with higher levels of pollution. In terms of policy implications, this result suggests the need to strengthen, all through the country, the local enforcement of environmental laws in order to possibly reduce the negative effects on ambient air pollution.

Integrated assessment models are the main tools used to estimate the global economic benefits of policies that would address climate change, but these models typically include only a partial accounting and idiosyncratic treatment of ecosystem impacts. Here, we review several recent studies of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and show that the biodiversity value function in the FUND integrated assessment model is insensitive to predicted biodiversity loss, instead depending almost entirely on temperature changes per se. We use quantitative estimates of the influence of global warming on species extinction rates to re-calibrate the biodiversity loss function in FUND, and develop a new global biodiversity nonuse value function calibrated using results from two previous studies of people's willingness to pay to prevent the loss of tropical rainforests and to protect endangered species in the US. In contrast to the ecosystem damages function in FUND, our biodiversity value function depends on temperature only indirectly through its influence on biodiversity loss. Finally, we highlight areas where further research is needed for developing more comprehensive and reliable forecasts of ecosystem damages related to climate change.

The model is based upon actual patient characteristics from a physical therapy clinic within an urban health and wellness center situated in a public university. A number of reported patients' characteristics such as age, education level, distance from the clinic, historical attendance records, etc. were examined to determine if they significantly impacted the patients' missing scheduled appointments (no-shows.) Decision tree analysis was used to develop a model that assessed the likelihood of a patient's no-show, using key patient characteristics and attendance records. Such a model can be used to assist with scheduling patients in an outpatient clinic, while attempting to increase the clinic's overall utilization. Four tree growing criteria were examined to develop the model with the strongest predictive power. Predictive power of each method was assessed by using the entire dataset as well as using split sampling. The results were then compared with those of a Bayesian networks model and a neural networks model. In addition, the trade-off between the selected decision tree model's predictive power versus simplicity of the associated classification rules was examined. We also assessed the impact of various levels of overbooking on the clinic's utilization when using patients' schedules based on the predictive model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequently, we consider separately the four types of products which aggregate tobacco comprises (fine-cut tobacco, snuff, cigars, and cigarettes), and tentatively suggest that habit formation was a stronger factor on the persistence of consumption than physical addiction. The paper ends by showing that the introduction of the Bonsack machine in the early 1890s did not coincide with changes in the structure of the demand for tobacco, suggesting cost-driven technological change.","[Ciccarelli, Carlo; De Fraja, Gianni] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [De Fraja, Gianni] Nottingham Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [De Fraja, Gianni] CEPR, London EC1V 7DB, England",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Nottingham; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Ciccarelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",carlo.ciccarelli@uniroma2.it; defraja@economia.uniroma2.it,"De Fraja, Gianni/F-6719-2015","De Fraja, Gianni/0000-0001-6164-1002",,,,,72,7,7,1,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2014,8.0,2,,,,,145,171,,10.1007/s11698-013-0097-z,0.0,,,27,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AF4LJ,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000334683500001,0

First, we briefly revisit criticisms to the development discourse and then engage in deeper exploration of the status of its direct descendant: sustainable development (SD). Next, we consider the Latin-American position in the discursive field of SD and the situation of Buen vivir vis-a-vis SD. Drawing on the traditional repository of the continent's indigenous cultures, this discourse has been theorized in the academic sphere and translated into normative principles that have started to permeate the public, but also the political sphere, especially in Ecuador and Bolivia. In this article we refer to Buen vivir as the contemporary discursive reelaboration of the Quechua concept Sumak Kawsay and similar principles from other indigenous peoples. It includes both the idea of interdependence between society and nature and a conception of the universal as a plurality. Lastly, we outline some inbuilt tensions of the Buen vivir discourse, but also its dialogic potential with several variants of the heterogeneous discursive field around the idea of SD.

Our approach is employed to assess environmental performance in the emission of greenhouse gases in the European Union-28 over the period 1990-2011.

DEA models are also means of expressing appreciative democratic voices of DMUs. This paper proposes a methodology for allocating premium points to a group of professors using three models sequentially: (1) a DEA model for appreciative academic self-evaluation, (2) a DEA model for appreciative academic cross-evaluation, and (3) a Non-DEA model for academic rating of professors for the purpose of premium allocations. The premium results, called DEA results, are then compared with the premium points nurtured by the Dean, called N bonus points. After comparing DEA results and N bonus points, the Dean reassessed his initial bonus points and provided new ones - called DEA-N decisions. The experience indicates that judgmental decisions (Dean's evaluations) can be enhanced by making use of formal models (DEA and Non-DEA models). Moreover, the appreciative and democratic voices of professors are virtually embedded in the DEA models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We discuss new advances in the measurement of water fluxes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This empirical knowledge will enable us to develop inenterprise practices and resource-management policies to protect water quantity and water quality across our diverse landscapes. The need for precise irrigation guidelines is acute, in particular where shortage in fresh water resources is escalating. Irrigation can be a sustainable practice, however, poor irrigation management practices cause environmental problems. Irrigation recommendations in arid and semi-arid environment generalize to irrigate frequently, however, such generalization is not adequate. Alternatively an accurate estimation of soil water content and plant water use are critical to develop specific irrigation recommendations and guidelines. The use of real-time monitoring (10-min interval between field measurements) will assist in scheduling the irrigation system and preventing salt accumulation to a level which exceeds the threshold of the particular plant. Such systems are ideal for efficient in-situ field monitoring of soil salinity with minimal disturbance to the soil profile. At a selected depth, sensors can monitor salinity with high accuracy over a long period of time. Plant monitoring instruments can specifically target three fundamental areas of plant science: water use, water stress and growth rates. Stem psychrometers offer significant benefits over more common leaf hygrometers to measure the plant water potential, through the ease of attachment which minimizes energy balance disruptions that in turn improves measurement accuracy. A complete solution for weather and environmental monitoring has to be installed so that we can account for the evapotranspiration (ET) and develop a model to enable us to schedule the irrigation system. These techniques allow us to measure plant-effective water streams. Sensors are very useful for the calibration and validation of water-balance models which in return can save water by up to 38% when using the direct innovative technology.","ICT Int, Armidale, NSW, Australia",,"Abu Rumman, GA (通讯作者)，ICT Int, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,13,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,169,174,,,,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400019,0

Design/methodology/approach - A number of methods including: mapping of outlets relative to schools; sampling food; gathering data on secondary school food policies; observing food behaviour in fast food outlets and focus groups with young people. Findings were were fed back to a committee consisting of representatives from nutrition, public health, planning services and local community groups. Findings - There are concentrations of fast-food outlets near schools and students reported use of these, including stories of skipping lunch in order to save money and eat after school at these outlets. Food from fast-food outlets was high in fat, saturated fat and salt, but these are not the only source of high such foods, with many of the students reporting buying from shops near the school or on the way to or from school. At lunchtime food outlets were less likely to be used by school students in areas near schools that have a closed gate policy. Research limitations/implications - The snapshot nature of the research limited what can be said about the food behaviours of the children outside school hours. Practical implications - The local policy context requires action to improve both the food offered in schools and the immediate environment around the school in order to tackle fast-food and other competitive foods on offer outside the school. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies in the UK to systematically map fast food outlets around schools and explore what might be done. This research shows how it is possible to link the findings of local research and develop local responses from both public health and local authority planning perspectives. The research moves away from a mere documenting of problems to devising integrated public health solutions. The findings show how public health and planning services can work together to the mutual benefit of each other.","[Caraher, M.] City Univ London, Sch Community & Hlth Sci, Ctr Food Policy C310, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Lloyd, S.] City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, Sch Community & Hlth Sci, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Madelin, T.] NHS Tower Hamlets, London, England",City University London; City University London,"Caraher, M (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Sch Community & Hlth Sci, Ctr Food Policy C310, London EC1V 0HB, England.",m.caraher@city.ac.uk,,,Tower Hamlets Primary Care Trust,Tower Hamlets Primary Care Trust,This work was supported by funding from Tower Hamlets Primary Care Trust.,,50,16,17,2,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The intention is to understand how the consumption of technological devices transforms eating practices, and how the meanings of family quality time are continuously evolving through the consumption of mobile media devices. Design/methodology/approach - Insights are drawn from two independent, ethnographic studies that adopted an interpretive approach which employed multiple methods, including 63 visual diaries; 40 written diaries; observations in schools, homes, and Sikh temples (73 items observed), and 66 in-depth interviews. Both studies involved children, aged between 13 and 17 years within the UK, and were conducted for a period of over 12 months each. Informants were recruited through interaction with schools, Sikh temples and the Sikh community. Findings - The findings reveal interplay between family quality time, and the consumption of technological devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, ipods and their associated application packages. Of particular interest is how these devices transfer cultural meanings surrounding family mealtime interactions. The paper uncovers how family quality time is altered and evolved in form, but not ultimately abandoned, and argues that the pervasive nature of technology at mealtimes has implications into food cultures and identity. Originality/value - The encroachment of media devices on the food environment has often been described with negativity. However, this study tells a different, yet positive tale about transformations in social institutions such as the family and the school as a consequence of the consumption of technological devices at mealtimes.","[Chitakunye, Pepukayi] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Management IT & Governance, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Takhar, Amandeep] Univ Bedfordshire, Sch Business, Luton, Beds, England",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Bedfordshire,"Chitakunye, P (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Management IT & Governance, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",pepukayi.chitakunye@wits.ac.za,,,,,,,64,9,11,0,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

J,"Díaz-Méndez, C; Callejo, J",,,,"Diaz-Mendez, Cecilia; Callejo, Javier",,,Homogenization of eating times in the United Kingdom and Spain,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Globalisation; Food; Time; Food consumption,,"Purpose - The paper aims to offer information regarding the degree of homogenization of eating times in the UK and Spain. The objective is to compare two societies by the ways their respective members organize the time spent on eating. Eating time organization is examined via two parameters: eating rhythms and their duration. The authors study the former by comparing daily meals timetables. Duration is studied via the time spent on eating and cooking. Design/methodology/approach - Data from time-use surveys in Spain and the UK have been used for this work and various specific aspects of eating have been analyzed. First we consider the time devoted to eating; second, the timetables of the main intakes: third, the time spent cooking. Since in these sections it is noted that eating out is the behavior that most differentiates Spaniards and Britons, another section is given specifically to analyzing this behavior. Four categories were established by using a scaled variable to collect the time when the main activity is eating out: Home consumption, which shows are those that do not spend time eating or drinking out. Short time eating out: those who spend half an hour at most eating or drinking out. Average time eating out: those who spend between half an hour and one hour eating or drinking out. Long time eating out: those who spend more than an hour eating or drinking out. The comparison was made using respective sub-samples limited by age, between 16 and 65, as this is the potentially active population, integrated into the labor market in both countries. Findings - British and Spanish timetables do not coincide. The British spread their important meals through the day, while Spaniards concentrate them between 1.30 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon (lunch) and between 8.30 and 11 o'clock in the evening (dinner). In the Spanish case this makes for important peaks of individuals eating at the same time: in the periods 2:20/2:30 and 21:10/21:20. In the UK they are spread more throughout the day and do not reach comparable maximums. In Spain an average of 20 minutes (23.2 minutes) more is spent on the main meals than in the UK. This difference is found mainly among those who eat at home. Differences in eating out are quite smaller for Britain and Spaniards. They make a greater collective effort to synchronize this activity and, therefore, to a greater extent the day's structure. In both societies an eating norm shared by their members that reproduces cultural aspects characteristic of each one is maintained. The evaluation of eating is in the time and place of meals. In the British case, compared with the Spanish one, there is a greater tendency to eat out and spend little time, without taking into account comparison with time spent going home to eat. This tendency points to a lesser value being given to the practice. If to this factor we add the differences in time both societies devote to cooking, longer in the Spanish one, the different nature of the social act of eating has in each society is highlighted. Practical implications - Time analysis offers a new dimension to the exploration of the homogenization of food consumption. Other types of data used to establish international comparisons on food, especially data on food consumption, show a homogeneous image of food consumption among countries.

It can also help to improve the design of these kinds of greenhouse while enhancing the radiation transmission inside. This study is an essential prerequisite for research on crops, namely those adapted to specific conditions in greenhouses equipped with photovoltaic panels. With this context in mind, the solar radiation distribution, thermal air, water vapour and dynamics fields were simulated using the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model in two types of greenhouses (Asymmetric and Venlo) equipped with photovoltaic panels on their roof, as well as crop cover characteristics and the interactions between crops and airflow. A detailed description of the thermal, dynamic and radiation fields inside the greenhouse was obtained and the analysis of data collected during this study shows that (i) solar radiation is more evenly distributed in the Venlo greenhouse than in the Asymmetric greenhouse. On an average, the solar radiation transmission in the Asymmetric greenhouse is 41.6% whereas that of the Venlo greenhouse is 46%. These luminosity values are not well adapted to plant requirements. (ii) For the same boundary conditions, the Venlo greenhouse has a cooler climate than the Asymmetrical greenhouse (-3 degrees C in summer and -3 degrees C in winter). This effect is beneficial in summer, but not in winter. The various different openings in the Venlo greenhouse help to maintain temperature control and a homogeneous climate (temperature variation of 5 degrees C in summer and 3.3 degrees C in winter).","[Fatnassi, H.; Poncet, C.; Brun, R.; Muller, M.

Design/methodology/approach - Household budget survey data from Italy, the UK, France and Ireland (1985-2005) have been analysed comparing average food budgets and change in coefficient of variations for common food groupings and through cluster analysis for all four countries to determine whether or not countries are becoming more or less alike. Findings - Unlike the average food budgets in Ireland, the UK and France, Italian food budgets are still made up of a high percentage of foods to prepare and eat at home, similar to food budgets in the other countries for socio-demographic groups that either have chosen to eat traditionally or cannot afford to eat out (food poverty households). Modern households within France, the UK and Ireland are spending a higher percentage on foods away from home with some households, specifically those with a head of household who is young, employed and single, spending, on average, two-thirds of their household food budget dining away from home. Originality/value - Previous research into convergence theory has generally analysed national summary level data. This research uses household level data, allowing for both an analysis of convergence across countries and within countries, specifically looking at socio-demographic groups that share similar food budgets and food lifestyles.","Univ Limerick, Dept Sociol, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Healy, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Dept Sociol, Limerick, Ireland.",Amy.Healy@ul.ie,"Healy, Amy Erbe/HTS-6610-2023","Healy, Amy Erbe/0000-0003-3354-1519",,,,,26,6,7,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on two research reviews conducted in 2013 and 2014. Findings - Whilst it is possible to draw important insights into key drivers of food aid use, how food aid is draw on by recipients and some of the perceived outcomes of the provision from the research that is available, ultimately the reviews highlight the emergent and largely unsystematic nature of the UK evidence base. The lack of agreed definitions and measures of food insecurity/food poverty further limits the knowledge base. Even where such evidence may be forthcoming, in terms of implementing effective solutions to the need for food aid, UK researchers, policy makers, NGOs and others face considerable challenges in terms of identifying responsibilities for addressing the causes of this need, which the most effective scale for response may be (local or national) and finally, overcoming a highly complex and not necessarily co-ordinated policy framework.

Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments are conducted in this paper to examine the influence of different food product types and the VS-mood state relationship. Findings - The results are consistent with the author's hypotheses and indicate that happy people incorporate more VS when healthful and unfamiliar food products are offered, while sad people incorporate more VS when hedonic and familiar food products are offered. Practical implications - Marketers of leading brands selling hedonic food products could cultivate positive emotions in their target consumers in order to prevent them from switching brands. Conversely, marketers of follower brands may find it appropriate to induce negative moods in their consumers to encourage brand switching. For those marketers who sell less hedonic, healthier food products, marketing strategies should be contrary to those for hedonic food products. In addition, marketers may conduct strategies to prevent consumers from feeling sad in the case of products with a low market profile and which are unfamiliar to their consumers. They could cultivate happy moods in consumers to encourage them to make more varied food product choices. Originality/value - Prior research has focussed mainly on hedonic and familiar products when explaining VS behavior, but the present research has demonstrated the need to discuss different product types, such as healthful and unfamiliar products, in order to obtain a broader understanding of affective states on VS.","Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Adult & Continuing Educ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan Normal University,"Lin, HC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Adult & Continuing Educ, Taipei, Taiwan.",hungchoulin@ntnu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-241-002],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from National Science Council of Taiwan under Grant NSC 100-2410-H-241-002.,,39,4,4,2,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The population of predators on all crops was the highest with an increasing rate of 0.222X and r(2)=0.93 which indicated that there was 93% variation in the population of predators by weeks. A positive and highly significant correlation was observed between the population and dates (r=0.96). Thereafter, the population of predators decreased on 30 April with a decreasing rate of -0.345X and r(2)=0.99. It further showed that there was a highly significant correlation between population and dates (r=0.99). The comparative population of predators indicated that it was maximum (1.72) on cauliflower, followed by potato (0.87), tomato (0.65) and turnip (0.38), respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the predator population varied significantly with different crops (F=2.61 df=3, P < 0.05). The data showed that there was a positive and highly significant correlation between temperature and the population of C. carnea through an in situ plant count method (r=0.668). The correlation of humidity with the population of C. carnea was negative and non-significant (r=-0.122). It may be concluded that the population density of C. carnea was more on cauliflower plants and in the field. It can be utilized in the integrated pest management in cauliflowers.","[Mari, J.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between food and nostalgia in order to find out in which way they affect each other. Design/methodology/approach - In order to explore the perspectives of traditional food in re-collecting and re-experiencing positive past experiences, both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used in two stages. First, focus group interviews were conducted with ten restaurant chefs in three different regions of Croatia. Then, a survey was carried out with 362 Croatian consumers. Findings - Focus group results show that although traditional food creates new opportunities for differentiation, finding the right ingredients and time for cooking traditional food is still a problem. There is a low interest in traditional food in restaurants, as domestic patrons mostly worry about the high prices, while foreign ones do not know anything about such foods due to the inadequate promotion of Croatian gastronomic offer. Survey results indicate that consumers are familiar with traditional Croatian food, eat it regularly at home and consider it as food with high-quality aspects that reminds them of their childhood and positive past experiences. Practical implications - The results presented in this paper give some directions for subjects involved in the manufacturing industry, tourism, the restaurant industry, etc. to devise ways of reminding their customers of childhood memories, family ties, etc. Originality/value - A relatively small number of food-centred studies are directly concerned with nostalgia. Many more studies investigate food in social changes, related to ethnic elements, etc. Considering an extensive literature review, and the analysis of data in the qualitative and quantitative study, this paper addresses two multidimensional and complex concepts which are powerful predictors of customer satisfaction.","[Renko, Sanda] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Trade, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Bucar, Kristina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Tourism, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Renko, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Trade, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",srenko@efzg.hr,"Bučar, Kristina/AAJ-6934-2020; Bucar, Kristina/AAY-4377-2021; GARCIA, SERGIO ERICK/X-9320-2018; Soucie, Sanda/P-9187-2016","Bučar, Kristina/0000-0002-0920-0661; Soucie, Sanda/0000-0002-9529-7534",,,,,75,30,32,2,51,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In summer this will operate very well, although broad shadow stripes can result in growth and yield differences. In winter, the amount of sunlight is further limited by the solar panels and will result in further reduction of light access to the cultivation space. As a result, the crops will suffer from growth problems. These drawbacks are eliminated by the application of Concentrating Power Systems (CSP) with Fresnel lenses. A Fresnel lens works like a normal lens but is much thinner. When the sun shines, the lens receives both direct and indirect sunlight. The lens will concentrate all direct sunlight, which can be collected as thermal energy in the focal point. This absorbed radiation can be converted with an absorption cooler or Thermo Acoustic Stirling Machine (TASM) into cold water for cooling. This cold water can cool the greenhouse without the need of water use. The indirect solar radiation, the diffuse light, will not focus and is therefore available as a fairly constant light source in the building or in the greenhouse. The capture of all direct radiation at high intensities will diminish the incoming heat load, which is useful for better internal climate control of greenhouses and buildings. This lower heat load makes it easier to keep the greenhouse cool with the absorber cooler or TASM. In this study the details of energy flows and thermal conversion with an absorption cooler or TASM were determined. Calculations showed a 47% heat load reduction (from 337 to 157 W/m(2)) with the Fresnel lenses in the covering of the greenhouse. In the case of the collector in focus, only 48% of the captured direct radiation, available as thermal energy, was required to cool the greenhouse further with an absorption cooler or TASM. The possibility of light regulation is an important advantage the Fresnel lenses have. The light amount can vary between 15-77% of the incoming radiation. The excess of the energy generated can be used for extra illumination (light and energy regulation) and/or energy supply and/or a desalination system.","HAN Univ Appl Sci, NL-6802 CE Arnhem, Netherlands",,"Sonneveld, P (通讯作者)，HAN Univ Appl Sci, POB 2217, NL-6802 CE Arnhem, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,55,61,,,,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400005,0

The model is based on a combination of tools for multi-attribute decision-making with the approaches of decision-making under risk; the model uses a subjective probability distribution of risk factors, decision matrices, scenarios and Monte Carlo simulation.","[Svecova, Lenka; Fotr, Jiri] Univ Econ, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Svecová, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchille Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",lenka.svecova@vse.cz; jiri.fotr@vse.cz,"Švecová, Lenka/AAE-5194-2021","Švecová, Lenka/0000-0002-0329-2921",,,,,10,0,0,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1546,1554,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700151,0

To describe the air flow around the sampler the potential flow of incompressible fluid model was used. The particle motion equations were integrated into the given velocity field. The aspiration efficiency was investigated as a function of a particle diameter at various values of wind velocity. It is shown that the gravity influence becomes considerable at low wind velocity and the aspiration efficiency decreases due to the particle deposition on the sphere surface.

We present novel data that allow us to account for both the quantity of installed machine tools and their technological type. Hitherto, comparison of productive technologies has been limited to case studies and well-worn narratives about US mass production and European-style flexible specialization. Our data show that the two countries in fact employed similar types of machines combined in different ratios. Furthermore, neither country was locked in a rigid technological paradigm. By 1945 Germany had converged on the US both in terms of capital-intensity and the specific technologies employed. Capital investment made a greater contribution to output growth in Germany, whereas US growth was capital-saving. Total factor productivity growth made a substantial contribution to the armaments boom in both countries. But it was US industry, spared the war's most disruptive effects, that was in a position to take fullest advantage of the opportunities for wartime productivity growth. This adds a new element to familiar explanations for Germany's rapid catch-up after 1945.","[Ristuccia, Cristiano Andrea] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ & Trinity Hall, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Tooze, Adam] Yale Univ, Dept Hist, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Cambridge; Yale University,"Ristuccia, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ & Trinity Hall, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,58,7,7,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Employers argued that female employment increased opportunities for men to advance; however, most male clerks regarded this expansion of the labour supply as a threat to their pay and status. This article examines the effects of female employment on male clerks using data from Williams Deacon's Bank covering a period 25 years prior to and 25 years subsequent to the initial employment of women. It is shown that, within position, women were substitutes for younger men, but not for senior men. In addition, the employment of women in routine positions allowed the bank to expand its branch network, creating new higher-level positions, which were almost always filled by men.","[Seltzer, Andrew] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Seltzer, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Econ Hist, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Seltzer, Andrew] Cornell Univ, Inst Compensat Studies, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of London; Australian National University; Cornell University,"Seltzer, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England.",,,"Seltzer, Andrew/0000-0002-9826-7082",,,,,37,4,5,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

To examine the factors that might induce environmental technological innovation, we focus on ISO 14001, a voluntary approach to environmental management, and scrutinise how the proficiency or maturity level of ISO 14001 in facilities influences environment-related research and development (R&D) expenditures that promote environmental technological innovation. We measure the maturity level based on the length of time since a given facility adopted ISO 14001. Using Japanese facility-level data from Environmental Policy Tools and Firm-Level Management and Practices: An International Survey (OECD Survey), we estimate two Tobit models by addressing an endogeneity issue in ISO 14001. The estimation results provide empirical evidence that as the ISO 14001 is improved in facilities, those facilities are likely to spend more on environmental R&D. The facility age and market concentration also positively affect environmental R&D. These findings suggest that the maturity level of ISO 14001 is an important factor influencing the investment in environmental R&D. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study attempted to measure the value of the forest on the quality of water resources from a contingent market, namely drinking water supply, by estimating variations in drinking water costs as a function of variations in land uses. Spatial correlations were taken into account because of the use of different geographical scales (i.e., water service area and land uses) and the potential existence of organizational and technological spillovers between water services. We found a significant negative effect of forest land use on water costs. We found no evidence of spatial spillovers concerning the management regime but did find that factors related to the scarcity of resources in neighboring water services have an impact on water costs.

Stochastic dynamic programming is applied to investigate when and to what extent a society should engage in efforts to reduce the likelihood of an invasion, to control and eradicate a newly established population, and to adapt to damages. The framework is parameterized for a potential Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) invasion in the warm water discharge area of a nuclear power plant planned on the northern shores of the Baltic Sea. The sensitivity analysis reveals three distinct strategies: an adaptive strategy, which reduces the damage that an existing invasive species population causes to the private sector; a preventive strategy, which delays the invasion and the resulting damage; and a mitigative strategy, which puts effort into timely detection, control and eradication of the newly established population. Choice of the optimal strategy is sensitive to the unit costs and effectiveness of the measures required, to the level of externalities and to the size of the clam population after the invasion has been detected. The results emphasize the need for the energy sector to identify and internalize the external costs of potential invasions when making any large-scale investment plans. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on the literature, we model the role of social norms with reference to age profile, ethnicity and geographical location of the reference group. Using English local authority data, we show that a social norm for recycling does exist. We find the expected relationship between the quality of kerbside provision and recycling activity, if the household derives warm-glow from the activity; however, it is insignificant. Amongst the control variables, we find evidence that multifamily dwellings recycle less. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This is likely due to the presence of incentives provided by the new accounting disclosure regime. Our results remain robust in terms of a sector analysis, firm size, and the introduction of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) across the three countries. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To better understand energy security and sustainability concerns, this study's main objective is to present an energy security index which measures national performance on energy security overtime. Based on three years of research involving interviews, surveys, and an international workshop, this study conceptualizes energy security as consisting of the interconnected factors of availability, affordability, efficiency, sustainability, and governance. It then matches these factors with 20 metrics comprising an energy security index, measuring international performance across 18 countries from 1990 to 2010. It offers three case studies of Japan (top performer), Laos (middle performer), and Myanmar (w]orst performer) to provide context to the index's results. It then presents four conclusions. First, a majority of countries analyzed have regressed in terms of their energy security. Second, despite the near total deterioration of energy security, a great disparity exists between countries, with some clear leaders such as Japan. Third, tradeoffs exist within different components of energy security. Fourth, creating energy security is as much a matter of domestic policy from within as it is from foreign policy without.
