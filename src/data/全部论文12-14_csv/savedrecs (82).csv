We study the impact of body weight report cards in Mexico. The report cards increased parental knowledge and shifted parental attitudes about children's weight. We observe no meaningful changes in parental behaviors or children's body mass index. Interestingly, parents of children in the most obese classrooms were less likely to report that their obese child weighed too much relative to those in the least obese classrooms. As obesity rates increase, reference points for appropriate body weights may rise, making it more difficult to lower obesity rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Applying the output adjustment model and the price adjustment model as well as nonnegative matrices theory we find that if the matrix of intermediate output (or input) coefficients has at least one non-final (or non-initial) class then (i) an adjustment of output system enables the final output rates of whole or part sectors corresponding to the non-final classes to rise, the input multipliers of whole Or part sectors corresponding to the non-final classes to decrease, and all other sectoral final output rates and input multipliers to be fixed, which is one kind of Pareto improvement of the economic system; (ii) the adaptation of price system enables the value-added rates of whole or part sectors corresponding to the non-initial classes to rise, the output multipliers of whole or part sectors corresponding to the noninitial classes to decrease, and all other sectoral value-added rates and output multipliers to be unchanged, which is another kind of Pareto improvement of the economic system. We respectively give a sufficient condition for the two kinds of Pareto improvements. A numerical example verifies these results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from a British cohort study, we address this gap by exploiting exogenous variation in local labour market characteristics to instrument for family income. We estimate the causal effect of family income on different measures of child health and explore the role of potential transmission mechanisms. We find that income has a very small but significant causal effect on subjective child health and no significant effect on chronic health conditions, apart from respiratory illnesses. Using the panel structure, we show that the timing of income does not matter for young children. Moreover, our results provide further evidence that parental health does not drive a spurious relationship between family income and child health. Our study implies that financial transfers are unlikely to deliver substantial improvements in child health. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"O'Mahony, JF; Paulden, M",,,,"O'Mahony, James F.; Paulden, Mike",,,"NICE's Selective Application of Differential Discounting: Ambiguous, Inconsistent, and Unjustified",VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,differential discounting; mifamurtide; NICE threshold,DECISION-MAKING; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREFERENCES; STERN,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recently recommended differential discounting of costs and health effects in the economic appraisal of health care interventions in certain circumstances. The recommendation was published in an amendment to NICE's Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal. The amendment states that differential discounting should be applied where treatment effects are both substantial in restoring health and sustained over a very long period (normally at least 30 years). Renewed interest in differential discounting from NICE is welcome; however, the recommendation's selective application of differential discounting raises a number of concerns. The stated criteria for applying differential discounting are ambiguous. The rationale for the selective application of differential discounting has not been articulated by NICE and is questionable. The selective application of differential discounting leads to several inconsistencies, the most concerning of which is the lower valuation of health gains for those with less than 30 years remaining life expectancy, which can be interpreted as age discrimination. Furthermore, the discount rates chosen by NICE do not appear to be informed by recent advances in the theoretical understanding of differential discounting. NICE's apparent motivation for recommending differential discounting was to ensure a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio for a pediatric oncology drug. While flexibility may be appropriate to allow some interventions that exceed conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds to be adopted, the selective adjustment of appraisal methods is problematic and without justification.","[O'Mahony, James F.] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Paulden, Mike] Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment THETA Coll, Toronto, ON, Canada",Trinity College Dublin; University of Toronto,"O'Mahony, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 2-4 Foster Pl, Dublin 2, Ireland.",jfomahon@tcd.ie,"Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016","Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980; O'Mahony, James/0000-0003-3414-7388",,,,,20,27,28,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17,5.0,,,,,493,496,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.014,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128041.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700002,0

In the context of health, there is, therefore, growing interest in understanding how measures of health-related quality of life relate to subjective well-being and whether subjective well-being could provide a basis for resource allocation decisions in the future. This study investigates the relationship between health-related quality of life, as measured by the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire, and subjective wellbeing in Parkinson's disease. Methods: A paper questionnaire including the EQ-5D questionnaire, four key subjective well-being questions taken from the Integrated Household Survey in England, and other demographic details was distributed to people with Parkinson's disease in the United Kingdom. Responses were used to estimate multiple regression models explaining subjective well-being using the EQ-5D questionnaire index (UK weights), EQ-5D questionnaire dimensions and the visual analogue scale, and patients' sociodemographic characteristics. Results: A total of 199 responses were received. Combining visual analogue scale and EQ-5D questionnaire dimensions, especially anxiety/depression and, to a lesser extent, mobility, yielded the best-fitting models (adjusted R-2 range 0.36-0.53). Patients with Parkinson's disease living in care homes report lower levels of subjective well-being than do those living alone. These effects are not captured by the health-related quality-of-life measures in the analysis. Conclusions: Usual health-related quality-of-life measures can partially explain different well-being dimensions, yet they fail to capture part of the broader impact of disease on subjective wellbeing. Further empirical research into the relationship between subjective well-being and the EQ-5D Parkinson's disease longitudinally, and in different disease areas, is required, and further standardization of subjective well-being measures is recommended.","[Cubi-Molla, Patricia] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England; [de Vries, Jane] GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, London, England",City University London; GlaxoSmithKline,"Cubí-Mollá, P (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Sch Arts & Social Sci 0309, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",p.cubi-molla@city.ac.uk,"Cubi-Molla, Patricia/K-4973-2015; Devlin, Nancy/M-3816-2014","Cubi-Molla, Patricia/0000-0002-2803-7337;",annual programme grant the Office of Health Economics from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry,annual programme grant the Office of Health Economics from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry,"We thank Parkinson's UK, in particular Lubna Arif-Schmitt, for granting its consent for this study, and to the members who kindly completed the questionnaires and provided such a warm welcome at their local meetings.

We collected data from a contingent valuation (CV) exercise conducted in two waves (fall and winter) to examine whether individual WTP varied across periods that differed in the predominance of fatal accidents. Risk valuations were based on fatal snow avalanche accidents, that is, a type of risk with seasonal differences in occurrence. We found slightly lower but statistically significant mean WTP figures in the winter than in the fall sample because of time-varying individual risk attitudes and, therefore, recommend controlling for these factors in risk assessment CV surveys.

We first illustrate that a sequential version of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm with worker-proposing may not find a worker-optimal quasi stable matching. Then, we provide a modified DA algorithm in which (i) each worker simultaneously proposes to his most preferred firm that has not rejected him and (ii) each firm chooses its acceptable workers from the cumulative set of workers who have ever proposed to it, assuming that the other workers proposing to its rival firms are hired. We show that this algorithm finds a worker-optimal quasi stable matching. We also show that this algorithm can be generalized into a fixed point algorithm.

We argue that social welfare ought to be computed as the average individual utility instead of the average household utility as in most known criteria. We provide dominance criteria which allow for some indeterminacy about the average optimal family size, by resorting to the bounded approach to dominance analysis proposed by Fleurbaey et al. (2003). Indeed, when differences in needs come from family size, a specific population allocation problem (how a population should be optimally divided over families for given resources) adds to the usual income allocation problem. Pro-family and anti-family stances are introduced in order to make explicit the choice of an optimal family size. An application to French data shows that shifting from the household to the individualistic point of view can substantially alter the outlook of dominance results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An econometric framework using simultaneous equation models is developed to analyse the interrelated decisions on the intensity and type of health care use and private insurance. The framework is applied to the context of the mixed public private system in Australia. The simulation projections show that reducing premium subsidies is expected to generate net cost savings. This arises because the cost savings achieved from reducing subsidies are larger than the potential increase in public expenditure on hospital care. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In healthcare, this is a key policy issue, because of the potential cost savings and quality improvements from 'big data' in the form of sharing electronic patient data across medical providers. Indeed, one criterion used for federal subsidies for healthcare information technology is whether the software has the capability to share data. We find empirically that larger hospital systems are more likely to exchange electronic patient information internally, but are less likely to exchange patient information externally with other hospitals. This pattern is driven by instances where there may be a commercial cost to sharing data with other hospitals. Our results suggest that the common strategy of using 'marquee' large users to kick-start a platform technology has an important drawback of potentially creating information silos. This suggests that federal subsidies for health data technologies based on 'meaningful use' criteria, that are based simply on the capability to share data rather than actual sharing of data, may be misplaced.

We explore the random timing of the insurance rollout generated by the stepped wedge cluster-randomized design to evaluate the welfare and health impact of the insurance program. Our results suggest that the insurance had limited effects on average out-of-pocket expenditures in the target areas, but substantially reduced the likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure. The introduction of the insurance scheme did not have any effect on health outcomes for children and young adults, but appears to have increased mortality among individuals aged 65 and older. The negative health effects of the program appear to be primarily driven by the adverse provider incentives generated by the scheme and the resulting decline in the quality of care received by patients.

We apply this methodology to the construction of confidence regions with partially identified models of general form. The region is obtained by inverting a test of internal consistency of the econometric structure. We develop a dilation bootstrap methodology to deal with sampling uncertainty without reference to the hypothesized economic structure. It requires bootstrapping the quantile process for univariate data and a novel generalization of the latter to higher dimensions. Once the dilation is chosen to control the confidence level, the unknown true distribution of the observed data can be replaced by the known empirical distribution and confidence regions can then be obtained as in Galichon and Henry (2011) and Beresteanu et al.

The approach applies a nonparametric model to estimate a Bayesian six-dimensional health state short form (derived from short-form 36 health survey) health state valuation algorithm. Methods: A sample of 197 states defined by the six-dimensional health state short form (derived from short-form 36 health survey)has been valued by a representative sample of the Hong Kong general population by using standard gamble. The article reports the application of the nonparametric model and compares it to the original model estimated by using a conventional parametric random effects model. The two models are compared theoretically and in terms of empirical performance. Results: Advantages of the nonparametric model are that it can be used to predict scores in populations with different distributions of characteristics than observed in the survey sample and that it allows for the impact of respondent characteristics to vary by health state (while ensuring that full health passes through unity). The results suggest an important age effect with sex, having some effect, but the remaining covariates having no discernible effect. Conclusions: The nonparametric Bayesian model is argued to be more theoretically appropriate than previously used parametric models. Furthermore, it is more flexible to take into account the impact of covariates.","[Kharroubi, Samer A.] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO24 3NB, N Yorkshire, England; [Brazier, John E.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [McGhee, Sarah] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Community Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of York - UK; University of Sheffield; University of Hong Kong,"Kharroubi, SA (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Math, York YO24 3NB, N Yorkshire, England.",samer.kharroubi@york.ac.uk,"Kharroubi, Samer/AAQ-4583-2020; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",,,,,27,9,10,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,1032,1045,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.020,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041353.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700014,0

The simulation design used is based on real data usually employed for the evaluation of labour market programmes in Germany. We vary several dimensions of the design that are of practical importance, like sample size, the type of the outcome variable, and aspects of the selection process. We find that trimming individual observations with too much weight as well as the choice of tuning parameters are important for all estimators. A conclusion from our simulations is that a particular radius matching estimator combined with regression performs best overall, in particular when robustness to misspecifications of the propensity score and different types of outcome variables is considered an important property.

Mean-square and uniform convergence rates are established and shown to be optimal under simple and intuitive conditions. The uniform rate explicitly accounts for the effect of moment assumptions, which is useful in semiparametric inference. A general asymptotic integrated mean-square error approximation is obtained and used to derive an optimal plug-in tuning parameter selector. A uniform Bahadur representation is developed for linear functionals of the estimator. Using this representation, asymptotic normality is established, along with consistency of a standard-error estimator. The finite-sample performance of the partitioning estimator is examined and compared to other nonparametric techniques in an extensive simulation study. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the existing literature (Li and Vuong, 1998; Krasnokutskaya, 2011) by allowing the unobserved heterogeneity to be non-separable from bidders' valuations. Our central identifying assumption is that the distribution of bidder values is increasing in the state. When the state-space is finite, such monotonicity implies the full-rank condition needed for identification. Further, we extend our approach to the conditionally independent private values model of Li et al. (2000), as well as to unobserved heterogeneity settings in which the implicit reserve price or the cost of bidding varies across auctions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Some of the estimates in this literature may be affected by small samples, omitted variables, endogenous mobility in response to disasters, and errors in the measurement of gestation, as well as by a mechanical correlation between longer gestation and the probability of having been exposed. We use millions of individual birth records to examine the effects of exposure to hurricanes during pregnancy, and the sensitivity of the estimates to these econometric problems. We find that exposure to a hurricane during pregnancy increases the probability of abnormal conditions of the newborn such as being on a ventilator more than 30 min and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Although we are able to reproduce previous estimates of effects on birth weight and gestation, our results suggest that measured effects of stressful events on these outcomes are sensitive to specification and it is preferable to use more sensitive indicators of newborn health.

Methods: Pragmatic prospective cohort study design. Consecutive patients requiring elective colorectal surgery were allocated to either laparoscopic or open surgery by administrative staff in a district general hospital in England, 2006-2007. Patients completed two validated, generic measures of HRQOL at baseline (preoperatively) and on multiple occasions in the first 6 weeks postsurgery using diaries (EuroQol five-dimensional [EQ-5D] questionnaire: 16 times; short-form 36 health survey [SF-36]: 4 times; HRQOL was compared between groups at each time point, and overall using repeated-measures analysis. Results: Of 201 consecutive patients recruited, 32 (15.1%) were unable to complete diaries. Of the remaining 169 patients, 120 (71%) returned completed diaries at 28 days and 105 (62.1%) at 42 days. There was no difference in preoperative HRQOL scores between surgical groups, but the postoperative EQ-5D questionnaire and SF-36 scores were significantly higher in the laparoscopic group (EQ-5D questionnaire P = 0.005, SF-36 P = 0.007). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with a stoma have worse HRQOL than those without. HRQOL did not differ between the laparoscopic and open stoma patients. Conclusions: This study presents unique prospective data demonstrating that laparoscopic surgery confers HRQOL benefits for patients in the early recovery period following colorectal surgery, compared with open surgery. Consideration of these data in the context of a cost-effectiveness analysis will be reported separately.","[Dowson, Henry M.; Rockall, Timothy A.] Univ Surrey, Postgrad Med Sch, Minimal Access Therapy Training Unit, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Dowson, Henry M.] Frimley Pk Hosp, Frimley, England; [Ballard, Karen; Gage, Heather] Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Gage, Heather; Jackson, Daniel] Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Williams, Peter] Univ Surrey, Dept Math, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Rockall, Timothy A.] Royal Surrey Cty Hosp, Guildford, Surrey, England",University of Surrey; University of Surrey; University of Surrey; University of Surrey; Royal Surrey County Hospital,"Gage, H (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",h.gage@surrey.ac.uk,,"Gage, Heather/0000-0002-2049-9406",Ethicon Endo-surgery; Karl Storz; Ethicon Endo-surgery for research into laparoscopic colorectal surgery,Ethicon Endo-surgery; Karl Storz; Ethicon Endo-surgery for research into laparoscopic colorectal surgery,The first author has been awarded a grant from Ethicon Endo-surgery for research into laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

J,"Khalifa, S",,,,"Khalifa, Sherif",,,Undiscounted optimal growth with consumable capital and capital-intensive consumption goods,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EXISTENCE; MODEL,"This paper presents a complete characterization of the optimal policy in a two sector undiscounted growth model. The model is an extension of the Leontief two sector model, which analyzes the optimal allocation of capital and labor to a consumption good sector and an investment good sector. The paper extends this framework to include consumable capital. Thus, the planner has preferences over the consumption good and the consumable capital. Future welfare levels are treated equally as current ones. Geometric techniques are applied to characterize the optimal policy if the consumption good is capital-intensive. The results suggest that if the initial capital stock is below a threshold level, that depends upon the consumption of capital, there is no convergence to the golden rule stock. Otherwise. an economy with a low level of capital produces only investment goods and an economy with a high level of capital produces only consumption goods.

No study, however, has examined to what extent increased costs after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke are due to hospitalizations for the initial event, recurrent events, and/or nonvascular hospitalizations, and how costs compare with the year prior to the event. Methods: We studied patients in a population-based cohort study (Oxford Vascular Study) in the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2007. Hospitalization and cost details were obtained from patients' individualized Hospital Episode Statistics records. Results: A total of 295 incident TIA and 439 incident stroke patients were included. For patients with stroke, average costs increased from (sic)1437 in the year pre-event to (sic)6629 in the year post-event (P < 0.0001). Sixty-four percent ((sic)4224) of poststroke costs were due to hospitalizations linked to the index stroke, more than 30% of which were given nonvascular primary diagnoses on Hospital Episode Statistics, and (sic)653 (10%) were due to hospitalizations linked to subsequent vascular events. For patients with TIA, costs increased from (sic)876 1 year before the event to (sic)2410 in the year post-event (P < 0.0001). Patients with TIA incurred nonsignificantly higher costs due to hospitalizations linked to subsequent vascular events ((sic)774) than for hospitalizations linked to the index TIA ((sic)720). Conclusions: Hospital costs increased after TIA or stroke, primarily because of increased initial cerebrovascular hospitalizations. The finding that costs due to nonvascular diagnoses also increased after TIA or stroke appears, in part, to be explained by the miscoding of TIA/stroke-related hospitalizations in electronic information systems.","[Luengo-Fernandez, Ramon; Gray, Alastair M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Silver, Louise E.; Gutnikov, Sergei A.; Rothwell, Peter M.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Stroke Prevent Res Unit, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Rothwell, PM (通讯作者)，John Radcliffe Hosp, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Stroke Prevent Res Unit, Level 6,West Wing, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.",peter.rothwell@clneuro.ox.ac.uk,"Luengo-Fernandez, Ramon/L-6526-2013; Rothwell, Peter/ABE-5913-2020","Rothwell, Peter/0000-0001-9739-9211","Economic and Social Research Council/Medical Research Council/National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); UK Medical Research Council; Dunhill Medical Trust; Stroke Association; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford; NIHR; MRC [G0802248] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0802248] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10206] Funding Source: researchfish","Economic and Social Research Council/Medical Research Council/National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Dunhill Medical Trust(Dunhill Medical Trust); Stroke Association; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","R.L.-F. was funded from an Economic and Social Research Council/Medical Research Council/National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) early career fellowship in economics of health.

The model nests numerous ones currently in use, and is shown to outperform all its special cases. In particular, an extensive out-of-sample risk forecasting exercise for seven major FX and equity indices confirms the superiority of the general model compared to its special cases and other competitors. Estimation issues related to problems associated with mixture models are discussed, and a new, general, method is proposed to successfully circumvent these. The model is straightforwardly extended to the multivariate setting by using an independent component analysis framework. The tractability of the relevant characteristic function then facilitates portfolio optimization using expected shortfall as the downside risk measure. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First, we theoretically show that the VaR portfolio measure is subadditive in the relevant tail region if asset returns are multivariate regularly varying, thus allowing for dependent returns. Second, we note that VaR estimated from historical simulations may lead to violations of subadditivity. This upset of the theoretical VaR subadditivity in the tail arises because the coarseness of the empirical distribution can affect the apparent fatness of the tails. Finally, we document a dramatic reduction in the frequency of subadditivity violations, by using semi-parametric extreme value techniques for VaR estimation instead of historical simulations.

This influences companies' internal commercial decisions, including the price they set for their products. Other things being equal, there is a price threshold, which is the maximum price at which the device will be funded and which, if its value were known, would play a central role in price determination. This paper examines the problem of pricing a medical device from the vendor's point of view in the presence of uncertainty about what the price threshold will be. A formal solution is obtained by maximising the expected value of the net revenue function, assuming a Bayesian prior distribution for the price threshold. A least admissible price is identified. The model can also be used as a tool for analysing proposed pricing policies when no formal prior specification of uncertainty is available.

This paper examines the determinants of annual earnings of general practitioners (GPs) and specialists using the first wave of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life, a new longitudinal survey of doctors. For both GPs and specialists, earnings are higher for men, for those who are self-employed and for those who do after-hours or on-call work. GPs have higher earnings if they work in larger practices, in outer regional or rural areas, and in areas with lower GP density, whereas specialists earn more if they have more working experience, spend more time in clinical work and have less complex patients. Decomposition analysis shows that the mean earnings of GPs are lower than that of specialists because GPs work fewer hours, are more likely to be female, are less likely to undertake after-hours or on-call work, and have lower returns to experience. Roughly 50% of the income gap between GPs and specialists is explained by differences in unobserved characteristics and returns to those characteristics.

J,"Strulik, H",,,,"Strulik, Holger",,,The voracity effect revisited,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SUBSTITUTION; CONSUMPTION; ELASTICITY; GROWTH,"In an influential article Tornell and Lane (1999) considered an economy, populated by multiple powerful groups, in which property rights in the formal sector are not protected. They argued that then investment in an informal sector may be optimal and set up conditions for voracity such that a permanent positive shock in the formal sector leads to lower economic growth. Here I show that whenever investing in the informal sector is feasible, not investing in the informal sector is a Pareto-superior Nash equilibrium under the mild condition of an elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption smaller than unity. As a corollary, voracity disappears. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, clarity on the form of the expected causal relationship, the parameter identification strategy, and the mode of hypothesis testing is required to overcome a number of conceptual and methodological problems. We use the New Jersey statewide smoking ban as an example. We examine statewide admission rates for acute myocardial infarctions, strokes and lower limb fractures, and emergency room encounter rates for asthma exacerbations before and after the smoking ban. We discuss the identification options and show the sensitivity of estimates of the response function to different specifications of the stochastic and intervention components and to different modes of inference. Model misspecification is demonstrated by rolling Chow tests for structural breaks in repeated observations.

The cost-effectiveness of truncated therapy is not known. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of response-guided therapy versus standard-duration therapy on the basis of best available evidence. Methods: We developed a decision model for chronic hepatitis C virus infection representing two treatment strategies: 1) standard-duration therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1 or 4 and for 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 or 3 and 2) truncated therapy (i.e., 50% decrease in treatment duration) in patients with rapid virologic response. Patients for whom truncated therapy failed began standard-duration therapy guided by genotype. We used a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years. Results: In the base-case analysis, mean lifetime costs were $46,623 +/- $2,483 with standard-duration therapy and $42,354 +/- $2,489 with truncated therapy. Mean lifetime quality-adjusted life-years were similar between the groups (17.1 +/- 0.7 with standard therapy; 17.2 +/- 0.7 with truncated therapy). Across model simulations, the probability of truncated therapy being economically dominant (i.e., both cost saving and more effective) was 78.6%. The results were consistent when we stratified the data by genotype. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the results were sensitive only to changes in treatment efficacy. Conclusion: Truncated therapy based on rapid virologic response is likely to be cost saving for treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Cost-effectiveness varied with small changes in relative treatment efficacy.","[Gellad, Ziad F.; Muir, Andrew J.; Schulman, Kevin A.; Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC 27715 USA; [Gellad, Ziad F.; Muir, Andrew J.; Schulman, Kevin A.; Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Gellad, Ziad F.] Durham Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [McHutchison, John G.] Gilead Pharmaceut, Foster City, CA USA; [Sievert, William] Monash Univ, Monash Med Ctr, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Sharara, Ala I.] Amer Univ Beirut, Med Ctr, Beirut, Lebanon; [Brown, Kimberly A.] Henry Ford Hosp, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Flisiak, Robert] Med Univ Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland; [Jacobson, Ira M.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY USA; [Kershenobich, David] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Hosp Gen Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Manns, Michael P.] Hannover Med Sch, D-3000 Hannover, Germany",Duke University; Duke University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Durham VA Medical Center; Monash University; American University of Beirut; Henry Ford Health System; Henry Ford Hospital; Medical University of Bialystok; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Hospital General de Mexico; Hannover Medical School,"Gellad, ZF (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Clin Res Inst, POB 17969, Durham, NC 27715 USA.",ziad.gellad@duke.edu,"Flisiak, Robert/S-5356-2018","Flisiak, Robert/0000-0003-3394-1635","Merck Co., Inc.","Merck Co., Inc.(Merck & Company)","Source of financial support: This work was supported by an unrestricted grant from Merck & Co., Inc.",,62,5,6,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,876,886,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.010,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999138.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800014,0

Methods: A total of 485 respondents including cancer patients and health care professionals (medical oncologists, nurses, and pharmacists) were surveyed by using a discrete choice experiment in South Korea. Through a literature review and expert consultation, six attributes-progression-free survival, four adverse events (bone marrow suppression, hand-foot skin reaction, gastrointestinal perforation, and bleeding), and administration-were selected. This study employed the conditional logit regression model. Results: The six attributes are statistically significant for the patient group and health care professional group. The two groups, however, present differences in progression-free survival, hand-foot skin reaction, gastrointestinal perforation, and administration. The relative importance of adverse events is greater for the patient group, while that of efficacy and ad-ministration is greater for the health professional group. For doctors, the relative importance of efficacy is as high as 31%, compared with 7% for the patient group. If progression-free survival is prolonged by 1 month, the acceptable level of bone marrow suppression is 1.3% for the patient group and 9.6% for doctors and that of hand-foot skin reaction is 1.0% and 11.8%, respectively, for the patient group and doctors. Conclusions: This study demonstrates substantial differences in the preference for a targeted drug between the patient group and the health care professional group. Doctors prefer effective and orally administered drugs while patients show more reluctant attitudes about adverse events than do health care professionals.","[Park, Mi-Hai; Lee, Eui-Kyung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Pharm, Suwon 440746, Gyeongi Do, South Korea; [Jo, Changik] Hallym Univ, Dept Econ, Chunchon, South Korea; [Bae, Eun Young] Sangji Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Wonju, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Hallym University; Sangji University,"Lee, EK (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Pharm, 300 Cheonchoen Dong, Suwon 440746, Gyeongi Do, South Korea.",ekyung@skku.edu,,,Pfizer Korea,Pfizer Korea(Pfizer),Source of financial support: Pfizer Korea funded this study.,,46,19,19,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,933,939,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.05.008,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999144.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800020,0

The analysis is conducted within an intertemporal framework, where instantaneous utility is gained and lost and good and bad moods are experienced along a health-dependent random lifespan. The qualitative properties of the resulting optimal control model are investigated by making use of the Frischian form of the feedback demand functions. One of several surprising results derived from this framework is that the marginal value of health can be negative or positive, whereas the marginal values of wealth and mood are unambiguously positive.

Despite this, the UK government has pursued an active policy of hospital mergers, arguing that such consolidations will bring improvements for patients. We examine whether this promise is met. We exploit the fact that between 1997 and 2006 in England around half the short term general hospitals were involved in a merger, but that politics means that selection for a merger may be random with respect to future performance. We examine the impact of mergers on a large set of outcomes including financial performance, productivity, waiting times and clinical quality and find little evidence that mergers achieved gains other than a reduction in activity. Given that mergers reduce the scope for competition between hospitals the findings suggest that further merger activity may not be the appropriate way of dealing with poorly performing hospitals.

Specifically, we show how to impose monotonicity of the equilibrium bidding strategy; a key property of structural auction models not guaranteed in standard nonparametric estimation. We further develop methods for automatic: bandwidth selection.

We look at how the composition of the pool of active workers changes as the wage rate increases. Contrary to what would expect, average productivity does not necessarily increase monotonically in the wage rate. We identify conditions in which a wage increase reduces the average productivity and/or average vocation of active workers.

Based on the profile likelihood approach, it does not rely on any initial parametric estimator of the conditional mean function, and it is under stated conditions consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient, i.e., it achieves the semiparametric lower bound.

For a treatment D affecting both Q and Y*, three effects are of interest: 'participation' (i.e., the selection) effect of D on Q, 'visible performance' (i.e., the observed outcome) effect of D on Y equivalent to QY*, and 'invisible performance' (i.e., the latent outcome) effect of D on Y*. This paper shows the conditions under which the three effects are identified, respectively, by the three corresponding mean differences of Q, Y, and Y vertical bar Q = 1 (i.e., Y*vertical bar Q = 1) across the control (D = 0) and treatment (D = 1) groups. Our nonparametric estimators for those effects adopt a two-sample framework and have several advantages over the usual matching methods. First, there is no need to select the number of matched observations. Second, the asymptotic distribution is easily obtained. Third, over-sampling the control/treatment group is allowed. Fourth, there is a built-in mechanism that takes into account the 'non-overlapping support problem', which the usual matching deals with by choosing a 'caliper'. Fifth, a sensitivity analysis to gauge the presence of unobserved confounders is available. A simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed methods with matching methods, and a real data illustration is provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In comparison with the quasi-maximum-likelihood-based semiparametric estimator of Su and Jin (2010), we allow for both heteroscedasticity and spatial dependence in the error terms. We derive the limiting distributions of our estimators for both the parametric and nonparametric components in the model and demonstrate the estimator of the parametric component has the usual root n-asymptotics. When the error term also follows an SAR process, we propose an estimator for the parameter in the SAR error process and derive the joint asymptotic distribution for both spatial parameters. Consistent estimates for the asymptotic variance-covariance matrices of both the parametric and nonparametric components are provided. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that our estimators perform well in finite samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We first conducted a market-level analysis to investigate the availability of global biologics in Taiwan as well as the growth and concentration of aggregate spending on biologics. We then conducted a patient-level analysis to investigate the costs and utilization patterns for selected new biologics. Results: We found that the concentration index is such that the 20 leading biologics in Taiwan account for more than 90% of the total spending on biologics. In our patient-level study on four biologics, the annual cost of treatment per patient ranged from NT$100,000 to NT$400,000. The prevalence rate of the user was between 6.5 and 37.2 per 100,000 of population. The treatment costs were inversely related to the prevalence rate of users. We also found that physicians in larger and public hospitals were more likely to prescribe new biologics to their patients compared with their counterparts practicing in smaller and private hospitals. In addition, we found that physicians were more likely to prescribe biologics to patients with more severe diseases and higher comorbidities. Conclusions: We conclude that public spending on biologics in Taiwan is highly targeted toward about 20 products with higher annual expenditures and growth rates and that the utilization of these biologics is targeted at a small number of patients. In addition, the access to these costly biologics is not uniform among patients in a country with universal coverage for prescription drugs.","[Hsieh, Chee-Ruey] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Liu, Ya-Ming] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Social Sci, Dept Econ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Cheng Kung University,"Hsieh, CR (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, 128,Sect 2,Acad Rd, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",crh@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council in Taiwan; Worldwide Health Economics Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Services, New Jersey","National Science Council in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Worldwide Health Economics Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Services, New Jersey","This research was supported by the National Science Council in Taiwan and Worldwide Health Economics Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Services, New Jersey.

This study intended to review the lessons learned and compromises reached in implementing an evidence-based national formulary. Currently listed drugs are very different from new drugs. In terms of effectiveness, the level of existing evidence tends to be lower for currently listed drugs. Also, the evaluation plan was quite delayed because of the vast amount of literature. In the political decision-making process, a coalition was formed by the pharmaceutical companies with physicians, and the government had difficulty responding because of the strong resistance against the reevaluation of currently listed drugs. Although idealistic, it was an attempt to apply the same standard of cost-effectiveness for currently listed drugs as that for new drugs. To successfully implement the system, however, some factors that need to be considered were limitation of available evidence on currently listed drugs and specific strategies employed against political resistance.","[Lee, Eui-Kyung] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Clin Pharm, Seoul 140742, South Korea; [Kim, Bo-Yeon] Hlth Insurance Review & Assessment Serv, Seoul, South Korea; [Lim, Jae-Young] Korea Univ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Mi-Hai] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Pharm, Suwon, South Korea",Sookmyung Women's University; Korea University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lee, EK (通讯作者)，Sookmyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Clin Pharm, Hyochangwongil 52, Seoul 140742, South Korea.",ekyung@sm.ac.kr,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S100,S103,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.017,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265054.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000018,0

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. About 10 to 12 patients undergoing PD were randomly selected from each of the 10 hospitals located in every part of Thailand. Face-to-face interviews were conducted from October 2008 to February 2009. Patients assessed their health status by using five domains and a visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D score was calculated on the basis of responses to five domains by using the Thai value set. Multiple regression analyses using a stepwise method were employed to model the associations between the EQ-5D score, the VAS score, and patient characteristics. Results: The patients' mean age was 42.2 +/- 13.8 years; 53% were male. The mean PD duration was 7.4 +/- 6.0 months. The mean EQ-5D and visual analogue scale scores were 0.65 +/- 0.23 and 0.65 +/- 0.26, respectively. The EQ-5D score was higher than that obtained from a meta-analysis study (0.58). The multivariate regression model showed that education, work status, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease symptoms were significant predictors of the EQ-5D score. The significant predictors of the VAS score included work status, albumin level, use of erythropoietin, and end-stage renal disease symptoms. Conclusions: This Thai PD sample yielded higher EQ-5D scores than did other PD populations. To improve the health utility of Thai patients undergoing PD, the significant factors should be addressed. Because our PD sample had a short PD duration, their long-term health utility should be evaluated in future research.","[Sakthong, Phantipa] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Kasemsup, Vijj] Mahidol Univ, Ramathibodi Hosp, Dept Community Med, Bangkok 10700, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Mahidol University,"Sakthong, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Phyathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",psakthong@gmail.com,,,National Health Security Office of Thailand,National Health Security Office of Thailand,"This study was financially supported by the National Health Security Office of Thailand.

More specifically, the findings indicate that (i) agents in poor self-assessed health prior to the intervention have, all else equal, a higher propensity to take up insurance; and (ii) insurance coverage reduces the demand for self-protection in the form of preventive care.

(i) Treatment outcomes may be influenced by a covariate whose effect on outcome distributions is bounded (in one of numerous probability metrics). This is interesting because introduction of a covariate with unrestricted effects leads to a pathological result. (ii) The experiment may have limited validity because of selective noncompliance or because the sampling universe is a potentially selective subset of the treatment population. Thus, even large samples may generate misleading signals. These problems are formalized via a bounds approach that turns the problem into one of partial identification. In both scenarios, small but positive perturbations leave the minimax regret decision rule unchanged. Thus, minimax regret analysis is not knife-edge-dependent on ignoring certain aspects of realistic decision problems. Indeed, it recommends to entirely disregard covariates whose effect is believed to be positive but small, as well as small enough amounts of missing data or selective attrition. All findings are finite sample results derived by game theoretic analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: This study aimed to resolve the uncertainties and limitations of previous analyses and establish the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab under the list price and Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discounted price for the UK National Health Service. Methods: A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of omalizumab under the perspective of the National Health Service. Outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Patient subgroups were defined post hoc on the basis of data collected in clinical trials: previous hospitalization, on maintenance oral corticosteroids, and three or more previous exacerbations. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio varied from 30,109 to 57,557 per QALY gained depending on the population considered using the PAS price; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were over a third higher using the list price. Omalizumab is likely to be cost-effective at the threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY gained in the severe subgroups if the improvement in health-related quality of life from omalizumab is mapped from an asthma-specific measure to the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (vs. the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire directly collected from patients) or asthma mortality refers to death after hospitalization from asthma (vs asthma-mortality risk in the community). Conclusions: Although the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab is more favorable under the PAS price, it represents good value for money only in severe subgroups and under optimistic assumptions regarding asthma mortality and improvement in health related quality of life. For these reasons, omalizumab should be carefully targeted to ensure value for money.","[Faria, Rita; McKenna, Claire; Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Faria, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",rita.nevesdefaria@york.ac.uk,"Faria, Rita/H-3198-2019","Faria, Rita/0000-0003-3410-1435; fattahi, elahe/0000-0002-8626-9566",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) Programme,National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) Programme on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Under-funding and the growing costs of benefits may hinder the fiscal solvency of state and local governments. Findings from the private sector may not be applicable because many public sector workers are covered by union contracts or salary schedules and often benefit modifications require changes in legislation. Research has been limited by the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently large and representative data on public sector employees.

As beneficiaries enter each phase, their out-of-pocket medication costs change discontinuously. The benefit cycle restarts on 1 January of the next year. Taking advantage of variation in drug coverage, we study how individuals reinitiate discontinued medications in response to the non-linear price schedule. Because some beneficiaries who receive low-income subsidies (LIS) have zero or fixed small copayments throughout the year, we perform a difference-in-difference analysis by using the LIS group as a comparison. We find that individuals delay reinitiating important medications in December and are significantly more likely to reinitiate in January than in other months. Although we find some evidence that reinitiation is lower in the final months of the year, it is mostly driven by those who face higher prices due to the coverage gap. Our study suggests that individuals respond more to the current price of medications and do not anticipate future prices as well as theory would suggest.

Answering this question involves multiple technical difficulties: two-way causality between health and work, unobservable confounding factors and measurement error in survey measures of mental health. We attempt to overcome these difficulties by combining 10 waves of high-quality panel data with an instrumental variable model that allows for individual-level fixed effects. We focus on the extensive margin of employment, and we find evidence that a one-standard-deviation decline in mental health reduces employment by 30 percentage points. Further investigations suggest that this effect is predominantly a supply rather than a demand-side response and is larger for older than young workers.

The main challenge is in estimating the counterfactual; that is, what the patient's quality of life would be if they did not receive that level of service. A production function method is presented, which seeks to distinguish the variation in care-related quality of life in the data that is due to service use as opposed to other factors. A problem is that relevant need factors also affect the amount of service used and therefore any missing factors could create endogeneity bias. Instrumental variable estimation can mitigate this problem. This method was applied to a survey of older people using home care as a proof of concept. In the analysis, we were able to estimate a quality-of-life production function using survey data with the expected form and robust estimation diagnostics. The practical advantages with this method are clear, but there are limitations. It is computationally complex, and there is a risk of misspecification and biased results, particularly with IV estimation. One strategy would be to use this method to produce preliminary estimates, with a full trial conducted thereafter, if indicated.

Objective: The objective of this article was to provide solutions to incorporate the uncertainty from clinical data into the MCDA model when evaluating the overall benefit-risk profiles among different treatment options. Methods: Two statistical approaches, the delta-method approach and the Monte Carlo approach, were proposed to construct the confidence interval of the overall benefit-risk score from the MCDA model as well as other probabilistic measures for comparing the benefit-risk profiles between treatment options. Both approaches can incorporate the correlation structure between clinical parameters (criteria) in the MCDA model and are straightforward to implement. Results: The two proposed approaches were applied to a case study to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of an add-on therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (drug X) relative to placebo. It demonstrated a straightforward way to quantify the impact of the uncertainty from clinical data to the benefit-risk assessment and enabled statistical inference on evaluating the overall benefit-risk profiles among different treatment options. Conclusions: The delta-method approach provides a closed form to quantify the variability of the overall benefit-risk score in the MCDA model, whereas the Monte Carlo approach is more computationally intensive but can yield its true sampling distribution for statistical inference. The obtained confidence intervals and other probabilistic measures from the two approaches enhance the benefit-risk decision making of medicinal products.","[Wen, Shihua; Zhang, Lanju; Yang, Bo] AbbVie Inc, Data & Stat Sci, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA",AbbVie,"Wen, SH (通讯作者)，AbbVie Inc, Data & Stat Sci, Bldg AP9A-LL,1 North Waukegan Rd, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",shihua.wen@abbvie.com,,,AbbVie,AbbVie(AbbVie),"The design, research, analysis, and financial support were provided by AbbVie.",,27,23,26,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17,5.0,,,,,619,628,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.04.008,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128056.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700017,0

New reimbursement strategies attempt to reduce the risk of making the wrong decision, that is, paying for a technology that is not good value for the health care system, while promoting the adoption of innovative technologies into clinical practice. The remaining risk, however, is not shared between the manufacturer and the health care payer at the individual purchase level; it continues to be passed from the manufacturer to the payer at the time of purchase. In this article, we propose a health technology payment strategy-technology leasing reimbursement scheme-that allows the sharing of risk between the manufacturer and the payer: the replacing of up-front payments with a stream of payments spread over the expected duration of benefit from the technology, subject to the technology delivering the claimed health benefit. Using trastuzumab (Herceptin) in early breast cancer as an exemplar technology, we show how a technology leasing reimbursement scheme not only reduces the total budgetary impact of the innovative technology but also truly shares risk between the manufacturer and the health care system, while reducing the value of further research and thus promoting the rapid adoption of innovative technologies into clinical practice.","[Edlin, Richard] Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Hall, Peter] Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, LIHS, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Wallner, Klemens; McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, Sch Community Med, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada",University of Auckland; University of Leeds; University of Alberta,"McCabe, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, 736 Univ Terrace,8303 112 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada.",mccabe1@ualberta.ca,"Hall, Peter S/O-3131-2019","Hall, Peter S/0000-0001-6015-7841; Wallner, Klemens/0000-0003-3547-3425; Edlin, Richard/0000-0001-5216-083X",Capital Health Endowment in Emergency Medicine Research; Stem Cell Network; Alberta Innovates [201201154] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [CL-2012-02-501] Funding Source: researchfish,Capital Health Endowment in Emergency Medicine Research; Stem Cell Network; Alberta Innovates; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Christopher McCabe's research is supported in part by the Capital Health Endowment in Emergency Medicine Research; Klemens Wallner's work on the project was funded by the Stem Cell Network Global Research Program Public Policy Core Grant Enhancing Translational Stem Cell Research: Innovative Models for Multi-Sectoral Collaboration, Drs.

Methods: We developed a Markov model to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for different sequences of treatments for 40 year old patients with schizophrenia. We considered first-line treatment with one of the four SGAs: olanzapine (OLZ), risperidone (RSP), quetiapine (QTP), and ziprasidone (ZSD). Patients could switch to another of these antipsychotics as second-line therapy, and only clozapine (CLZ) was allowed as third-line treatment. We derived parameter estimates from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study and published sources. Results: The ZSD-QTP strategy (first-line treatment with LSD, change to QTP if LSD is discontinued, and switch to CLZ if up is discontinued) was most costly while yielding the greatest QALYs, with an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of $542,500 per QALY gained compared with the ZSD-RSP strategy. However, the ZSD-RSP strategy had an ICER of $5,200/QALY gained versus the RSP-ZSD strategy and had the greatest probability of being cost-effective given a willingness-to-pay threshold between $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY. All other treatment strategies were more costly and less effective than another strategy or combination of other strategies. Results varied by different time horizons adopted. Conclusions: The ZSD-RSP strategy was most cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold between $5,200 and $542,500 per QALY. Our results should be interpreted with caution because they are based largely on the CATIE trial with potentially limited generalizability to all patient populations and doses of SGAs used in practice.","[Park, Taehwan] Univ Minnesota, Coll Pharm, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kuntz, Karen M.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Kuntz, KM (通讯作者)，Div Hlth Policy & Management, 420 Delaware St SE,MMC 729, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",kmkuntz@umn.edu,,,,,,,53,13,16,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,310,319,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.02.008,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24968989.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900002,0

This is in recognition of the fact that leaving the labour market because of persistently low levels of health status, or because of new health shocks, is only one of the possible responses open to employees. We use the first six waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey to estimate the joint effect of health status and health shocks on working hours. To account for zero working hours, we use a dynamic random effects Tobit model of working hours. We follow Heckman (1981) and approximate the unknown initial conditions with a static equation that utilises information from the first wave of the data. Predicted individual health status is used to ameliorate the possible effects of measurement error and endogeneity. We conclude that overall, lower health status results in fewer working hours and that when they occur, health shocks lead to further reductions in working hours. Estimation results show that the model performs well in separating the time-persistent effect of health status and the potentially more transient health shocks on working hours.

The fast resample method directly exploits the score function representations computed on each bootstrap sample, thereby reducing computational time considerably. This method is used to approximate the limit distribution of parametric and semiparametric estimators, possibly simulation based, that admit an asymptotic linear representation. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the desirable performance and vast improvement in the numerical speed of the fast bootstrap method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we review and summarize existing studies, and then use a unique school-based panel data set from the USA to attempt to further our understanding of the relationship. The long duration (5 observations, 9 years) allows us to add to the understanding of the pattern of the tie, through our ability to test for changes in health status and multiple measures of income, and the school-based nature of the data allow us to add community socioeconomic status to the model. Increasing understanding of the income-health gradient has clear policy implications in terms of effective targeting of interventions to decrease the gradient and hence decrease health disparities among children.

To address this question, we use micro data to estimate a structural life-cycle model of individuals' employment, retirement and consumption decisions. We calculate that, in the case of Germany, an increase of 3.76 years in the pension age thresholds or a cut of 26.8% in the per-year value of public pension benefits would offset the fiscal consequences of the increase in life expectancy anticipated to occur over the next 40 years. On average, individuals value the increase in the pension age thresholds at 3.44% of baseline consumption, and are willing to forgo 8.51% of baseline consumption to avoid the cut in per-year pension value. The increase in the pension age thresholds makes 87.7% of individuals better-off, and generates large responses in labor supply and retirement behavior. However, the favorable effects of this reform depend on the availability of jobs for older individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We conduct robustness checks using matching, difference-in-differences methods and an alternative control group of later cancer patients. The different methods give approximately the same results. Cancer increases the risks of leaving the labour force and receiving disability pension, and the effects are larger for the less educated. Effects on income are small and mostly insignificant.

This paper derives principles for integrating risk-adjusted payments and premium policy in individual health insurance markets based on fitting total plan payments to health plan costs per person as closely as possible. A least squares regression including both health status and variables used in premiums reveals the weights a Regulator should put on risk adjusters when markets determine premiums.

Two studies - the first non-incentivised and the second incentivised - are reported in this article. In both studies, respondents are asked to make decisions that affect themselves (a personal decision making frame) and those for whom they are responsible (a social decision making frame). The results show non-negligible and systematic rates of preference reversal in both frames, although these rates are slightly, but non-significantly, lower in the incentivised condition. Moreover, in both studies, the rate of predicted preference reversal was somewhat higher in the social than in the personal decision making frame, a finding that is explained by greater risk aversion when choosing treatment options for others than when choosing treatments for oneself.

A new benchmark is introduced that can be used to investigate whether or not a node is outperformed by another node regarding the connections to some fixed set W of nodes. Networks where these subdued positions do not exist are called W-stable. In this paper special attention is paid to minimal W-stable (random) networks, where W is the set of nodes having a degree crossing some fixed number. The notion of W-covering also makes possible to disclose an alternative definition and role of key players in social networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Janssen, R. H.

We developed and validated a patient reported outcome sum-scaling measure to assess the severity and functional impacts of ARTIs. Methods: Qualitative interviews and field testing among adults with an ARTI were conducted to ascertain a high degree of face and content validity of the questionnaire. Subsequently, a draft version of the Acute Respiratory Tract infection Questionnaire (ARTIQ) was statistically validated by using the partial credit Rasch model to test dimensionality, objectivity, and reliability of items. Test of known groups' validity was conducted by comparing participants with and without an ART1. Results: The final version of the ARTIQ consisted of 38 items covering five dimensions (Physical upper, Physical-lower, Psychological, Sleep, and Medicine) and five single items. All final dimensions were confirmed to fit the Rasch model, thus enabling sum-scaling of responses. The ARTIQ scores in participants with an ARTI were significantly higher than in those without ARTI (known groups' validity). Conclusion: A self-administered, multidimensional, sum-scaling questionnaire with high face and content validity and adequate psychometric properties for assessing severity and functional impacts from ARTIs in adults is available to clinical trials and audits in primary care.","[Aabenhus, Rune] Univ Copenhagen, Res Unit Gen Practice, DK-1014 Copenhagen, Cph, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen, Sect Gen Practice, Dept Publ Hlth, DK-1014 Copenhagen, Cph, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Aabenhus, R (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Res Unit Gen Practice, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Box 2099, DK-1014 Copenhagen, Cph, Denmark.",runeaa@sund.ku.dk,"; Siersma, Volkert/G-6867-2016","Brodersen, John Brandt/0000-0001-9369-3376; Siersma, Volkert/0000-0003-1941-2681",General Practitioners Trust for Development (FLU),General Practitioners Trust for Development (FLU),Source of funding: Rune Aabenhus received a grant from The General Practitioners Trust for Development (FLU).,,28,11,12,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,987,992,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.011,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041348.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700009,0

Birmingham hip resurfacing is the most common MoM HRA in Alberta, and is therefore compared with conventional THA. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the expected cost utility of MoM HRA versus THA, in younger patients with OA, using a decision analytic model with a 15-year time horizon. Methods: A probabilistic Markov decision analytic model was constructed to estimate the expected cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of MoM HRA versus THA from a health care payer perspective. The base case considered patients with OA aged 50 years; men comprised 65.9% of the cohort. Sensitivity analyses evaluated cohort age, utility values, failure probabilities, and treatment costs. Data were derived from the Hip Improvement Project and the Hip and Knee Replacement Pilot databases in Alberta, the 2010 National Joint Replacement Registry of the Australian Orthopaedic Association, and the literature. Results: In the base case, THA was dominated by MoM HRA (incremental mean costs of -$583 and incremental mean QALYs of 0.079). In subgroup analyses, THA remained dominated when cohort age was 40 years instead of 50 years or when only men were assessed. THA dominated when the cohort age was 60 years or when only women were assessed. Results were sensitive to utilities, surgery costs, and MoM HRA revision and conversion probabilities. At a willingness-to-pay of Can $50,000/QALY, there was a 58% probability that MoM HRA is cost-effective. Conclusions: The results show that, on average, MoM HRA was preferred to THA for younger and male patients, but THA is still a reasonable option if the patient or clinician prefers given the small absolute differences between the options and the confidence ellipses around the cost-effectiveness estimates.","[Heintzbergen, Sanne; Kulin, Nathalie A.; Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Heintzbergen, Sanne; IJzerman, Maarten J.; Steuten, Lotte M.

Cost-utility analysis uses the quality-adjusted life-year as the outcome measure of health. High-income countries have undertaken health state valuation (HSV) studies to determine country specific utility weights to facilitate valuation of health-related quality of life. Despite an evident need, however, the extent of HSVs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is unclear. Methods: The literature was searched systematically by using four databases and additional Web searches to identify HSV studies carried out in LMICs. The Preferred Reporting System for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) strategy was followed to ensure systematic selection of the articles. Results: The review identified 17 HSV studies from LMICs. Twelve studies were undertaken in upper middle-income countries, while lower middle- and low-income countries contributed three and two studies, respectively. There were 7 generic HSV and 10 disease-specific HSV studies. The seven generic HSVs included five EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, one six-dimensional health state short form (derived from short-form 36 health survey), and one Assessment of Quality of Life valuations. Time trade-off was the predominant valuation method used across all studies. Conclusions: This review found that health state valuations from LMICs are uncommon and utility weights are generally unavailable for these countries to carry out health economic evaluation. More HSV studies need to be undertaken in LMICs to facilitate efficient resource allocation in their respective health systems.","[Kularatna, Sanjeewa; Whitty, Jennifer A.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Sch Med, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Kularatna, Sanjeewa; Whitty, Jennifer A.; Johnson, Newell W.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Populat & Social Hlth Res Programme, Griffith Hlth Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Griffith University,"Kularatna, S (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Sch Med, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",s.kularatna@griffith.edu.au,"Johnson, Newell W/D-8152-2019; Whitty, Jennifer A/N-6434-2013; Scuffham, Paul/AAS-8084-2021","Johnson, Newell W/0000-0001-5866-262X; Whitty, Jennifer A/0000-0002-5886-1933; Scuffham, Paul/0000-0001-5931-642X; Kularatna, Sanjeewa/0000-0001-5650-154X",,,,,49,27,29,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,1091,1099,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.05.006,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041360.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700021,0

Recent studies conclude that happiness and depression may be highly contagious across social ties. The results may be biased, however, because of selection and common shocks. We provide unbiased estimates by using exogenous variation from college roommate assignments. Our findings are consistent with no significant overall contagion of mental health and no more than small contagion effects for specific mental health measures, with no evidence for happiness contagion and modest evidence for anxiety and depression contagion. The weakness of the contagion effects cannot be explained by avoidance of roommates with poor mental health or by generally low social contact among roommates. We also find that similarity of baseline mental health predicts the closeness of roommate relationships, which highlights the potential for selection biases in studies of peer effects that do not have a clearly exogenous source of variation. Overall, our results suggest that mental health contagion is lower, or at least more context specific, than implied by the recent studies in the medical literature.

Including such unobserved covariates may control for both the individual-specific unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of the explanatory variables. Without specifying the distribution of the initial condition with the unobserved variables, we show that the models are nonparametrically identified from two periods of the dependent variable Y-it and three periods of the covariate X-it. The main identifying assumptions include high-level injectivity restrictions and require that the evolution of the observed covariates depends on the unobserved covariates but not on the Jagged dependent variable. We also propose a sieve maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and focus on two classes of nonlinear dynamic panel data models, i.e., dynamic discrete choice models and dynamic censored models. We present the asymptotic properties of the sieve MLE and investigate the finite sample properties of these sieve-based estimators through a Monte Carlo study.

Over the past 3 decades, drugs and assisted reproductive technologies have been developed to treat infertility, but treatment is costly. Since 1985, several states have adopted insurance mandates that require providers to cover or offer infertility treatments. In this paper, I examine the impact of strong mandate-to-cover laws on multiple births, which are associated with infertility treatment use. I also investigate whether the laws had heterogeneous treatment effects. Using birth certificate data from 1980-2002, I show that the laws had a small and statistically insignificant impact on multiple birth rates. However, I find that there were over 5300 mandate-induced triplet and higher-order births over the period, for which the delivery costs alone are estimated to be over $900 million. Increases in multiple birth rates are only observed for women over 30 and are greater for women who are married, white, or have a college degree. This is consistent with previous work, which finds that the mandates did not reduce disparities in treatment use.

Our empirical application combines georeferenced data on the location of fast-food restaurants with data about personal health, behavioral, and neighborhood characteristics. We define a local food environment' for every individual utilizing buffers around a person's home address. Individual food landscapes are potentially endogenous because of spatial sorting of the population and food outlets, and the body mass index (BMI) values for individuals living close to each other are likely to be spatially correlated because of observed and unobserved individual and neighborhood effects. The potential biases associated with endogeneity and spatial correlation are handled using spatial econometric estimation techniques. Our application provides quantitative estimates of the effect of proximity to fast-food restaurants on obesity in an urban food market. We also present estimates of a policy simulation that focuses on reducing the density of fast-food restaurants in urban areas. In the simulations, we account for spatial heterogeneity in both the policy instruments and individual neighborhoods and find a small effect for the hypothesized relationships between individual BMI values and the density of fast-food restaurants.

Methods: A decision-analytic model estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for trabectedin plus PLD compared with PLD alone from the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective over a lifetime horizon. Mean progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated by using parametric survival distributions adjusted for imbalances discovered in the final survival data. Between-arm imbalances included the platinum-free interval, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score. Cost categories included drug, administration, medical management, and treatment of adverse events. Quality of life was measured by using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Uncertainty was addressed by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Over a lifetime horizon, trabectedin plus PLD increased mean progression-free survival by 3.0 months and overall survival by 9.7 months compared with PLD alone. The additional cost and QALYs of trabectedin plus PLD were 18,476 and 0.49, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 38,026 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that results were sensitive to platinum-free interval adjustment and the choice of survival distributions. Conclusions: The analysis estimated a significant improvement in mean overall survival and incremental cost per QALY compared with that calculated in the original National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence assessment, which was based on immature survival data.","[Fisher, Mark] WG Consulting, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Gore, Martin] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, London, England",Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust,"Fisher, M (通讯作者)，2 Cressex Rd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England.",markf@wg-group.com,,,PharmaMar,PharmaMar,"WG Consulting was commissioned by PharmaMar, Madrid, Spain, to undertake this analysis.

We develop an integrated econometric and theoretical framework to model firm demand assessment and subsequent pricing decisions with limited information. We introduce a panel data discrete choice model whose realistic assumptions about consumer behavior deliver partially identified preferences and thus generate ambiguity in the firm pricing problem. We use the minimax-regret criterion as a decision-making rule for firms facing this ambiguity. We illustrate the framework's benefits relative to the most common discrete choice analysis approach through simulations and empirical examples with field data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Klaus, B; Klijn, F",,,,"Klaus, Bettina; Klijn, Flip",,,Local and global consistency properties for student placement,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Student placement; Consistency; Converse consistency; Priority structure,COLLEGE ADMISSIONS; ALLOCATION; MECHANISMS; STABILITY,"In the context of resource allocation on the basis of priorities, Ergin (2002) identifies a necessary and sufficient condition on the priority structure such that the student-optimal stable mechanism satisfies a consistency principle. Ergin (2002) formulates consistency as a local property based on a fixed population of agents and fixed resources we refer to this condition as local consistency and to his condition on the priority structure as local acyclicity. A related but stronger necessary and sufficient condition on the priority structure such that the student-optimal stable mechanism satisfies a more standard global consistency property is unit acyclicity. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the student-optimal stable mechanism to satisfy converse consistency principles. First, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition (local shift-freeness) on the priority structure such that the student-optimal stable mechanism satisfies local converse consistency. Interestingly, local acyclicity implies local shift-freeness and hence the student-optimal stable mechanism more frequently satisfies local converse consistency than local consistency. Second, in order for the student-optimal stable mechanism to be globally conversely consistent, one again has to impose unit acyclicity on the priority structure. Hence, unit acyclicity is a necessary and sufficient condition on the priority structure for the student-optimal stable mechanism to satisfy global consistency or global converse consistency.

Cutler and Gruber (1996) found crowd-out in up to half of the newly eligible children, while Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004) found almost none. This paper exploits many regression discontinuity (RD) designs to estimate heterogeneous effects of public insurance eligibility. Crowd-out and its impact on spending and utilization is documented across the income spectrum, but effects are smaller at higher income levels. These differences vary by state and correspond to changes in the reimbursement rates of public insurance plans.

Appropriate diagnosis and management is challenging because the vast majority are benign. The MoleMate system is a handheld SIAscopy scanner integrated with a primary care diagnostic algorithm aimed at improving the management of pigmented skin lesions in primary care. Methods: This decision-model-based economic evaluation draws on the results of a randomized controlled trial of the MoleMate system versus best practice (ISRCTN79932379) to estimate the expected long-term cost and health gain of diagnosis with the MoleMate system versus best practice in an English primary care setting. The model combines trial results with data from the wider literature to inform long-term prognosis, health state utilities, and cost. Results: Results are reported as mean and incremental cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and value of information analysis. Over a lifetime horizon, the MoleMate system is expected to cost an extra 18 pound over best practice alone, and yield an extra 0.01 QALYs per patient examined. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is 1,896 pound per QALY gained, with a 66.1% probability of being below 30,000 pound per QALY gained. The expected value of perfect information is 43.1 pound million. Conclusions: Given typical thresholds in the United Kingdom (20,000- pound 30,000 pound per QALY), the MoleMate system may be cost-effective compared with best practice diagnosis alone in a primary care setting. However, there is considerable decision uncertainty, driven particularly by the sensitivity and specificity of MoleMate versus best practice, and the risk of disease progression in undiagnosed melanoma; future research should focus on reducing uncertainty in these parameters.","[Wilson, Edward C.

We propose modified CUSUM and LM tests that are built on a robust estimator of the long-run variance of squared series. We establish conditions under which the new tests have standard null distributions and diverge faster than standard tests under the alternative. The theory allows smooth and abrupt structural changes that can be small. The smoothing parameter is automatically selected such that the proposed test has good finite-sample size and meanwhile achieves decent power gain. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The financial reward was based on the performance of the entire network, but the network implemented rewards at the practice level. Practice-level rewards were awarded on an all-or-nothing basis if the GPR met or exceeded specialty-specific targets that increased each year. Although that design gave the practices a strong incentive to meet the target, practices performing far below the target might give up, costing the network its reward. Using a partial adjustment model, we estimate that in the absence of pay for performance, the average equilibrium value of GPR was 58.3%. We estimate that GPR would be maximized if the target were set at 77%. The GPR-maximizing target would induce an improvement in average GPR from 58.3% to 65.8% or 7.5 percentage points. When the target is set above 80%, practices with equilibrium GPR below 58.3% will give up in the sense that they will not improve relative to their equilibrium value.

The paper presents a least squares estimator for the model parameter in a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model driven by a multivariate regularly varying Levy process with infinite variance. We show that the estimator is consistent. Moreover, we derive its asymptotic behavior and test statistics. The results are compared to the finite variance case. For the proof we require some new results on multivariate regular variation of products of random vectors and central limit theorems. Furthermore, we embed this model in the setup of a co-integrated model in continuous time. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Secondary data from a longitudinal double-blind clinical drug study were used. Patients received enalapril or placebo and were followed for 2 years during the drug component, followed by a 3-year postdrug component. Primary variables of interest were creatinine levels during the drug component and number of hospitalizations in the postdrug component. Latent growth modeling (LGM) methods were used to examine the treatment response variability in the data. GMM methods were applied where substantial variability was found to identify latent (unobserved) subsets of differential responders, using treatment groups as known classes. Post hoc analyses were applied to characterize emergent subgroups. Results: LGM methods demonstrated a large variability in creatinine levels. GMM methods identified two subsets of patients for each treatment group. Placebo class 2 (7.0% of the total sample) and enalapril class 2 (8.5%) include individuals whose creatinine levels start at 1.114 mg/dl and 1.108 mg/dl, respectively, and show worsening (slopes: 0.023 and 0.017, respectively). Placebo class 1 (43.1%) and enalapril class 1 (41.4%) individuals start with lower creatinine levels (1.082 and 1.083 mg/dl, respectively) and show very minimal change (0.008 and 0.003, respectively). Post hoc analyses revealed significant differences between placebo/enalapril class 1 and placebo/enalapril class 2 in terms of New York Heart Association functional ability, depression, functional impairment, creatinine levels, mortality, and hospitalizations. Conclusions: GMM methods can identify subsets of differential responders in clinical trial data. This can result in a more accurate understanding of treatment effects.","[Stull, Donald E.; Houghton, Katherine] RTI Hlth Solut, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England",Research Triangle Institute,"Stull, DE (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 2nd Floor,Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England.",dstull@rti.org,,"Houghton, Katherine/0000-0003-4416-6080; Stull, Donald/0000-0001-9808-5417",,,,,39,8,9,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2013,16,1.0,,,,,164,176,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.08.2215,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,077WN,23337228.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314060200020,0

The study provides new insight into the effects of hospital privatization in three American states (California, Florida, and Massachusetts) in the period 1994 to 2003, focusing on three aspects: 1) profitability; 2) productivity and efficiency; and 3) benefits to the community (particularly, scope of services offered, price level, and impact on charity care). For each variable analyzed, we compared the 3-year mean values pre- and postconversion. Pre- and postconversion changes in hospitals performance were then compared with a nonequivalent comparison group of American public hospitals. The results of our study indicate that following privatization, hospitals increased operating margins, reduced their length of stay, and enjoyed higher occupancy, but at some possible cost to access to care for their communities in terms of higher price markups and loss of beneficial but unprofitable services.","[Villa, Stefano] Catholic Univ, Dept Management, Milan, Italy; [Villa, Stefano] Catholic Univ, Res Ctr Hlth Care Management CERISMAS, Milan, Italy; [Kane, Nancy] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

To facilitate a general asymptotic inference theory relevant to economic applications, this paper first extends the notion of near-epoch dependent (NED) processes used in the time series literature to random fields. The class of processes that is NED on, say, an alpha-mixing process, is shown to be closed under infinite transformations, and thus accommodates models with spatial dynamics. This would generally not be the case for the smaller class of alpha-mixing processes. The paper then derives a central limit theorem and law of large numbers for NED random fields. These limit theorems allow for fairly general forms of heterogeneity including asymptotically unbounded moments, and accommodate arrays of random fields on unevenly spaced lattices. The limit theorems are employed to establish consistency and asymptotic normality of GMM estimators. These results provide a basis for inference in a wide range of models with spatial dependence.

The transmission mechanism involves the ARVs having a direct effect on QoL via the side effects of the medications and two other effects (one indirect and one reverse) both working through feelings of depression. On a scale of 0 to 100, ARVs raise the QoL by 1 percentage point. This was because there was a large positive indirect effect of ARVs on QoL of 28 percentage points via the reduction in depression, which offsets both the 24 percentage-point reduction due to the direct effect and the 3 percentage-point decline from the reverse effect. Now, QoL effects can be applied to the additional life years generated by ARVs to form the quality adjusted life years outcome measure for use in economic evaluations of ARVs.

In the light of policies aimed at postponing retirement ages, an important question is whether continued labour supply helps to maintain high levels of cognition at older ages. We use data of older men from the US Health and Retirement Study to estimate the effect of continued labour market participation at older ages on later-life cognition. As retirement itself is likely to depend on cognitive functioning and may thus be endogenous, we use offers of early retirement windows as instruments for retirement in econometric models for later-life cognitive functioning. These offers of early retirement are legally required to be nondiscriminatory and thus, inter alia, unrelated to cognitive functioning. At the same time, these offers of early retirement options are significant predictors of retirement. Although the simple ordinary least squares estimates show a negative relationship between retirement duration and various measures of cognitive functioning, instrumental variable estimates suggest that these associations may not be causal effects. Specifically, we find no clear relationship between retirement duration and later-life cognition for white-collar workers and, if anything, a positive relationship for blue-collar workers.

Voting rules based on the mean include many that are familiar: the Borda Count, Kemeny rule, approval voting, etc. (see Zwicker (2008a,b)). These mean rules can be implemented by voting machines (interactive simulations of physical mechanisms) that use ideal rubber bands to achieve an equilibrium among the competing preferences of the voters. One consequence is that in any such rule, a voter who is further from consensus exerts a stronger tug on the election outcome, because her rubber band is more stretched. While the R-1 median has been studied in the context of voting, mediancentre-based rules are new. Voting machines for these rules require that the tug exerted by a voter be independent of his distance from consensus; replacing rubber bands with weights suspended from strings provides exactly this effect. We discuss some novel properties exhibited by these rules, as well as a broader question suggested by our investigations-What are the critical relationships among resistance to manipulation, decisiveness, and responsiveness for a voting rule? We argue that a distorted view may arise from an exclusive focus on the first, without due attention to the other two. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was adapted to the Irish setting to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes (fractures and quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) for three adherence scenarios: no treatment, real-world adherence, and full adherence over 3 years. The real-world scenario employed adherence and persistence data from the Irish Health Services Executive-Primary Care Reimbursement Services pharmacy claims database. We also investigated the cost-effectiveness of hypothetical behavioral interventions to improve medication adherence (according to their cost and effect on adherence). Results: The number of fractures prevented and the QALY gain obtained at real-world adherence levels represented only 57% and 56% of those expected with full adherence, respectively. The costs per QALY gained of real-world adherence and of full adherence compared with no treatment were estimated at (sic)11,834 and (sic)6,341, respectively. An intervention to improve adherence by 25% would result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)11,511 per QALY and (sic)54,182 per QALY, compared with real-world adherence, if the intervention cost an additional (sic)50 and (sic)100 per year, respectively. Discussion: Poor adherence with osteoporosis medications results in around a 50% reduction in the potential benefits observed in clinical trials and a doubling of the cost per QALY gained from these medications. Depending on their costs and outcomes, programs to improve adherence have the potential to be an efficient use of resources.","[Hiligsmann, Mickael; Reginster, Jean-Yves] Univ Liege, Dept Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Hiligsmann, Mickael] Maastricht Univ, CAPHRI Res Inst, Dept Internal Med, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Hiligsmann, Mickael] Maastricht Univ, CAPHRI Res Inst, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Hiligsmann, Mickael; McGowan, Bernie] Univ Liege, HEC Sch Management, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Bennett, Kathleen] St James Hosp, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Trinity Ctr Hlth Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Barry, Michael] St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin, Ireland",University of Liege; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; University of Liege; Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Hiligsmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, Dept Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Ave Hop 3,Bat B23, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",m.hiligsmann@ulg.ac.be,"Reginster, Jean-Yves/AGC-6097-2022","Bennett, Kathleen/0000-0002-2861-7665; Barry, Michael/0000-0002-6232-3003",Irish Health Research Board,Irish Health Research Board(Health Research Board - Ireland),This project was funded by the Irish Health Research Board.,,57,45,46,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,604,612,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.001,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867768.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100002,0

We establish that three popular canonical representations are unidentified, and demonstrate how unidentified regions can complicate numerical optimization. A separate contribution of the paper is the proposal of minimum-chi-square estimation as an alternative to MLE. We show that, although it is asymptotically equivalent to MLE, it can be much easier to compute. In some cases. MCSE allows researches to recognize with certainty whether a given estimate represents a global maximum of the likelihood function and makes feasible the computation of small-sample standard errors.

Data from clinical trials that include both surrogate and final endpoints can be used in a joint analysis that combines these two approaches. This joint approach allows the inclusion of information regarding the effects of treatment on surrogate endpoints while relaxing the strong assumption of conditional independence associated with indirect model-based analyses. An example cost-effectiveness analysis of Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme is used to compare the different approaches. It is shown that despite using a common data set, the different analytic approaches produce differing estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and the value of future research. The paper concludes by discussing the selection of the appropriate analytic approach.

For this reason private supplementary insurance, named Medigap, has been available to cover Medicare gaps. This paper studies how Medigap affects the utilization of inpatient care, separating the incentive and selection effects of supplementary insurance. For this purpose, we use two alternative estimation methods: a standard recursive bivariate probit and a discrete multivariate finite mixture model. We find that estimated incentive effects are modest and quite similar across models. There seems to be very significant selection, with the presence of both adversely and advantageously selected individuals, stemming from the multidimensional nature of residual heterogeneity.

Methods: The study population comprised 152 patients with diabetes in Ostergotland County, Sweden. Participants were interviewed by telephone by using the time trade-off (TTO) method and a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) (direct valuations) as well as the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the health utilities index mark 3 (HUI-3) (indirect valuations). The quality-adjusted life-year weights were adjusted for potential confounders by using analysis of covariance. The empirical validity of the measures was examined by testing their ability to detect hypothetical differences between severity levels of diabetic retinopathy and by investigating the correlation between the measures and the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). Results: All measures detected significant differences in scores between patient groups classified according to visual impairment in the better eye (analysis of covariance, P < 0.05), but only HUI-3 and EQ-VAS detected significant differences between patient groups classified according to visual impairment or pathological progression in the worse eye. HUI-3 recorded a difference of 0.43 in values between normal vision and blindness in the better eye, which was more than twice the differences captured by the other measures (0.15-0.20). In addition, HUI-3 showed the highest correlation with NEI VFQ-25 (r = 0.54; P < 0.001). Conclusions: In cost-utility analyses, the choice of quality-adjusted life-year measure may affect whether an intervention is considered cost-effective. Furthermore, if decisions are to be based on values from the general public, HUI-3 can be recommended for cost-utility analyses of interventions directed at diabetic retinopathy.","[Heintz, Emelie; Levin, Lars-Ake] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Med Technol Assessment, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Wirehn, Ann-Britt] Linkoping Univ, Local Hlth Care Res & Dev Unit, Ostergotland Cty Council, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Peebo, Beatrice Bourghardt] Linkoping Univ Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden; [Rosenqvist, Ulf] Motala Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Endocrinol, Motala, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University; City Council Ostergotland; Linkoping University,"Heintz, E (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Ctr Med Technol Assessment, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",emelie.heintz@liu.se,"Heintz, Emelie/GYD-4031-2022","Heintz, Emelie/0000-0002-0715-7591",AstraZeneca AB,AstraZeneca AB(AstraZeneca),"The study was sponsored by AstraZeneca AB.

This analysis evaluated the level of agreement between self-and proxy-reported HCRU data, as recorded through an Internet-based survey, and administrative claims-based HCRU data. Methods: The Child and Household Influenza-Illness and Employee Function study collected self-and proxy-reported HCRU data monthly between November 2007 and May 2008. Data included the occurrence and number of visits to hospitals, emergency departments, urgent care centers, and outpatient offices for a respondent's and his or her household members' care. Administrative claims data from the MarketScan (R) Databases were assessed during the same time and evaluated relative to survey-based metrics. Only data for individuals with employer-sponsored health care coverage linkable to claims were included. The Kappa (kappa) statistic was used to evaluate visit concordance, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to describe frequency consistency. Results: Agreement for presence of a health care visit and the number of visits were similar for self- and proxy-reported HCRU data. There was moderate to substantial agreement related to health care visit occurrence between survey-based and claims-based HCRU data for inpatient, emergency department, and office visits (kappa:0.47-0.77). There was less agreement on health care visit frequencies, with intraclass correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.14 to 0.71. Conclusions: This study's agreement values suggest that Internet-based surveys are an effective method to collect self- and proxy-reported HCRU data.

The residuals are obtained from the usual least squares estimation of the postulated cointegrating relationships from each individual unit, and the nonlinear IV panel unit root testing procedure is applied to the panels of the fitted residuals using as instruments the nonlinear transformations of the adaptively fitted lagged residuals. The t-ratio, based on the nonlinear IV estimator, is then constructed to test for unit root in the fitted residuals for each cross-section. We show that such nonlinear IV t-ratios are asymptotically normal and cross-sectionally independent under the null hypothesis of no cointegration. The average or the minimum of the IV t-ratios can, therefore, be used to test for the null of a fully non-cointegrated panel against the alternative of a mixed panel, i.e., a panel with only some cointegrated units. We also consider the maximum of the IV t-ratios to test for a mixed panel against a fully cointegrated panel. The critical values of the minimum, maximum as well as the average tests are easily obtained from the standard normal distribution function. Our simulation results indicate that the residual based tests for cointegration perform quite well in finite samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We formulate and test two alternative hypotheses. The first hypothesis is based on the premise that with time so scarce, physicians equalize the marginal value of time across patients. The second, alternative hypothesis states that physicians allocate the same time to each patient, regardless of how much the patient benefits from the time at the margin. For our empirical work, we examine the presence of a sharply increasing subjective shadow price of time around the target time using video recordings of 385 visits by elderly patients to their primary care physician. We structure the data at the topic level and find evidence consistent with the alternative hypothesis. Specifically, time elapsed within a visit is a very strong determinant of the current topic being the last topic. This finding implies the physician's shadow price of time is rising during the course of a visit. We consider whether dislodging a target-time mentality from physicians (and patients) might contribute to more productive primary care practice.

Under mild regularity conditions, for economies with either bounded or unbounded state spaces, continuous monotone Markov perfect Nash equilibrium (henceforth MPNE) are shown to exist, and form an antichain. Further, for each such MPNE, we can also construct a corresponding stationary Markovian equilibrium invariant distribution. We then show for many versions of our economies found in applied work in macroeconomics, unique MPNE exist relative to the space of bounded measurable functions. We also relate all of our results to those obtained by promised utility/continuation methods based upon the work of Abreu et al. (1990). As our results are constructive, we can provide characterizations of numerical methods for approximating MPNE, and we construct error bounds. Finally, we provide a series of examples to show the potential applications and limitations of our results. (C)2012 Elsevier B.V.

This breakdown point can be very low for moderate subsampling block sizes, which implies the fragility of subsampling procedures, even when they are applied to robust statistics. This instability arises also for data driven block size selection procedures minimizing the minimum confidence interval volatility index, but can be mitigated if a more robust calibration method can be applied instead. To overcome these robustness problems, we introduce a consistent robust subsampling procedure for M-estimators and derive explicit subsampling quantile breakdown point characterizations for MM-estimators in the linear regression model. Monte Carlo simulations in two settings where the bootstrap fails show the accuracy and robustness of the robust subsampling relative to the subsampling. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Thus changes in staffing ratios from the pre- to post-mandate periods are driven in part by the legislation. We find persuasive evidence that AB394 had the intended effect of decreasing patient/nurse ratios in hospitals that previously did not meet mandated standards.

Methods: A Markov decision model using published data for COPD exacerbation outcomes. The advance directives that were modeled were as follows: DNI, allowing only noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or Full Code, allowing all forms of mechanical ventilation including invasive mechanical ventilation with endotracheal tube (ETT) insertion. Results: In community-dwellers, Full Code resulted in a greater likelihood of survival and higher QALYs (4-year survival: 23% Full Code, 18% DNI; QALYs: 1.34 Full Code, 1.24 DNI). When considering patient preferences regarding complications, however, if patients were willing to give up >3 months of life expectancy to avoid ETT complications, or >1 month of life expectancy to avoid long-term institutionalization, DNI resulted in higher QALYs. For patients in long-term institutions, DNI resulted in a greater likelihood of survival and higher QALYs (4-year survival: 2% DNI, 1% Full Code; QALYs: 0.29 DNI, 0.24 Full Code). In sensitivity analyses, the model was sensitive to the probabilities of ETT complication and noninvasive mechanical ventilation failure and to patient preferences about ETT complications and long-term institutionalization. Conclusion: Our model demonstrates that patient preferences regarding ETT complications and long-term institutionalization, as well as baseline place of residence, affect the advance directive recommendation when considered in terms of both survival and QALYs. Decision modeling can demonstrate the potential trade-off between survival and quality of life, using patient preferences and disease-specific data, to inform the shared advance directive decision.","[Hajizadeh, Negin; Braithwaite, R.

Methods: We performed the cost-effectiveness of FOLFOX compared with standard FU/LV treatment by the retrospective analysis of patient-level data from the randomized controlled Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer (MOSAIC) trial. Predicted mean time spent in each disease state was calculated by our statistical model, which takes into account the cure rate and treats death from causes other than colon cancer as a competing risk. We performed this analysis from the perspective of the health-care payer. Using a time horizon of 30 years, both cost and effectiveness were discounted by 3% per year. Results: Estimated cure rates for colon cancer were 0.715 (FOLFOX) and 0.622 (FU/LV). Estimated medical costs of FOLFOX were JPY 3.1 million (USD 34,000) compared with JPY 1.9 million (USD 22,000) of FU/LV. The mean estimated quality-adjusted life- year was 9.83 with FOLFOX and 9.07 with that of FU/LV. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of FOLFOX was JPY 1.5 million (USD 17,000) per quality-adjusted life-year compared with FU/LV, which was supported by sensitivity analysis. Even if we assume that Japanese outcomes were better than those reported by the MOSAIC trial, which would reduce the difference between cure rates for each treatment to 5%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained below 5.0 million (USD 56,000) per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusions: Adjuvant FOLFOX is a cost-effective treatment for stage III colon cancer in Japan compared with FU/LV therapy. Even when parameters were changed to reflect smaller improvements with FOLFOX, the conclusion is the same.","[Shiroiwa, Takeru; Shimozuma, Kojiro] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Takeuchi, Toshihiro; Ohashi, Yasuo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Tokyo, Japan; [Fukuda, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Hlth Econ & Epidemiol Res, Sch Publ Hlth, Tokyo, Japan",Ritsumeikan University; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Shiroiwa, T (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, 1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan.",t.shiroiwa@gmail.com,"Takeru, Shiroiwa/O-7926-2019","Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932",Comprehensive Support Project for Oncology Research (CSPOR); Public Health Research Foundation,Comprehensive Support Project for Oncology Research (CSPOR); Public Health Research Foundation,"This study was funded by the Comprehensive Support Project for Oncology Research (CSPOR) and the Comprehensive Support Project for Health Outcomes Research (CSP-HOR) of the Public Health Research Foundation.

We appropriately modify the definition of finitely effective debt constraints, introduced by Levine and Zame (1996) (see also Levine and Zame (2002)), to encompass models with limited commitment, default penalties and collateral. Along this line, we introduce in the setting of Araujo et al. (2002), Kubler and Schmedders (2003) and Pascoa and Seghir (2009) the concept of actions with finite equivalent payoffs. We show that, independent of the level of default penalties, restricting plans to have finite equivalent payoffs rules out Ponzi schemes and guarantees the existence of an equilibrium that is compatible with the minimal ability to borrow and lend that we expect in our model. An interesting feature of our debt constraints is that they give rise to budget sets that coincide with the standard budget sets of economies having a collateral structure but no penalties (as defined in Araujo et al. (2002)). This illustrates the hidden relation between finitely effective debt constraints and collateral requirements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on a panel dataset of 207 Indonesian districts over the period from 2001 to 2004. We show that district public health spending is largely driven by central government transfers, with an elasticity of around 0.9. We find a positive effect of public health spending on utilization of outpatient care in the public sector for the poorest two quartiles. We find no evidence that public expenditures crowd out utilization of private services or household health spending. Our analysis suggests that increased public health spending improves targeting to the poor, as behavioural changes in public health care utilization are pro-poor. Nonetheless, most of the benefits of the additional spending accrued to existing users of services, as initial utilization shares outweigh the behavioural responses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this article is to develop a questionnaire that captures the time lost from work due to a health problem and job and workplace characteristics so that the value of productivity loss to society can be calculated. Methods: First, a questionnaire battery was developed by selecting items from existing productivity questionnaires. Next, items with similar content were identified and duplications were eliminated. Third, the draft questionnaire's feasibility was pretested in a focus group (n = 15). Finally, after appropriate refinements, its applicability was tested in 140 employed patients with rheumatoid arthritis recruited from a cohort in the United Kingdom. Multipliers relating the wage to marginal productivity were also derived using the questionnaire. Results: The final questionnaire includes items on employment status; absenteeism; presenteeism; unpaid work; and job characteristics, which includes questions on team dynamics, availability of substitutes and their substitutability, time sensitivity, and compensation mechanisms. The importance of incorporating these questions demonstrated that when one employee was absent, or present at work but unable to work at full capacity, the consequent output loss could exceed the output of the employee alone. Multipliers were shown to be greater than one and represented the excess output loss. Conclusions: The new questionnaire enabled the job and workplace characteristics to be captured so that the actual productivity loss at the societal level attributable to absenteeism and presenteeism could be valued.","[Zhang, Wei; Bansback, Nick; Anis, Aslam H.] St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada; [Zhang, Wei; Bansback, Nick; Anis, Aslam H.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Boonen, Annelies] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Boonen, Annelies] Caphri Res Inst, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands",St. Paul's Hospital; University of British Columbia; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Anis, AH (通讯作者)，St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, 620-1081 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada.",aslam.anis@ubc.ca,"Zhang, Wei/P-3692-2016","Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-7988-1979; Bansback, Nick/0000-0002-1510-3462","Pfizer; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals; Healthcare Commission, UK; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canadian Arthritis Network","Pfizer(Pfizer); Wyeth Pharmaceuticals(Wyeth); Healthcare Commission, UK; Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Arthritis Network","This study was supported by Pfizer through a grant to the Arthritis Research Centre of Canada, where Aslam H.

A number of studies have investigated the long-lasting effects of poor health during childhood on later-in-life outcomes. However, this evidence ignores how parents respond to the onset of health conditions. Do their investments reinforce the health condition? Or compensate, or behave neutrally? If parents change their investments, the relationship between early health and later outcomes combines the biological effect and the investment responses. To address this question, I use within-sibling variation in the incidence of health conditions to control for selection from unobserved household heterogeneity. Parents invest, on average, 0.16 standard deviations less in children with mental conditions relative to their healthy siblings, using a measure of investment that includes time and resources. On the contrary, when children have a physical condition, parental investments do not differ across siblings. Results are robust to alternative measures of health conditions and the inclusion of child fixed effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The GMM estimation methods are designed with the fixed individual and time effects eliminated from the model, and are computationally tractable even under circumstances where the ML approach would be either infeasible or computationally complicated. The ML approach would be infeasible if the spatial weights matrix is not row-normalized while the time effects are eliminated, and would be computationally intractable if there are multiple spatial weights matrices in the model; also, consistency of the MLE would require T to be large and not small relative to n if the fixed effects are jointly estimated with other parameters of interest. The GMM approach can overcome all these difficulties. We use exogenous and predetermined variables as instruments for linear moments, along with several levels of their neighboring variables and additional quadratic moments. We stack up the data and construct the best linear and quadratic moment conditions. An alternative approach is to use separate moment conditions for each period, which gives rise to many moments estimation. We show that these GMM estimators are root nT consistent, asymptotically normal, and can be relatively efficient. We compare these approaches on their finite sample performance by Monte Carlo.

We propose to investigate the relationship for each condition or disease area by using patient-level data. We examine health outcomes as a function of costs and other patient-level variables by using the following: (1) two-stage residual inclusion with Murphy-Topel adjustment to address costs being endogenous to health outcomes, (2) random-effects models in both stages to correct for correlation between observation, and (3) Cox proportional hazard models in the second stage to ensure that the available information is exploited. To demonstrate its application, data on mortality following hospital treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from a large German sickness fund were used. Provider reimbursement was used as a proxy for treatment costs. We relied on the Ontario Acute Myocardial Infarction Mortality Prediction Rules as a disease-specific risk-adjustment instrument. A total of 12,284 patients with treatment for AMI in 2004-2006 were included. The results showed a reduction in hospital costs by euro100 to increase the hazard of dying, that is, mortality, by 0.43%. The negative association between costs and mortality confirms that decreased resource input leads to worse outcomes for treatment after AMI.

This paper is motivated by the Bayesian non-parametric modelling of the dependence between clustering effects in multiple time series analysis. We follow a Dirichlet process mixture approach and define a new class of multivariate dependent Pitman-Yor processes (DPY). The proposed DPY are represented in terms of vectors of stick-breaking processes which determine dependent clustering structures in the time series. We follow a hierarchical specification of the DPY base measure to account for various degrees of information pooling across the series. We discuss some theoretical properties of the DPY and use them to define Bayesian non-parametric repeated measurement and vector autoregressive models.

Recent legislation liberalised closing times with the object of reducing social problems thought associated with drinking to beat the clock. Indeed, using both difference in difference and synthetic control approaches we show that one consequence of this liberalisation was a decrease in traffic accidents. This decrease is heavily concentrated among younger drivers. Moreover, we provide evidence that the effect was most pronounced in the hours of the week directly affected by the liberalisation: late nights and early mornings on weekends. This evidence survives a series of robustness checks and suggests at least one socially positive consequence of extending bar hours. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

The present value of an expected cancer case that occurs after a one decade latency period is $10.85m, consistent with a cancer premium that is 21% greater than the median value of a statistical life estimates for acute fatalities. This cancer premium is smaller than the premium proposed for policy analyses in the UK and the USA. There is also a greater premium for policies that reduce cancer risks to zero and for risk reductions affecting those who perceive themselves to have a greater than average probability of having cancer.

J,"Stock, JH; Watson, MW",,,,"Stock, James H.; Watson, Mark W.",,,Estimating turning points using large data sets,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BUSINESS-CYCLE; MODE,"Dating business cycles entails ascertaining economy-wide turning points. Broadly speaking, there are two approaches in the literature. The first approach, which dates to Burns and Mitchell (1946), is to identify turning points individually in a large number of series, then to look for a common date that could be called an aggregate turning point. The second approach, which has been the focus of more recent academic and applied work, is to look for turning points in a few, or just one, aggregate. This paper examines these two approaches to the identification of turning points. We provide a nonparametric definition of a turning point (an estimand) based on a population of time series. This leads to estimators of turning points, sampling distributions, and standard errors for turning points based on a sample of series. We consider both simple random sampling and stratified sampling. The empirical part of the analysis is based on a data set of 270 disaggregated monthly real economic time series for the US, 1959-2010.

We show that any priority rule which treats agents symmetrically - anonymity - respects some form of coherence across collective decision problems - reinforcement - and only depends on peak information - peak-only - is a weighted majoritarian rule.

For a given set of potential predictor variables we combine forecasts from all possible linear regression models that keep the number of predictors fixed. We explore how the choice of model complexity, as measured by the number of included predictor variables, can be used to trade off the bias and variance of the forecast errors, generating a setup akin to the efficient frontier known from modern portfolio theory. In an application to predictability of stock returns, we find that combinations of subset regressions can produce more accurate forecasts than conventional approaches based on equal-weighted forecasts (which fail to account for the dimensionality of the underlying models), combinations of univariate forecasts, or forecasts generated by methods such as bagging, ridge regression or Bayesian Model Averaging.

We use exogenous variation in the interview dates of the 2008 Health and Retirement Study to assess the impact of large wealth losses on mental health among older U.S. adults. We compare cross-wave changes in wealth and mental health for respondents interviewed before and after the October 2008 stock market crash. We find that the crash reduced wealth and increased feelings of depression and use of antidepressant drugs, and that these effects were largest among respondents with high levels of stock holdings prior to the crash. These results suggest that sudden wealth losses cause immediate declines,in subjective measures of mental health. However, we find no evidence that wealth losses lead to increases in clinically-validated measures of depressive symptoms or indicators of depression. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
