Methods: A Markov-model that models the course of dementia with respect to typical care setting transitions was derived. Model data and parameters were retrieved by literature reviews. A deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for parameter uncertainty. Results: In the base case, the expected present value of remaining lifetime costs is 25,326 for each cohort member. As a function of effectiveness, pharmaceutical interventions may reduce the costs by 2% to 13% and psychosocial interventions come with savings of 1% to 10%. A structural intervention-promoting group living as a substitute for nursing home care increases costs by 2% to 8%. Sensitivity analyses indicate high variance and variability of results, as well as valuation of informal care being a crucial parameter. Conclusions: There are economic benefits of delayed tansitions to institutional settings, especially from the viewpoint of statutory care insurances, but these do unlikely exceed intervention costs. Thus, further intervention effects should be considered. Ultimately, concentrating research on preventive and protective factors of dementia could lead to an efficient intervention from every perspective.","[Lueke, Sven; Flessa, Steffen] Chair Business Adm & Hlth Care Management, Fac Law & Business Adm, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Lueke, Sven; Hoffmann, Wolfgang] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, Greifswald, Germany; [Hoffmann, Wolfgang] Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Greifswald, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE); Greifswald Medical School,"Lueke, S (通讯作者)，Chair Business Adm & Hlth Care Management, Fac Law & Business Adm, Friedrich Loffler Str 70, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",sven.lueke@rub.de,"Flessa, Steffen/AEO-9609-2022",,,,,,29,2,3,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2014,17,6.0,,,,,679,685,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.06.008,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AP8XS,25236991.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342363300003,0

We prove a converse for any continuous random variable Y (or a reasonable approximation to a continuous random variable) so that if X and Y X are equally distributed modulo 1 and Y is independent of X then X is uniformly distributed modulo 1 (or approximates the uniform distribution equally reasonably).

Methods: COPD modeling groups simulated four hypothetical interventions with their model and compared the results with a reference scenario of no intervention. The four interventions modeled assumed 1) 20% reduction in decline in lung function, 2) 25% reduction in exacerbation frequency, 3) 10% reduction in all-cause mortality, and 4) all these effects combined. The interventions were simulated for a 5-year and lifetime horizon with standardization, if possible, for sex, age, COPD severity, smoking status, exacerbation frequencies, mortality due to other causes, utilities, costs, and discount rates. Furthermore, uncertainty around the outcomes of intervention four was compared. Results: Seven out of nine contacted COPD modeling groups agreed to participate. The 5-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the most comprehensive intervention, intervention four, was (sic)17,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for two models, (sic)25,000 to (sic)28,000/QALY for three models, and (sic)47,000/QALY for the remaining two models. Differences in the ICERs could mainly be explained by differences in input values for disease progression, exacerbation-related mortality, and all-cause mortality, with high input values resulting in low ICERs and vice versa. Lifetime results were mainly affected by the input values for mortality. The probability of intervention four to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay value of (sic)50,000/QALY was 90% to 100% for five models and about 70% and 50% for the other two models, respectively. Conclusions: Mortality was the most important factor determining the differences in cost-effectiveness outcomes between models.","[Hoogendoorn, Martine; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P. M.

This study compares index scores generated from contemporaneous EQ-5D (3-level version) and SF-6D (SF-36 version) responses using scoring algorithms derived from independently-conducted Australian population-representative discrete choice experiments (DCEs), providing the first comparative analysis of health state valuations using the same method of valuation across the full value sets. Methods: EQ-5D and SF-6D responses from seven patient data sets were transformed into health state valuations using published DCE-derived scoring algorithms. The empirical comparative evaluation consisted of graphical illustration of the location and spread of index scores, reporting of basic descriptive statistics, exploration of between-measure differences in mean index scores, and analysis of agreement. Results: Compared with previously published findings regarding the comparability of conventional EQ-5D and SF-6D index scores, health state valuations from the DCE-derived scoring procedures showed that agreement between scores remained fair (intraclass correlation coefficient values across the seven data sets ranged from 0.375 to 0.615). Mean SF-6D scores were significantly lower than the respective mean EQ-5D score across all patient groups (mean difference for the whole sample = 0.253). Conclusions: The magnitude of disagreement previously reported between EQ-5D and SF-6D index scores is not ameliorated through the application of DCE-derived value sets; sizeable discrepancies remain. These findings suggest that differences between EQ-5D and SF-6D index scores persist because of their respective descriptive systems. Further research is required to explore the implications of variations in the descriptive systems of preference-based instruments.","[Whitehurst, David G.

These frameworks include classical, distributively unweighted cost-benefit analysis-i.e., the value per statistical life (VSL) approach and various social welfare functions (SWFs). The SWFs are either utilitarian or prioritarian, applied to policy choice under risk in either an ex post or ex ante manner. We examine the conditions on individual utility and on the SWF under which these frameworks display sensitivity to wealth and to baseline risk. Moreover, we discuss whether these frameworks satisfy related properties that have received some attention in the literature, namely equal value of risk reduction, preference for risk equity, and catastrophe aversion. We show that the particular manner in which VSL ranks risk-reduction measures is not necessarily shared by other welfarist frameworks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Each profile of initial capital stock in that set generates a complete infinite horizon feasible capital path. From that characterization, we prove the existence of a minimum value for the scrapping time of the machines compatible with the rate of technological progress. Moreover, for each level of capital productivity, there exists an upper bound for the technological progress which allows the existence of feasible capital paths with full employment. Finally, we transform the infinite horizon dynamic programming problem into one of finite dimension. We use this to find the optimal lifetime for the machines as well as the optimal composition of the initial capital stocks. A numerical example shows that, in accordance with the infinite horizon approach to the problem, the increase in the rate of technological progress leads to a decrease in optimal scrapping time of capital goods.

However, the compensation of short-lived individuals has remained so far largely unexplored, probably because it appears infeasible. Indeed, short-lived agents can hardly be identified ex ante, and cannot be compensated ex post. We argue that, despite those difficulties, a compensation can be carried out by encouraging early consumption in the life cycle. In a model with heterogeneous preferences and longevities, we show how a specific social criterion can be derived from intuitive principles, and we study the corresponding optimal policy under various informational assumptions.

The dominant estimation methods, in this context, are based on various filters, such as the Kalman filter, that are applicable when the models are cast in state space representations. This paper introduces a new class of autoregressive bounded processes that decompose a time series into a persistent random attractor, a time varying autoregressive component, and martingale difference errors. The paper examines, rigorously, alternative kernel based, nonparametric estimation approaches for such models and derives their basic properties. These estimators have long been studied in the context of deterministic structural change, but their use in the presence of stochastic time variation is novel. The proposed inference methods have desirable properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality and allow a tractable studentization. In extensive Monte Carlo and empirical studies, we find that the methods exhibit very good small sample properties and can shed light on important empirical issues such as the evolution of inflation persistence and the purchasing power parity (PPP) hypothesis.

We focus on avoidable hospitalisations for diabetic patients for whom GPs receive additional payments exceeding capitation. We estimate a panel count data model to test the hypothesis that those patients under the responsibility of GPs receiving a higher share of their income through ad-hoc payments, are less likely to experience avoidable hospitalisations. Our findings indicate that financial transfers may help improve the quality of care, even when they are not based on the ex-post verification of performance. The estimated effect indicates that, at sample averages, an increase of 100 Euros of the financial incentives paid to GPs (around 17% of the yearly payment received by GPs for diabetes programmes) is expected to reduce the number of diabetic ACSCs by 1%, around 100 cases when projected on the entire region.

We call these Sorel probability measures rational and introduce the notion of a rational belief hierarchy, where the first order beliefs are described by a rational measure over the fundamental space of uncertainty, the second order beliefs are described by a rational measure over the product of the fundamental space of uncertainty and the opponent's first order rational beliefs, and so on. Then, we derive the corresponding rational type space model, thus providing a Bayesian representation of rational belief hierarchies. Our main result shows that this type-based representation has the counterintuitive property that some rational types are associated with non-rational beliefs over the product of the fundamental space of uncertainty and the opponent's types, thus implying that the agent may attach an irrational probability to some Borel event even if she has a rational belief hierarchy.

It considers a society in which individuals experience utility from consumption of food and non-food, the state of their health, and the evaluation of their appearance by others. The theory explains under which conditions poor persons are more prone to be overweight although eating is expensive and it shows how obesity occurs as a social phenomenon such that body mass continues to rise long after the initial cause (e.g. a lower price of food) is gone. The paper investigates the determinants of a steady state at which the median person is overweight and how an originally lean society arrives at such a steady state. Extensions of the theory towards dietary choice and the possibility to exercise in order to lose weight demonstrate robustness of the basic mechanism and provide further interesting results.

Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) has developed as an alternative with more descriptive validity. However, CPT's full function had not yet been quantified in the health domain. This paper is therefore the first to simultaneously measure utility of life duration, probability weighting, and loss aversion in this domain. We observe loss aversion and risk aversion for gains and losses, which for gains can be explained by probabilistic pessimism. Utility for gains is almost linear. For losses, we find less weighting of probability 112 and concave utility. This contrasts with the common finding of convex utility for monetary losses. However, CPT was proposed to explain choices among lotteries involving monetary outcomes. Life years are arguably very different from monetary outcomes and need not generate convex utility for losses. Moreover, utility of life duration reflects discounting, causing concave utility.

The experiment includes treatments across different default choices and organ allocation rules inspired by the donor registration systems applied in different countries. Our results indicate that the opt-out with priority rule system generates the largest increase in organ donation relative to an opt-in only program. However, sizeable gains are achievable using either a priority rule or opt-out program separately, with the opt-out rule generating approximately 80% of the benefits achieved under a priority rule program.

We study employed married women, comparing the labor supply responses to new breast cancer diagnoses of women dependent on their own employment for health insurance with the responses of women who are less dependent on their own employment for health insurance, because of actual or potential access to health insurance through their spouse's employer. We find evidence that women who depend on their own job for health insurance reduce their labor supply by less after a diagnosis of breast cancer. In the estimates that best control for unobservables associated with health insurance status, the hours reduction for women who continue to work is 8 to 11% smaller.

The analysis is further complicated when demand data are obtained from a survey in which the reporting period does not coincide with the payment period. We illustrate these issues using as an example a health care reform in Germany that imposed a per-quarter fee of Euro10 for doctor visits and additionally set an out-of-pocket maximum. This co-payment structure results in an effective spot' price for a doctor visit that decreases over time within each payment period. Taking this variation into account, we find a substantial reform effectespecially so for young adults. Overall, the number of doctor visits decreased by around 9% in the young population. The probability of visiting a physician in any given quarter decreased by around 4 to 8 percentage points.

The 21-gene assay can potentially aid such decisions, but costs US $4175 per patient. Adjuvant! Online is a freely available decision aid. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the 21-gene assay in conjunction with Adjuvant! Online, and of providing adjuvant chemotherapy conditional upon risk classification. Methods: A probabilistic Markov decision model simulated risk classification, treatment, and the natural history of breast cancer in a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu-negative early breast cancer. Cost-effectiveness was considered from an Ontario public-payer perspective by deriving the lifetime incremental cost (2012 Canadian dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for each strategy, and the probability each strategy is cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY. Results: The 21-gene assay has an incremental cost per QALY in patients at low, intermediate, or high Adjuvant Online! risk of $22,440 (probability cost-effective 78.46%), $2,526 (99.40%), or $1,111 (99.82%), respectively. In patients at low (high) 21-gene assay risk, adjuvant chemotherapy increases (reduces) costs and worsens (improves) health outcomes. For patients at intermediate 21-gene assay risk and low, intermediate, or high Adjuvant! Online risk, chemotherapy has an incremental cost per QALY of $44,088 (50.59%), $1,776 (77.65%), or $1,778 (82.31%), respectively. Conclusions: The 21-gene assay appears cost-effective, regardless of Adjuvant! Online risk. Adjuvant chemotherapy appears cost-effective for patients at intermediate or high 21-gene assay risk, although this finding is uncertain in patients at intermediate 21-gene assay and low Adjuvant!

Methods: The revised standard Measurement and Valuation of Health protocol was followed. Twenty-five health states, divided into three groups and given to 450 subjects, were selected to obtain 300 observations per state. Subjects aged 18 to 75 years were recruited to be representative of the Italian general adult population for age, sex, and geographical distribution. To improve efficiency, face-to-face interviews were conducted by using the Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing approach. Several random effects regression models were tested to predict the full set of EQ-5D questionnaire health states. Model selection was based on logical consistency of the estimates, sign and magnitude of the regression coefficients, goodness of fit, and parsimony. Results: The model that satisfied the criteria of logical consistency and was more efficient includes 10 main effect dummy variables for the EQ-5D questionnaire domain levels and the D1 interaction term, which accounts for the number of dimensions at levels 2 or 3 beyond the first. This model has an R-2 of 0.389 and a mean absolute error of 0.03, which are comparable to or better than those of models used in other countries. The utility estimates after state 11111 range from 0.92 (21111) to -0.38 (33333). Italian utility estimates are higher than those estimated in the United Kingdom and Spain and used so far to assess QALYs and conduct cost-utility evaluations in Italy. Conclusions: A specific value set is now available to calculate QALYs for the conduction of health economic studies targeted at the Italian health care system.","[Scalone, Luciana; Cortesi, Paolo A.; Ciampichini, Roberta; Belisari, Andrea; D'Angiolella, Lucia S.; Mantovani, Lorenzo G.] CHARTA Fdn, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Scalone, Luciana; Cortesi, Paolo A.; Cesana, Giancarlo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Ctr Publ Hlth CESP, Monza, Italy; [Mantovani, Lorenzo G.] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Clin Med & Surg, Naples, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Naples Federico II,"Scalone, L (通讯作者)，CHARTA Fdn, Via Viscont di Modrone 18, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",luciana.scalone@fondazionecharta.org,"Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni/AAC-4263-2021; Cortesi, Paolo Angelo/AAD-7926-2020","Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni/0000-0003-3866-8199; Cortesi, Paolo Angelo/0000-0001-5241-4473",CHARTA Foundation; EuroQoL group,CHARTA Foundation; EuroQoL group,Source of financial support: This work was funded by the CHARTA Foundation and the EuroQoL group.,,50,117,119,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2013,16,5.0,,,,,814,822,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.04.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CL,23947975.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325466600015,0

In the first case, characterized by a positive investment in quality, the lack of self-control may tend to reduce fertility. In the second case, it is possible that the lack of self-control leads to both no investment in quality and a higher fertility rate. It is also proved that if parents cannot commit on their investment in quality, a small change of parameters may lead to a jump in fertility and education. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Lead time TTO' (LT-TTO) was recently introduced to overcome the problem. We tested different specifications of LT-TTO in comparison with TTO in a within-subject design. We elicited preferences for six health states and employed an intertemporal ranking task as a benchmark to test the validity of the two methods. We also tested constant proportional trade-offs (CPTO), while correcting for discounting, and the effect of extending the lead time if a health state is considered substantially WTD. LT-TTO produced lower values for BTD states and higher values for WTD states. The validity of CPTO varied across tasks, but it was higher for LT-TTO than for TTO. Results indicate that the ratio of lead time to disease time has a greater impact on results than the total duration of the time frame. The intertemporal ranking task could not discriminate between TTO and LT-TTO. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Attema, Arthur E.; Versteegh, Matthijs M.; Oppe, Mark; Brouwer, Werner B.

In this paper, we propose an original one-step R-estimation method and investigate its asymptotic performances under stable densities. Contrary to traditional least squares, the proposed R-estimators remain root-n consistent (the optimal rate) under the whole family of stable distributions, irrespective of their asymmetry and tail index. While parametric stable-likelihood estimation, due to the absence of a closed form for stable densities, is quite cumbersome, our method allows us to construct estimators reaching the parametric efficiency bounds associated with any prescribed values (alpha(0), b(0)) of the tail index alpha and skewness parameter b, while preserving root-n consistency under any (alpha, b) as well as under usual light-tailed densities. The method furthermore avoids all forms of multidimensional argmin computation. Simulations confirm its excellent finite-sample performances. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The literature also reports disparate rates of ventilator-assisted pneumonia (VAP) as side effects of these treatments. We compared the cost-effectiveness of these two prophylactic pharmacological options. Methods: We constructed a decision tree with a 60-day time horizon for patients at high risk for developing SUB, receiving either PPIs or H2RAs. For each treatment strategy, patients could be in one of three states of health: SUB, VAP, or no complication. Contemporary, clinically relevant probabilities were obtained from a broad literature search. Costs were estimated by using a representative US countrywide database. A third-party payer perspective was adopted. Cost-effectiveness and univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Probabilities of SUB and VAP were 1.3% and 10.3% for PPIs versus 6.6% and 10.3% for H2RAs, respectively. Lengths of stay and per diem costs were 24 days and US $2764 for SUB, 42 days and US $3310 for VAP, and 14 days and US $2993 for patients without complications. Average costs per no complication were US $58,700 for PPIs and US $63,920 for H2RAs. The H2RA strategy was dominated by PPIs. Sensitivity analysis showed that these findings were sensitive to VAP rates but PPIs remain cost-effective. The acceptability curve shows the stability of the probabilistic results according to varying willingness-to-pay values. Conclusion: PPI prophylaxis is the most efficient prophylactic strategy in patients at high risk of developing SUB when compared with using H2RAs.","[Barkun, Alan N.; Adam, Viviane; Martel, Myriam] McGill Univ, Div Gastroenterol, Ctr Hlth, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [Barkun, Alan N.] McGill Univ, Div Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Ctr Hlth, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [Bardou, Marc] CHU Dijon, INSERM CIC P 803, Dijon, France; [Bardou, Marc] Univ Bourgogne, Dijon, France",McGill University; McGill University; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); CHU Dijon Bourgogne; Universite de Bourgogne,"Barkun, AN (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Div Gastroenterol, Ctr Hlth, Montreal Gen Hosp Site,Room D7-346,1650 Cedar Ave, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada.",alan.barkun@muhc.mcgill.ca,"Barkun, Alan N/JDV-6782-2023; , Myriam Martel/HKN-3858-2023; Martel, Myriam/ABB-3862-2020","Barkun, Alan N/0000-0002-1798-5526;",,,,,65,33,40,0,39,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2013,16,1.0,,,,,14,22,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.08.2213,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,077WN,23337211.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314060200003,0

During the period of our analysis, changes in the University's premium contribution rules led to substantial price changes. A key feature of this natural experiment is that individuals who had retired before a certain date were exempted from having to pay any premium contributions. This grandfathering creates quasi-experimental variation that is ideal for estimating the effect of price. Using regression discontinuity methods, we compare the plan choices of individuals who retired just after the grandfathering cutoff date and were therefore exposed to significant price changes to the choices of a control group of individuals who retired just before that date and therefore did not experience the price changes. The results indicate a statistically significant effect of price, with a $10 increase in monthly premium contributions leading to a 2 to 3 percentage point decrease in a plan's market share.

Promotional effort results in the endogenous formation of two consumer groups: brand loyal and non-brand loyal ones. We show that advertising intensities are strategic substitutes, with the better quality drugs being the ones that are most advertised. This positive association stems from the higher rents that firms can extract from consumers whose brand loyalty is endogenously determined by promotional effort. The model's main results on advertising and pricing strategies are taken to the data. The latter consists of product level data on prices and quantities, product level advertising data, as well as the qualitative information on drug quality contained in the Orange Book compiled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The empirical results provide strong support to the model's predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to estimate QALE loss due to five chronic diseases diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, heart disease, and stroke. Methods: Health-related quality of life scores were from the 1993-2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Using age-specific deaths from the Compressed Mortality File, this study constructed life tables to calculate losses in life expectancy and QALE due to each of the five diseases from 1993 through 2009 and for 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Results: In 2009, the individual-level QALE loss for diabetic people, compared with nondiabetic people, was 11.1 years; for those with hypertension, 6.3 years; for those with asthma, 7.0 years; for those with heart disease, 10.3 years; and for those with stroke, 12.4 years. At the population level, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, heart disease, and stroke contributed 1.9, 2.2, 0.8, 1.2, and 0.8 years of population QALE loss at age 18 years, respectively. Conclusions: Persons with each of the five diseases had significantly lower life expectancy and QALE. Because the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension has increased significantly in the United States in the last two decades, the burdens of these two conditions, measured by population QALE losses, had increased 83% and 29% from 1993 to 2009, respectively. Also, by examining changes in population QALE loss at different ages, policymakers can identify age groups most affected by particular diseases and develop the most cost-effective interventions by focusing on these groups.","[Jia, Haomiao] Columbia Univ, Dept Biostat, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jia, Haomiao] Columbia Univ, Sch Nursing, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zack, Matthew M.; Thompson, William W.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Adult & Community Hlth, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Jia, HM (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Biostat, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, 617 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",hj2198@columbia.edu,"Jia, Haomiao/AAU-8276-2021",,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [200-2010-M-35363],Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA),This study (H.J.) was supported by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contract (no. 200-2010-M-35363).

The estimation procedures are based on relationships between distribution free models with a conditional median restriction and parametric models (such as Probit/Logit) exhibiting (multiplicative) heteroskedasticity. The first proposed estimator is based on the observational equivalence between the two models, and is a semiparametric sieve estimator (see, e.g. Gallant and Nychka (1987), Ai and Chen (2003) and Chen et al. (2005)) for the regression coefficients, based on maximizing standard Logit/Probit criterion functions, such as NLLS and MLE. This procedure has the advantage that choice probabilities and regression coefficients are estimated simultaneously. The second proposed procedure is based on the equivalence between existing semiparametric estimators for the conditional median model (Manski, 1975, 1985; Horowitz, 1992) and the standard parametric (Probit/Logit) NLLS estimator. This estimator has the advantage of being implementable with standard software packages such as Stata. Distribution theory is developed for both estimators and a Monte Carlo study indicates they both perform well in finite samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Positive correlations have been found between clinical and economic performance. Although there is still controversy regarding what kind of management and which managers should lead health care organizations and health systems, we now have interesting evidence to analyze. Starting with a systematic review of the literature, this article presents and discusses the streams of knowledge regarding how management can influence the quality and sustainability of health systems and organizations. Through the analysis of 37 studies, we found that the performance of health care systems and organizations seems to be correlated with management practices, leadership, manager characteristics, and cultural attributes that are associated with managerial values and approaches. There is also evidence that health care organizations run by doctors perform better than others. Finally, we provide a roadmap that indicates how the relationship between the management and performance of health systems and organizations can be further and more effectively investigated.

Being identified as a defining feature of globalization affecting health, trade liberalization is analyzed as a complex and multidimensional influence on the implementation of UHC. The analysis adopts a systems-thinking approach and refers to the six building blocks of World Health Organizations current framework for action, emphasizing their interconnectedness. While offering new opportunities to increase access to health information and care, in the absence of global governance mechanisms ensuring adequate health protection and promotion, global trade tends to have negative effects on health systems capacity to ensure UHC, both by causing higher demand and by interfering with the interconnected functioning of health systems building blocks. The prevention of such an impact and the effective implementation of UHC would highly benefit from a more consistent commitment and stronger leadership by the World Health Organization in protecting health in global policymaking fora in all sectors.

We show that these social choice functions (which we call generalized random dictatorships) are induced by probability distributions on voter sequences of length equal to the number of components. They induce a fixed probability distribution on the product set of voter peaks. The marginal probability distribution over every component is a random dictatorship. Our results generalize the classic random dictatorship result in Gibbard (1977) and the decomposability results for strategy-proof deterministic social choice functions for multi-dimensional models with separable preferences obtained in LeBreton and Sen (1999).

In this context, Bayesian Model Averaging presents a formal Bayesian solution to dealing with model uncertainty. Our main interest here is the effect of the prior on the results, such as posterior inclusion probabilities of regressors and predictive performance. We combine a Binomial-Beta prior on model size with a g-prior on the coefficients of each model. In addition, we assign a hyperprior to g, as the choice of g has been found to have a large impact on the results. For the prior on g, we examine the Zellner-Siow prior and a class of Beta shrinkage priors, which covers most choices in the recent literature. We propose a benchmark Beta prior, inspired by earlier findings with fixed g, and show it leads to consistent model selection. The effect of this prior structure on penalties for complexity and lack of fit is described in some detail. Inference is conducted through a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler over model space and g. We examine the performance of the various priors in the context of simulated and real data. For the latter, we consider two important applications in economics, namely cross-country growth regression and returns to schooling. Recommendations to applied users are provided.

Aim: To establish the relative importance of factors that influence decision making when managing symptoms of differing severity, to establish how people trade between these factors, and to estimate the monetary value placed on different management types. Design: Discrete choice experiment. Setting: UK online research panel. Method: Successive members of an online panel were invited to participate until 480 discrete choice experiment questionnaires were completed. Relative preferences for managing three symptom scenarios of varying severity were measured. Symptom management was described by three characteristics (management type, availability, and cost). Preferences for ways of managing symptoms were measured by using conditional logit analysis. Results: A total of 98.5% of the completed questionnaires were valid (473 of 480 respondents). People preferred to manage minor symptoms by self-care or by visiting a pharmacy and were willing to pay 21.58 pound and 19.06 pound, respectively, to do so. For managing moderately severe symptoms, people preferred to consult a general practitioner and were willing to pay 34.86 pound for this option. People preferred to manage potentially very severe symptoms by consulting a general practitioner and were willing to pay 73.08 pound to do so. Respondents were willing to trade between management types; options less preferred became more attractive when waiting time and cost were reduced. Conclusion: People value self-care, supported self-care, and general practitioner consultation differently depending on the type of symptoms. Manipulating costs to users and waiting times for different services could allow policymakers to influence the services people choose when managing symptoms.","[Rennie, Lisa; Porteous, Terry] Univ Aberdeen, Acad Primary Care, Conon Bridge IV7 8AG, Ross Shire, Scotland; [Ryan, Mandy] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Rennie, L (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Acad Primary Care, Conon Bridge IV7 8AG, Ross Shire, Scotland.",l.a.rennie.06@aberdeen.ac.uk,"Porteous, Terry/D-1531-2010",,MRC/ESRC [G0800069]; University of Aberdeen; Medical Research Council [G0800069] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0800069] Funding Source: UKRI,MRC/ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); University of Aberdeen; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Source of financial support: This research was funded through a fellowship awarded to Dr. Terry Porteous (MRC/ESRC Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Fellowship, Ref: G0800069), with additional financial support from the BScMedSci programme at the University of Aberdeen.

We characterize the position value for network situations along the lines of the characterization of the Shapley value by Shapley (1953). In contrast to previous attempts to provide such an axiomatization, we require no condition on the underlying network. The reason for this is that we exploit the additional flexibility of network situations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Modelers employ quantitative methods to structure the clinical, epidemiological, and economic evidence base and gain qualitative insight to assist decision makers in making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider. The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to decision uncertainty and the relationship to value of information analysis. The article also makes extensive recommendations around the reporting of uncertainty, in terms of both deterministic sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods. Expected value of perfect information is argued to be the most appropriate presentational technique, alongside cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, for representing decision uncertainty from probabilistic analysis.","[Briggs, Andrew H.; Fenwick, Elisabeth A.

Methods: Within this three-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial, 390 community-dwelling patients aged 65 years or older with physician-diagnosed mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers were enrolled via 129 general practitioners in Middle Franconia, Germany. The intervention included general practitioners' training in dementia care and their recommendation of support groups and actively approaching caregiver counseling. Primary study end point was time to institutionalization over 2 years. In addition, long-term intervention effects were assessed over a time horizon of 4 years. Secondary end points included cognitive functioning, (instrumental) activities of daily living, burden of care-giving, and health-related quality of life after 2 years. Frailty models with strict intention-to-treat approach and mixed linear models were applied to account for cluster randomization. Health care costs were assessed from the societal perspective. Results: After 2 (4) years, 12% (24%) of the patients were institutionalized and another 21% (35%) died before institutionalization. No significant differences between study groups were observed with respect to time to institutionalization after 2 and 4 years (P 0.25 and 0.71, respectively). Secondary end points deteriorated, but differences were not significant between study groups. Almost 80% of the health care costs were due to informal care. Total annual costs amounted to more than (sic)47,000 per patient and did not differ between study arms. Conclusion: The intervention showed no effects on time to institutionalization and secondary outcomes.","[Menn, Petra] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Donath, Carolin; Graessel, Elmar] Psychiat Univ Clin Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany; [Lauterberg, Joerg] AOK, Fed Assoc, Berlin, Germany; [Marx, Peter] Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Mehlig, Hilmar] Eisai GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany; [Ruckdaeschel, Stephan] HealthEcon AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Vollmar, Horst Christian] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis, DZNE, Witten, Germany; [Vollmar, Horst Christian] Univ Witten Herdecke, Inst Gen Practice & Family Med, Witten, Germany; [Wunder, Sonja] AOK Bavaria Hlth insurer, Nurnberg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Pfizer; Eisai Co Ltd; Helmholtz Association; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE); Witten Herdecke University,"Menn, P (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",petra.menn@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Janson, Patrick/AAC-7581-2022; Leidl, Reiner M/B-7209-2009; Holle, Rolf/D-9333-2013; Leidl, Reiner/GQY-7389-2022; Vollmar, Horst Christian/HLX-0737-2023","Leidl, Reiner M/0000-0002-7115-7510; Vollmar, Horst Christian/0000-0002-0117-7188; Donath, Carolin/0000-0001-9502-861X",,,,,36,31,32,1,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,851,859,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999135.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800011,0

The aim of this article was to provide a series of consensus-based best practices regarding the process of model conceptualization. For the purpose of this series of articles, we consider the development of models whose purpose is to inform medical decisions and health-related resource allocation questions. We specifically divide the conceptualization process into two distinct components: the conceptualization of the problem, which converts knowledge of the health care process or decision into a representation of the problem, followed by the conceptualization of the model itself, which matches the attributes and characteristics of a particular modeling type with the needs of the problem being represented. Recommendations are made regarding the structure of the modeling team, agreement on the statement of the problem, the structure, perspective, and target population of the model, and the interventions and outcomes represented. Best practices relating to the specific characteristics of model structure and which characteristics of the problem might be most easily represented in a specific modeling method are presented. Each section contains a number of recommendations that were iterated among the authors, as well as among the wider modeling taskforce, jointly set up by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and the Society for Medical Decision Making.","[Roberts, Mark] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Med, Ctr Res Hlth Care, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Roberts, Mark] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Russell, Louise B.] Rutgers State Univ, Inst Hlth, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Russell, Louise B.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Paltiel, A.

The asymptotic behaviour of the sample moments is affected by the memory of the innovation process both in the form of the limiting distribution and, in the case of long range dependence, in the rate of convergence. However, this effect is not present in least squares regression theory as it is cancelled out by the interaction between the sample moments. As a result, the Cauchy regression theory of Phillips and Magdalinos (2007a) is invariant to the dependence structure of the innovation sequence.

Methods: Four-year panels were constructed from the 1997-2005 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey selected by self-report or claims-based diagnoses of diabetes in year 1 and use of statins in year 2 (N = 899). We computed the number of 30-day statin prescription fills, out-of-pocket and third-party drug costs, and Medicare Part A and Part B spending. Multivariate ordinary least squares regression models predicted statin fills as a function of out-of-pocket costs, and a generalized linear model with log link predicted Medicare spending as a function of number of fills, controlling for baseline characteristics. Estimated coefficients were used to simulate changes in fills associated with co-payment caps from $25 to $1 and to compute changes in third-party payments and Medicare cost offsets associated with incremental fills. Analyses were stratified by patient cardiovascular event risk. Results: A simulated out-of-pocket price of $25 [$1] increased plan drug spending by $340 [$794] and generated Medicare Part A/B savings of $262 [$531]; savings for high-risk patients were $558 [$1193], generating a net saving of $249 [$415]. Conclusions: Reducing statin co-payments for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes resulted in modestly increased use and reduced medical spending. The value-based insurance design simulation strategy met financial feasibility criteria but only for higher-risk patients.","[Shaffer, Thomas; Lloyd, Jennifer T.] Univ Maryland, Doctoral Program Gerontol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Davidoff, Amy; Stuart, Bruce; Shaffer, Thomas; Shoemaker, J.

Workers value flexibility, which is costly for employers to provide. We estimate the model on a sample of women extracted from the CPS. The model parameters are empirically identified because the accepted wage distributions of flexible and non-flexible jobs are directly related to the preference for flexibility parameters. Results show that more than one-third of women place a small, positive value on flexibility. Women with a college degree value flexibility more than women with only a high school degree. Counterfactual experiments show that flexibility has a substantial impact on the wage distribution but a negligible impact on the unemployment rate. These results suggest that wage and schooling differences between males and females may be importantly related to flexibility. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate a model of beneficiary demand for PDPs and use it to compute the loss of consumer surplus due to tightening PDP formularies to the level found in the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Under a generous assumption of cost savings attributed to increased bargaining leverage associated with exclusion of more drugs from formularies, we find the loss in consumer surplus to be smaller than the financial savings that could be shared between Medicare and beneficiaries.

The game of where to fish,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MULTIPLE EQUILIBRIA; MODELS; CONGESTION,"The global game with strategic substitutes and complements of Karp et al. (2007) is used to model the decision of where to fish. A complete information game is assumed, but the model is generalized to S > 1 sites. In this game, a fisherman's payoff depends on fish density in each site and the actions of other fishermen which can lead to congestion or agglomeration effects. Stable and unstable equilibria are characterized, as well as notions of equilibrium dominance. The model is applied to the Alaskan flatfish fishery by specifying a strategic interaction function (response to congestion) that is a non-linear function of the degree of congestion present in a given site. Results suggest that the interaction function may be non-monotonic in congestion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A questionnaire was administered via an internet-based survey to a random sample of adult US respondents. Each respondent answered questions about two different scenarios, each of which specified: one of four randomly selected diseases (Alzheimer's, arthritis, breast cancer, or prostate cancer); an ex ante risk of developing the disease (randomly designated 10 or 25%); and test accuracy (randomly designated perfect or not perfectly accurate). Willingness-to-pay (WTP) was elicited with a double-bounded, dichotomous-choice approach. Of 1463 respondents who completed the survey, most (70-88%, depending on the scenario) were inclined to take the test. Inclination to take the test was lower for Alzheimer's and higher for prostate cancer compared with arthritis, and rose somewhat with disease prevalence and for the perfect versus imperfect test [Correction made here after initial online publication.]. Median WTP varied from $109 for the imperfect arthritis test to $263 for the perfect prostate cancer test. Respondents' preferences for predictive testing, even in the absence of direct treatment consequences, reflected health and non-health related factors, and suggests that conventional cost-effectiveness analyses may underestimate the value of testing.

Since the usual rounding techniques, like in the divisor methods, may fail to satisfy these requirements, we propose to use integer linear programming (ILP) to provide at the same time rounding and satisfaction of the requirements. Using ILP makes central the choice of quotas to which the seats should be as close as possible. We investigate how the special requirements can affect the very definition of quotas, and define projective quotas. Finally we compare the various methods by using the EU Parliament data.

Different welfare criteria are applied to determine the optimal size of Social Security.

In contrast to existing procedures based on tightly parameterized models, our approach imposes much fewer structural assumptions, relying on extreme-value theory approximations together with short-maturity options. The new estimation approach explicitly allows the parameters characterizing the shape of the right and the left tails to differ, and importantly for the tail shape parameters to change over time. On implementing the procedures with a panel of S&P 500 options, our estimates clearly suggest the existence of highly statistically significant temporal variation in both of the tails. We further relate this temporal variation in the shape and the magnitude of the jump tails to the underlying return variation through the formulation of simple time series models for the tail parameters.

(2013) proved the nonemptiness of the alpha-core of a finite Bayesian game G(R) with Young measure strategies and nonatomic type spaces, without requiring that the expected payoffs be concave. Under the same hypotheses as theirs, we demonstrate that Scarf's method.(1971) works with some adjustments to prove the nonemptiness of the alpha-core of a similar game G(M) with pure strategies. We prove that the nonemptiness of the alpha-core of a G(M) is equivalent to that of its associated characteristic form game G(M)(C), that the core of G(M)(C) and hence the alpha-core of a G(M) is nonempty, and that the nonemptiness of the alpha-core of a G(M) is equivalent to that of a G(R), which clearly implies the result of Askoura et al. (2013). Our proofs hinge on an iterated version of Lyapunov's theorem for Young measures to purify partially as well as fully Young measure strategies in an expected payoff function, which is a main methodological contribution of this paper.

The method starts from a base forecast that might not satisfy the theoretical restrictions and forces it to satisfy the moment conditions using exponential tilting. Although exponential tilting has been considered before in a Bayesian context (Robertson et al. 2005), our main contributions are: (1) to adapt the method to a classical inferential context with out-of-sample evaluation objectives and parameter estimation uncertainty; and (2) to formally discuss the conditions under which the method delivers improvements in forecast accuracy. An empirical illustration which incorporates Euler conditions into forecasts produced by Bayesian vector autoregressions shows that the improvements in accuracy can be sizable and significant.

Examining 188 surgeons who performed 56,315 CABG surgeries in Pennsylvania between 2006 and 2010, we find that a surgeon's additional day away from the operating room raised patients' inpatient mortality by up to 0.067 percentage points (2.4% relative effect) but reduced total hospitalization costs by up to 0.59 percentage points. Among emergent patients treated by high-volume providers, where temporal distance is most plausibly exogenous, an additional day away raised mortality risk by 0.398 percentage points (11.4% relative effect) but reduced cost by up to 1.4 percentage points. This is consistent with the hypothesis that as temporal distance increases, surgeons are less likely to recognize and address life-threatening complications. Our estimates imply additional intraprocedural treatment intensity has a cost per life-year preserved of $7871-18,500, well within conventional cost-effectiveness cutoffs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Combining several historical and current datasets, we find that cohorts in utero during the pandemic are shorter as children/adolescents and less educated compared to other birth cohorts. We also find that they are more likely to have serious health problems including kidney disease, circulatory and respiratory problems, and diabetes in old age. Despite possible positive selection on health outcomes due to high infant mortality rates during this period (18%), our paper finds a strong negative impact of in utero exposure to influenza.

Cardiovascular disease causes approximately 35% of total UK deaths, at an estimated annual cost of 30 billion. The World Health Organization and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have recommended a reduction in the intake of salt in people's diets. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of four population health policies to reduce dietary salt intake on an English population to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: The validated IMPACT CHD model was used to quantify and compare four policies: 1) Change4Life health promotion campaign, 2) front-of-pack traffic light labeling to display salt content, 3) Food Standards Agency working with the food industry to reduce salt (voluntary), and 4) mandatory reformulation to reduce salt in processed foods. The effectiveness of these policies in reducing salt intake, and hence blood pressure, was determined by systematic literature review. The model calculated the reduction in mortality associated with each policy, quantified as life-years gained over 10 years. Policy costs were calculated using evidence from published sources. Health care costs for specific CHD patient groups were estimated. Costs were compared against a do nothing baseline. Results: All policies resulted in a life-year gain over the baseline. Change4life and labeling each gained approximately 1960 life-years, voluntary reformulation 14,560 life-years, and mandatory reformulation 19,320 life-years. Each policy appeared cost saving, with mandatory reformulation offering the largest cost saving, more than 660 million. Conclusions: All policies to reduce dietary salt intake could gain life years and reduce health care expenditure on coronary heart disease.","[Collins, Marissa; Mason, Helen] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Flaherty, Martin; Guzman-Castillo, Maria; Capewell, Simon] Univ Liverpool, Dept Publ Hlth & Policy, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Critchley, Julia] Univ London, Div Populat Hlth Sci & Educ PHSE St Georges, London, England",Glasgow Caledonian University; University of Liverpool; University of London,"Collins, M (通讯作者)，Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",marissa.collins@gcu.ac.uk,"O'Flaherty, Martin/JXM-0484-2024; Shao, Ruitai/AAU-7642-2021","Guzman-Castillo, Maria/0000-0002-1220-9472; O'Flaherty, Martin/0000-0001-8944-4131; Mason, Helen/0000-0002-9303-2794; Critchley, Julia/0000-0002-5248-4188; Collins, Marissa/0000-0002-0896-6673",Medical Research Council NPRI3 programme [G0900847/1]; Medical Research Council [G0900847] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0900847] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council NPRI3 programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the Medical Research Council NPRI3 programme under grant agreement G0900847/1-Prevention IMPACT: developing and evaluating economic models for planning optimal cardiovascular prevention strategies.

If the regressor and error term share the same index of stability alpha < 2, we show that the R-2 statistic does not converge to a constant but has a nondegenerate distribution on the entire [0, 1] interval. We provide closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function and probability density function of this limit random variable, and we show that the density function is unbounded at 0 and 1. If the indices of stability of the regressor and error term are unequal, we show that the coefficient of determination converges in probability to either 0 or 1, depending on which variable has the smaller index of stability, irrespective of the value of the slope coefficient. In an empirical application, we revisit the Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-stage regression and demonstrate that in the infinite-variance case the R-2 statistic of the second-stage regression converges to 0 in probability even if the slope coefficient is nonzero. We deduce that a small value of the R-2 statistic should not, in itself, be used to reject the usefulness of a regression model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the discretely-sampled realized variance can be robustly replicated under very general conditions, including when the price can jump. The replication strategy specifies the exact timing for rebalancing in the underlying. The deviations from the optimal schedule can lead to surprisingly large hedging errors. In the empirical application, we synthesize the prices of the variance contract on S&P 500 index over the period from 01/1990 to 12/2009. We find that the market variance risk is priced, its risk premium is negative and economically very large. The variance risk premium cannot be explained by the known risk factors and option returns.

Yet, this assumption may be restrictive unless parameter shifts are mild (i.e., local to zero). In this paper we develop a new testing procedure to detect big breaks in these loadings at either known or unknown dates. It relies upon testing for parameter breaks in a regression of one of the factors estimated by Principal Components analysis on the remaining estimated factors, where the number of factors is chosen according to Bai and Ng's (2002) information criteria. The test fares well in terms of power relative to other recently proposed tests on this issue, and can be easily implemented to avoid forecasting failures in standard factor-augmented (FAR, FAVAR) models where the number of factors is a priori imposed on the basis of theoretical considerations.

J,"Lang, JC; De Sterck, H",,,,"Lang, J. C.; De Sterck, H.",,,The Arab Spring: A simple compartmental model for the dynamics of a revolution,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"We introduce a simple compartmental model for the dynamics of a revolution in dictatorial regimes that employ censorship and police repression. A defining property of the model is the use of visibility and policing terms that feature rapid transitions as a function of the size of the revolution, for which we provide conceptual and network-based mathematical justifications. The complete mathematical classification of the dynamical behaviour of the model leads to a division in parameter space that is interpreted naturally in terms of stability of the regime (stable police state, meta-stable police state, unstable police state, and failed state). We show that these dynamical properties of the model are generic for a broad class of visibility and policing functions that feature rapid transitions. We investigate how the model can be applied to the peaceful revolutions of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt, taking into account the influence of the Internet and new media on the visibility of the revolution and the ensuing reduced effectivity of censorship. Within the model this leads to significant, discontinuous changes in regime stability, which greatly increase the probability of realized revolutions. These properties of the model inform possible answers to questions on causes and timing of the Arab Spring revolutions, and the role of the Internet and new media. The broader relevance of the model classification is also investigated by applying it to the current political situation in some other countries with regimes that employ censorship and police repression.

Health economists and their health technology assessment colleagues have become obsessed by technology adoption questions and have largely ignored 'technology management' questions. Technology management would include the life-cycle assessment of technologies in use, to assess their real-world performance; and monitoring of technology indication creep. A rebalancing of focus might serve to encourage a more self-critical and learning culture amongst those involved in technology evaluation analysis. Further, health economists and health technology assessment analysts could make a more significant contribution to system efficiency through rebalancing their efforts away from technology adoption questions towards technology management issues.

We consider the implications of increased information from genetic tests about predisposition to diseases from the perspective of managing health care provision under a public health insurance scheme. In particular, we consider how such information may potentially improve the targeting of medical surveillance (or prevention) activities to improve the chances of early detection of disease onset. We show that the moral hazard implications inherent in surveillance and prevention decisions that are chosen to be privately rather than socially optimal may be exacerbated by increased information about person-specific predisposition to disease.

This study applies a pseudo-panel approach to the cross-sectional Living Cost and Food Survey 2001/2-2009 to estimate the own- and cross-price elasticities of off- and on-trade beer, cider, wine, spirits and ready-to-drinks in the UK. A pseudo-panel with 72 subgroups defined by birth year, gender and socioeconomic status is constructed. Estimated own-price elasticities from the base case fixed effect models are all negative and mostly statically significant (p<0.05). Off-trade cider and beer are most elastic (-1.27 and -0.98) and off-trade spirits and on-trade ready-to-drinks are least elastic (-0.08 and -0.19).

Because ADHD has become one of the most prevalent childhood mental conditions, it is useful to understand the full set of consequences of the illness. This article uses a longitudinal national sample, including sibling pairs, to show the important labor market outcome consequences of ADHD. The employment reduction is between 10 and 14 percentage points, the earnings reduction is approximately 33%, and the increase in social assistance is 15 points, figures that are larger than many estimates of the Black people/White people earnings gap and the gender earnings gap. A small share of the link is explained by educational attainments and co-morbid health conditions and behaviors. The results also show important differences in labor market consequences by family background and age of onset. These findings, along with similar research showing that ADHD is linked with poor education outcomes and adult crime, suggest the importance of treating childhood ADHD to foster human capital.

We show, under specific assumptions on the value distributions of the bidders, that in large markets the multi-unit format generates higher (lower) expected revenue compared to the bundled format when the supply is relatively scarce (abundant). In contrast, a large market is shown to be always more efficient under the multi-unit format than its bundled counterpart. Thus under these assumptions a profit maximizing seller is expected to choose the relatively efficient multi-unit format when supply is scarce. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The need for simulation or bootstrap to obtain test critical values is thereby obviated. A simple procedure is enabled using fixed critical values. The test is shown to have correct asymptotic size in the uniform sense that supremum finite-sample rejection probability over null-restricted data distributions tends asymptotically to nominal significance level. This applies under weak assumptions allowing for estimator covariance singularity. The test is unbiased for a wide class of local alternatives. A new theorem establishes directions in which the test is locally most powerful. The proposed procedure is compared with predominant existing tests in structure, theory and simulation.

The final bargaining outcome in fee licensing is uniquely determined, because the bargaining set for a coalition structure in which the patent holder can gain the maximum profit is a singleton. Under the royalty policy, the non-empty core for a coalition structure suggests that the patent holder should license his patented technology to all firms. Moreover, royalty licensing may be superior to fee licensing for the patent holder, when licensing is carried out through bargaining. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Wade; Births,LIBERALIZED ABORTION; IMPACT; PROVIDERS; RATES,"We use unique data on abortions performed in New York State from 1971 to 1975 to demonstrate that women traveled hundreds of miles for a legal abortion before Roe. A 100-mile increase in distance for women who live approximately 183 miles from New York was associated with a decline in abortion rates of 12.2 percent whereas the same change for women who lived 830 miles from New York lowered abortion rates by 3.3 percent. The abortion rates of nonwhites were more sensitive to distance than those of whites. We found a positive and robust association between distance to the nearest abortion provider and teen birth rates but less consistent estimates for other ages. Our results suggest that even if some states lost all abortion providers due to legislative policies, the impact on population measures of birth and abortion rates would be small as most women would travel to states with abortion services.

The definition implies that if Omega = 2(N), then the game (N, v, Omega) = (N, v) is the classical transferable utility (TU) cooperative game. The class of all games with restricted cooperation g(r) with an arbitrary universal set of players is considered. The prenucleolus and the prekernel for games with restricted cooperation are defined in the same way as the prenucleolus and the prekernel for classical TU games. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the collection Omega to imply the single-valuedness of the prenucleolus are obtained. Axiomatic characterizations of the prenucleolus and of the prekernel for the class g(b)(r) with a balanced collection of feasible coalitions Omega are given. In the collection Omega there may be identical players belonging to the same coalitions. In that case, the set of symmetric preimputations is defined as those where identical players have equal payoffs. The symmetric prenucleolus, being the nucleolus w.r.t. the set of symmetrical preimputations, is defined and characterized.

The lack of random assignment to treatment in real-world clinical settings leads to selection-bias issues when evaluating the marginal benefits of treatment. The application of instrumental variables (IV) estimation to mitigate selection bias has traditionally been limited to comparing only two treatments/interventions concurrently. Using the case of biologic treatment in rheumatoid arthritis, we describe a generalized method of moments (GMM)-based panel data IV (IV-GMM) framework, to simultaneously estimate multiple treatment effects in the presence of time-varying selection bias and time-invariant heterogeneity. To satisfy the order and rank conditions for identification with multiple endogeneity, we propose lagged values of each treatment as excluded instruments. We evaluate the validity of the IV estimation assumptions on instrument relevance and exogeneity. Results indicate that the IV-GMM model offers enhanced control over selection bias and heterogeneity, and more importantly the panel data framework can provide valid excluded instruments that satisfy the order and rank conditions for identification when dealing with multiple endogenous variables. The approach outlined in this article has broad application for comparative effectiveness and health technology assessment involving multiple treatments/interventions using real-world nonexperimental data.

Method: Patients were randomly selected from a multicenter clinical study to participate in the discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey. Relevant treatment attributes were identified through literature review, clinical expert consultation, and focus groups. The DCE included 14 choice tasks composed of six attributes, three treatment profiles, and a noneoption considering orthogonality, D-efficiency, and level balance, while keeping patient response burden reasonable. Individual-level preferences and WTP were estimated by aggregate-level conditional logit and hierarchical Bayes analyses. Results: Our sample of 361, drawn from a clinical trial, had a mean age of 57 years, were primarily women (53%), and rated their GERD symptoms as mild/moderate (31%) and moderately severe/severe (7%). Most important attributes of GERD treatment were (in order) as follows: avoiding side effects, sleeping discomfort, daytime discomfort, dietary changes, medication cost, and treatment frequency. Simulations found that patients are willing to pay an additional US $36 to reduce susceptibility to side effects from moderate to mild or to decrease the frequency of sleeping discomfort. Patients 65 years or older were willing to pay less for daytime discomfort relief, while women would pay more to avoid sleeping discomfort. Conclusions: Key factors concerning patients with GERD and their preference for treatment features to control GERD symptoms were confirmed. A DCE estimated WTP by GERD sufferers for relief from symptoms and avoidance of side effects using relevant treatment costs. These findings may help guide clinical treatment decisions for individual patients to improve GERD symptom control.","[Deal, Ken; Moayyedi, Paul] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Marshall, Deborah] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Marshall, Deborah; Dabrowski, Dominika] OptumInsight, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Charter, Alina; Bukoski, Margaret] AstraZeneca Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada",McMaster University; University of Calgary; Optum; AstraZeneca,"Dabrowski, D (通讯作者)，5500 North Serv Rd,Suite 501, Burlington, ON L7L 6W6, Canada.",dominika.dabrowski@optum.com,"Moayyedi, Paul/M-6178-2014; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Moayyedi, Paul/0000-0002-3616-9292; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008",AstraZeneca Canada,AstraZeneca Canada(AstraZeneca),This work was supported by AstraZeneca Canada.,,54,7,8,1,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,588,598,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.01.007,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796293.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900018,0

This paper describes a novel methodologyrisk adjusted cost-effectiveness (RAC-E)that facilitates the comparative evaluation of applied clinical practice processes. In this application, risk adjustment is undertaken with a multivariate matching algorithm that balances the baseline characteristics of patients attending different settings (e.g. hospitals). Linked, routinely collected data are used to analyse patient-level costs and outcomes over a 2-year period, as well as to extrapolate costs and survival over patient lifetimes. The study reports the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of clinical practice, including a full representation of the statistical uncertainty around the mean estimates. The methodology is illustrated by a case study that evaluates the relative cost-effectiveness of services for patients presenting with acute chest pain across the four main public hospitals in South Australia. The evaluation finds that services provided at two hospitals were dominated, and of the remaining services, the more effective hospital gained life years at a low mean additional cost and had an 80% probability of being the most cost-effective hospital at realistic cost-effectiveness thresholds. Potential determinants of the estimated variation in costs and effects were identified, although more detailed analyses to identify specific areas of variation in clinical practice are required to inform improvements at the less cost-effective institutions.

The first mission of the group was to develop a checklist focused on issues specific to selection of a sample of oncology patients using a secondary data source. Methods: A systematic review of the published literature from 2006 to 2010 was conducted to characterize the use of secondary data sources in oncology and inform the leadership of the working group prior to the construction of the checklist. A draft checklist was subsequently presented to the ISPOR membership in 2011 with subsequent feedback from the larger Oncology Special Interest Group also incorporated into the final checklist. Results: The checklist includes six elements: identification of the cancer to be studied, selection of an appropriate data source, evaluation of the applicability of published algorithms, development of custom algorithms (if needed), validation of the custom algorithm, and reporting and discussions of the ascertainment criteria. The checklist was intended to be applicable to various types of secondary data sources, including cancer registries, claims databases, electronic medical records, and others. Conclusions: This checklist makes two important contributions to oncology health services research. First, it can assist decision makers and reviewers in evaluating the quality of studies using secondary data. Second, it highlights methodological issues to be considered when researchers are constructing a study cohort from a secondary data source.","[Schulman, Kathy L.] Outcomes Res Solut Inc, Bolton, MA 01740 USA; [Berenson, Karina] Covance, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Shih, Ya-Chen (Tina); de Souza, Jonas; Yaghmour, Nicholas A.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Foley, Kathleen A.] Truven Hlth Analyt, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Ganguli, Arijit] Abbott Labs, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA; [Shteynshlyuger, Alex] Phoenixville Urol Associates, Phoenixville, PA USA",Covance; University of Chicago; Abbott Laboratories,"Schulman, KL (通讯作者)，Outcomes Res Solut Inc, 44 Whitcomb Rd, Bolton, MA 01740 USA.",kathy.schulman@orsolutionsinc.com,,"Shih, Ya-Chen Tina/0000-0001-7290-3864",,,,,321,22,22,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,655,669,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.006,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796301.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900026,0

This research investigates (i) the values generated from different combinations of time in poor health and in full health; and the order in which these appear (lead vs. lag); (ii) whether values concur with participants' views about states; (iii) methods for handling extreme preferences. n=208 participants valued five EQ-5D states, using two of four variants. Combinations of lead time and health state duration were: 10 years and 20 years; 5 years and 1 year; 5 years and 10 years; and a health state duration of 5 years with a lag time of 10 years. Longer lead times capture more preferences, but may involve a framing effect. Lag time results in less non-trading for mild states, and less time being traded for severe states. Negative values broadly agree with participants' stated opinion that the state is worse than dead. The values are sensitive to the ratio of lead time to duration of poor health, and the order in which these appear (lead vs. lag). It is feasible to handle extreme preferences though challenges remain.

This letter estimates the human cost of the 20082009 global financial crisis in one critical dimensioninfant mortalityfor countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis pools birth-level data, as reported in female adult retrospective birth histories from all Demographic and Health Surveys collected in sub-Saharan Africa. This results in a data set of 639,000 births to 264,000 women in 30 countries. We use regression models with flexible controls for temporal trends to assess an infant's likelihood of death as a function of fluctuations in national income. We then calculate the expected number of excess deaths by combining these estimates with growth shortfalls as a result of the crisis. The results suggest 28,00050,000 excess infant deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in the crisis-affected year of 2009. Notably, most of these additional deaths were concentrated among girls. Policies that protect the income of poor households and that maintain critical health services during times of economic contraction may reduce the expected increase in mortality. Interventions targeted at female infants and young girls can be particularly beneficial.

An investigation into public-private sector differences in England,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Patient experience; Public-private sector differences; Hospital ownership; National Health Service; UK,QUALITY-OF-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; SATISFACTION; INCENTIVES; MOTIVATIONS; BEHAVIOR,"Using patient experience survey data, the paper investigates whether hospital ownership affects the level of quality reported by patients whose care is funded by the National Health Service in areas other than clinical quality. We estimate a switching regression model that accounts for (i) some observable characteristics of the patient and the hospital episode; (ii) selection into private hospitals; and (iii) unmeasured hospital characteristics captured by hospital fixed effects. We find that the experience reported by patients in public and private hospitals is different, i.e. most dimensions of quality are delivered differently by the two types of hospitals, with each sector offering greater quality in certain specialties or to certain groups of patients. However, the sum of all ownership effects is not statistically different from zero at sample means. In other words, hospital ownership in and of itself does not affect the level of quality of the average patient's reported experience. Differences in mean reported quality levels between the private and public sectors are entirely attributable to patient characteristics, the selection of patients into public or private hospitals and unobserved characteristics specific to individual hospitals, rather than to hospital ownership.

It differs from most empirical studies as subjects were not asked about their personal preferences for programmes per se. Rather, they were asked about the principles that should guide the choice of programmes. Four different principles were framed as arguments for alternative programmes. The results from population surveys in Australia and Norway suggest that people are least supportive of the principle that decision makers should follow the stated preferences of the public. Rather, respondents expressed more support for decisions based upon health maximisation, equality and urgency.

First, we extend the concepts of structural stability and robustness to epsilon-equilibria that is defined in Anderlini and Canning (2001), Yu and Yu (2006) and Yu et al. (2009) so that we investigate whether the introduction of a small amount of additional rationality into a model has little impact on the set of bounded rational equilibria. In this paper, we call a model (lambda, epsilon)-robust if small deviations of rationality in a bounded rational environment result in only small changes in the set of boundedly rational equilibria. We also say that a model is (lambda, epsilon)-stable if given bounded rational agents, the set of the bounded rational equilibria varies continuously with the pair of the parameter value and the degree of rationality in the model. Secondly, we discuss the relationship between (lambda, epsilon)-stability and essential equilibria. A boundedly rational equilibrium action is said to be essential at some parameter value and some degree of rationality if each action nearby is also a boundedly rational equilibrium behavior at nearby parameter values and degrees of rationality, i.e. the essentiality is a kind of stability property of the set of boundedly rational equilibria against slight perturbations of the parameter value and the degree of rationality. Our main results are as follows: (1)(lambda, epsilon)-stability implies (lambda, epsilon)-robustness of the model, and as a corollary, (lambda, epsilon)-robustness for almost all pairs of the parameter value and the degree of rationality is established, (2) under some mild conditions, a model is (lambda, epsilon)-stable if and only if any element of the set of bounded rational equilibria is essential.

However, investigation of this hypothesis is complicated by a variety of empirical challenges, including difficulties in inferring causation due to omitted variables and reverse causation. For example, to compare two groups with substantially different mortality rates, one typically has to use samples from different countries or periods, making it difficult to control for other relevant variables. Reverse causation is important because human capital investment can affect mortality and morbidity. To counter these problems, we collected data on human capital investments, fertility decisions, and other economic choices of people at risk for Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a fatal genetic disorder that introduces a large and exogenous risk of early mortality and morbidity. We find a strong negative relation between mortality and morbidity risks and human capital investment.

In its standard characterization, the null player property indicates the absence of solidarity among the players. First, we replace the null player property by a new axiom that guarantees null players non-negative payoffs whenever the grand coalition's worth is non-negative. Second, the equal treatment property is strengthened into desirability. This way, we obtain a new characterization of the class of egalitarian Shapley values, i.e., of convex combinations of the Shapley value and the equal division solution. Within this characterization, additivity and desirability can be replaced by strong differential monotonicity, which translates higher productivity differentials into higher payoff differentials.

While these methods span a variety of techniques, conjoint-analysis methods and particularly discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) have become the most frequently applied approach in health care in recent years. Experimental design is an important stage in the development of such methods, but establishing a consensus on standards is hampered by lack of understanding of available techniques and software. This report builds on the previous ISPOR Conjoint Analysis Task Force Report: Conjoint Analysis Applications in Health A Checklist: A Report of the ISPOR Good Research Practices for Conjoint Analysis Task Force. This report aims to assist researchers specifically in evaluating alternative approaches to experimental design, a difficult and important element of successful DCEs. While this report does not endorse any specific approach, it does provide a guide for choosing an approach that is appropriate for a particular study. In particular, it provides an overview of the role of experimental designs for the successful implementation of the DCE approach in health care studies, and it provides researchers with an introduction to constructing experimental designs on the basis of study objectives and the statistical model researchers have selected for the study. The report outlines the theoretical requirements for designs that identify choice-model preference parameters and summarizes and compares a number of available approaches for constructing experimental designs. The task-force leadership group met via bimonthly teleconferences and in person at ISPOR meetings in the United States and Europe. An international group of experimental-design experts was consulted during this process to discuss existing approaches for experimental design and to review the task force's draft reports. In addition, ISPOR members contributed to developing a consensus report by submitting written comments during the review process and oral comments during two forum presentations at the ISPOR 16th and 17th Annual International Meetings held in Baltimore (2011) and Washington, DC (2012).","[Johnson, F.

Most discussions in the literature address these problems independently, yet a joint treatment is essential. We present a new framework that makes such a joint treatment possible, using flexible nonlinear models specified by Gaussian process priors and addressing the variable selection problem by means of Bayesian model averaging. Using this framework, we extend the linear model to allow for parameter heterogeneity of the type suggested by new growth theory, while taking into account the uncertainty in selecting explanatory variables. Controlling for variable selection uncertainty, we confirm the evidence in favor of parameter heterogeneity presented in several earlier studies. However, controlling for functional form uncertainty, we find that the effects of many of the explanatory variables identified in the literature are not robust across countries and variable selections.

A pooled semiparametric profile likelihood dummy variable approach based on the first-stage local linear fitting is developed to estimate both the parameter vector and the nonlinear time trend function. As both the time series length T and the cross-sectional size N tend to infinity, the resulting estimator of the parameter vector is asymptotically normal with a root-(NT) convergence rate. Meanwhile, the asymptotic distribution for the nonparametric estimator of the trend function is also established with a root-(NTh) convergence rate. Two simulated examples are provided to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method. In addition, the proposed model and estimation method are applied to a CPI data set as well as an input-output data set. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We adopt a generalized-method-of moments perspective in a possibly non-linear econometric specification. If, after attempting to replicate the structural relation, we find substantial evidence against the overidentifying restrictions of an augmented model, this is evidence against underidentification of the original model. To diagnose how identification might fail, we study the estimation of a one-dimensional curve that gives the parameter configurations that provide the greatest challenge to identification, and we illustrate this calculation in an empirical example.

We prove their asymptotic equivalence to existing tests under local alternatives. We also show that unlike two-step or iterated procedures, single-step methods such as continuously updated GMM yield numerically identical overidentifying restrictions test, so there is arguably a single spanning test. To prove these results, we extend optimal GMM inference to deal with singularities in the long run second moment matrix of the influence functions.

We formally establish sufficient conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the quantile regression estimator when the number of individuals, n, and the number of time periods, T, jointly go to infinity. The estimator is shown to be consistent under similar conditions to those found in the nonlinear panel data literature. Nevertheless, due to the non-smoothness of the objective function, we had to impose a more restrictive condition on T to prove asymptotic normality than that usually found in the literature. The finite sample performance of the estimator is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This type of assessment is often referred to as a relative effectiveness assessment (REA) and is carried out by many jurisdictions. Increased sharing of information across jurisdictions may save costs and reduce duplication. The objective of this study was to explore the main similarities and differences in the major methodological aspects of REA in multiple jurisdictions. Methods: Data were gathered with a standardized data extraction form by searching publicly available information and by eliciting information from representatives at relevant organizations. Results: Of the initially included 35 jurisdictions, data were gathered for 29 jurisdictions. There seem to be substantial similarities on the choice of the comparator, the role of indirect comparisons, and preferred end points in REAs (except for the use of health state utilities). Jurisdictions, however, differ in whether effectiveness (usual circumstances of health care practice) is estimated in case no (comparative) effectiveness data are available and how this is done. Conclusion: Some important methodological aspects for REA are approached in a similar way in many jurisdictions, indicating that collaboration on assessments may be feasible. Enhanced collaboration in the development of methods and best practices for REA between jurisdictions will be a necessary first step. Important topics for developing best practice are indirect comparisons and how to handle the gap between efficacy and effectiveness data in case good quality comparative effectiveness data are not yet available at the time of reimbursement decisions.","[Kleijnen, Sarah; Goettsch, Wim G.] Coll Zorgverzekeringen, NL-3508 TB Diemen, Netherlands; [Kleijnen, Sarah; Leufkens, Hubert G.; de Boer, Anthonius; Goettsch, Wim G.] Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Clin Pharmacol, Fac Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [George, Elisabeth; Goulden, Scott] Natl Inst Hlth & Clin Excellence, London, England; [d'Andon, Anne; Vitre, Pauline] Haute Autorite Sante, Paris, France; [Osinska, Boguslawa; Rdzany, Rafal] Agcy Hlth Technol Assessment, Warsaw, Poland; [Thirstrup, Steffen] Inst Rat Pharmacotherapy, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Corbacho, Belen] Andalusian HTA Agcy, Seville, Spain; [Nagy, Bence Z.] Hungarian Natl Inst Qual & Org Dev, Budapest, Hungary",Utrecht University; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Kleijnen, S (通讯作者)，Coll Zorgverzekeringen, POB 80082, NL-3508 TB Diemen, Netherlands.",skleijnen@cvz.nl,"Thirstrup, Steffen/JGD-9024-2023","Thirstrup, Steffen/0000-0003-0903-682X",European Union; European Commission,European Union(European Union (EU)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Source of financial support: This work was produced by EUnetHTA Joint Action, which has received funding from the European Union.

We find that European DRG systems use very different types of classification variables and numbers of DRGs (range: 37) to classify these patients. In 6 of 10 countries, the set of patient characteristics, treatment and quality variables, which we were able to define across countries, perform better than the set of national DRGs in accounting for patient-level variation in resource consumption. Moreover, there appear to be factors that are consistently significant determinants of cost/length of stay of breast cancer surgery cases but are not, or at least not fully, considered in European DRG systems. Our results therefore raise concerns as to whether all systems rely on the most appropriate classification variables. In several countries, policymakers should reevaluate the appropriateness of their DRG algorithm for breast cancer surgery and of specific DRG weights.

Our analysis draws on longitudinal hospitalization records coupled with a settlement policy where Swedish authorities assigned newly arrived refugees to their first area of residence. The policy was implemented in a way that provides a source of plausibly random variation in initial location. The results reveal no statistically significant effect of income inequality on the risk of being hospitalized. This finding holds also for most population subgroups and when separating between different types of diagnoses. Our estimates are precise enough to rule out large effects of income inequality on health. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We exploit a randomized intervention that increased schooling (and reduced working) among male students in the Dominican Republic, by providing information on the returns to schooling. We find that treated youths were much less likely to smoke at age 18 and had delayed onset of daily or regular drinking. The effects appear to be due to changes in peer networks and disposable income. We find no evidence of a direct impact of schooling on rates of time preference, attitudes towards risk or perceptions that drinking or smoking are harmful to health, though our measures of these factors are more limited.

This dichotomy enables us to separate providers' selection of patients from patients' selection of providers. Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we estimate a nonlinear difference-in-differences model and derive asymptotic standard errors. The mortality rate for bypass patient decreases by only 0.05 percentage points because of the report cards, which we interpret as evidence that quality of bypass surgery did not improve (at least in the short-term) nor did patient selection by providers occur. Our timing, estimation, and asymptotics are readily applicable to many other report card schemes.

We use quantile regression to provide a broad description of the relationship across the wage distribution. We also allow the relationship to vary by the degree of social skills involved in different jobs. Our results find that for female workers body mass and wages are negatively correlated at all points in their wage distribution. The strength of the relationship is larger at higher-wage levels. For male workers, the relationship is relatively constant across wage distribution but heterogeneous across ethnic groups. When controlling for the endogeneity of body mass, we find that additional body mass has a negative causal impact on the wages of white females earning more than the median wages and of white males around the median wages. Among these workers, the wage penalties are larger for those employed in jobs that require extensive social skills. These findings may suggest that labor markets reward white workers for good physical shape differently, depending on the level of wages and the type of job a worker has.

In another model (Samuelson, 1985; Li and Zheng, 2009), bidders are assumed to learn their values before their entry decisions are made. The entry cost in the latter model can be interpreted as bid preparation cost, while the entry cost in the former model consists of both costs from information acquisition and bid preparation. Moreover, these two models have different implications for important policies, e.g., the optimal reserve price. In this paper we provide a unified structural framework where the two models can be estimated and distinguished using the Bayesian method.

We concentrate on the effects of travel time and waiting time and especially on estimating the waiting time elasticity of demand. Models including hospital fixed effects rely on changes over time in waiting time to indentify coefficients. We show how using a latent-class multinomial logit model characterises the unobserved heterogeneity in GP practices' choice behaviour and affects the estimated elasticities of travel time and waiting time. The models estimate waiting time elasticities of demand of approximately -0.1, comparable with previous waiting time-demand models. For the average waiting time elasticity, the simple multinomial logit models are good approximations of the latent-class logit results.

This paper shows that one of the two assumptions used in BIA studies to date will necessarily produce a more pro-rich (or less pro-poor) picture of government health spending than the other, depending on whether utilization is more pro-rich or pro-poor than fees paid to public providers. Both assumptions have their disadvantages, and the paper suggests a couple of alternatives that explicitly link fees paid to the costliness of care. It shows that in the most likely case where fees are distributed in a more pro-rich fashion than utilization, the two traditional assumptions will produce less pro-rich distributions of subsidies than the two new alternatives. Also considered are three complications that arise in BIA studies, including factoring in social health insurance. The paper's theoretical results are illustrated with an empirical BIA for Vietnam.

Individuals vary in income and severity of illness. There is a limited supply of health-care resources used to treat individuals, causing some individuals to go untreated. Insurers (both public and private) must bid to obtain the necessary health-care resources to treat their beneficiaries. Given individuals' willingnesses-to-pay for private insurance are increasing in income, the introduction of private insurance diverts treatment from relatively poor to relatively rich individuals. Further, the impact of introducing parallel private insurance depends on the rationing mechanism in the public sector.

Evidence from rural China,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; Health outcome; Educational outcome; China,CARE; ELIGIBILITY; IMPACT,"Using the 2006 China Agricultural Census (CAC), we examine whether the introduction of the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) has affected child mortality, maternal mortality, and school enrollment of 6-16 year olds. Our data cover 5.9 million people living in eight low-income rural counties, of which four adopted the NCMS by 2006 and four did not adopt it until 2007. Raw data suggest that enrolling in the NCMS is associated with better school enrollment and lower mortality of young children and pregnant women. However, using a difference-in-difference propensity score method, we find that most of the differences are driven by endogenous introduction and take-up of the NCMS, and our method overcomes classical propensity score matching's failure to address selection bias. While the NCMS does not affect child morality and maternal mortality, it does help improve the school enrollment of six-year-olds. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As the latter behaviour is often attributed to the social pressure to be thin, some governments have already taken actions to ban ultra-thin ideals and models. This paper proposes a theoretical framework to assess whether increasing the ideal body weight is socially desirable, both from a welfare and a health point of view. We first show that being underweight and being overweight are possible outcomes of a rational eating model. Then, assuming that people are heterogeneous in their healthy weights but exposed to the same ideal body weight, we show that increasing the thin ideal weight can be welfare improving, but may exacerbate the obesity epidemic.

Methods: Decision analytic models were constructed, using a societal perspective, to assess the cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from systematic screening using the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry alone compared with no screening. Alendronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and nasal calcitonin were economically evaluated to determine a treatment of choice for the prevention of osteoporosis-related fractures. Most input parameters were obtained from literature reviews, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses, if available. The service costs and related household expenses were based on the Thai setting. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were used to incorporate the impact of parameter uncertainty. Results: The Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool and sequential dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry provided better value for money for osteoporosis screening among young age groups (<60 years old). Although there was no significant difference in cost per QALY for older age groups, alendronate provided the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio while nasal calcitonin presented the highest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. It was shown that providing medication for a secondary prevention yielded a much higher cost per QALY gained compared with providing medication for a primary prevention. Conclusions: Given the benchmark set at 100,000 Thai baht per QALY gained, providing systematic screening and treatment for osteoporosis was cost-ineffective in the Thai setting.","[Kingkaew, Pritaporn] Minist Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand; [Maleewong, Usawadee] Mahasarakham Univ, Fac Pharm, Maha Sarakham, Thailand; [Ngarmukos, Chardpraorn] Mahidol Univ, Ramathibodi Hosp, Fac Med, Bangkok 10400, Thailand",Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; Mahasarakham University; Mahidol University,"Kingkaew, P (通讯作者)，Minist Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, 6th Floor,6th Bldg,Tiwanon Rd, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand.",pritaporn.k@hitap.net,,"Teerawattananon, Yot/0000-0003-2217-2930; Kingkaew, Pritaporn/0000-0003-2626-7806","Thai Health Promotion Foundation; Health System Research Institute; Bureau of Policy and Strategy, the Ministry of Public Health","Thai Health Promotion Foundation; Health System Research Institute; Bureau of Policy and Strategy, the Ministry of Public Health","This study was jointly funded by grants from the Thai Health Promotion Foundation, the Health System Research Institute, and the Bureau of Policy and Strategy, the Ministry of Public Health.",,34,9,12,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S20,S28,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.015,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265062.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000005,0

J,"Nagata, R",,,,"Nagata, Ryo",,,Organizational dynamics with symmetric responses of members,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMICS,"In this paper, we consider the dynamics of an organization whose members share a sense of camaraderie. More specifically, the organization to be considered is formed when people who share a specific sense of purpose spontaneously gather and cooperate with one another to engage in a specific social activity. We describe the state of such organizations with an index derived from a principle of each member. We can then trace the evolution of an organization by examining the behavior of the index. We consider the behavior of the index to be determined through two channels: (1) the principle response among members and (2) the relation between a member's principle and the social environment. We analyze the evolution of the organization by using a dynamical system with a particular focus on how an organization changes in response to changes in the social environment. Using the bifurcation theory, we obtain a result where an organization with a symmetric response of members' principles eventually either splits into two parties or maintains unity but with a different index. In addition, we propose a process for the reaction of an organization to changes in the social environment and show that the type of initially formed symmetric response determines the final state of the organization.

In Thailand, cervical cancer has been the leading cancer in females, with an incidence of 24.7 cases per 100,000 individuals per year. Objectives: We constructed a decision model to simulate the lifetime economic impact for women in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection prevention. HPV-related diseases were of interest: cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and genital warts. The two strategies used were 1) current practice and 2) prophylactic quadrivalent vaccine against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Methods: We developed a Markov simulation model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of prophylactic HPV vaccine. Women transition through a model either healthy or developing HPV or its related diseases, or die from cervical cancer or from other causes according to transitional probabilities under the Thai health-care con-text. Costs from a provider perspective were obtained from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Results: Compared with no prophylactic HPV vaccine, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 160,649.50 baht per quality-adjusted life-year. The mortality rate was reduced by 54.8%. The incidence of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3, and genital warts was reduced by up to 55.1%. Conclusion: Compared with commonly accepted standard thresholds recommended by the World Health Organization Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, the nationwide coverage of HPV vaccination in girls is likely to be cost-effective in Thailand.","[Havanond, Piyalamporn; Lertmaharit, Somrat; Pongpanich, Sathirakorn; Taneepanichskul, Surasak] Chulalongkorn Univ, Coll Publ Hlth Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Termrungruanglert, Wichai; Khemapech, Nipon; Lertmaharit, Somrat; Khorprasert, Chonlakiet; Taneepanichskul, Surasak] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Med, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Chulalongkorn University,"Havanond, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Coll Publ Hlth Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",piyalamporn.h@chula.ac.th,"Termrungruanglert, Wichai/AAR-6406-2020","Termrungruanglert, Wichai/0000-0003-3510-0047; Khorprasert, Chonlakiet/0000-0002-6889-3832",MSD (Thailand),MSD (Thailand),A grant for this study was provided by MSD (Thailand).

Methods: The EVIC quantifies how much benefits are forgone when a treatment decision is based on the best-expected outcomes in the population rather than in the individual patient. We have reviewed which types of patient-level attributes contribute to the EVIC and how they affect the interpretation of the outcomes. In addition, we have applied the EVIC framework to the outcomes of a microsimulation-based cost-effectiveness analysis for glaucoma treatment. Results: For EVIC outcomes to inform decisions about clinical practice, we need to calculate the parameter-specific EVIC of known or knowable patient-level attributes and compare it with the real costs of implementing individualized care. In the case study, the total EVIC was (sic)580 per patient, but patient-level attributes known at treatment decision had minimal impact. A subgroup policy based on individual disease progression could be worthwhile if a predictive test for glaucoma progression could be developed and implemented for less than (sic)130 per patient. Conclusions: The EVIC framework is feasible in cost-effectiveness analyses and can be informative for decision making. The EVIC outcomes are particularly informative when they are (close to) zero. When the EVIC has a high value, implications depend on the type of patient-level attribute. EVIC can be a useful tool to identify opportunities to improve efficiency in health care by individualization of care and to quantify the maximal investment opportunities for implementing subgroup policy.","[Severens, Johan] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Gestel, Aukje; Schouten, Jan; Webers, Carroll; Beckers, Henny] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Univ Eye Clin, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Joore, Manuela] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Grutters, Janneke P.

Securitization is often suspected of being one of the main reasons for the recent financial crisis. One concern is that securitization leads to moral hazard in lender screening and monitoring. By selling loans to investors and removing them from their books, banks have a lesser incentive to carefully evaluate and monitor borrowers' credit quality to ensure that they can repay their loans. One problem in the literature is that the analysis of securitization is very general and suffers from a lack of specific security design analysis under asymmetric information. We address the moral hazard problem using a principal-agent model where the investor is the principal and the lender is the agent. We show that the optimal contract must contain a retention clause in the presence of moral hazard. The optimal retention is affected by tranching and credit enhancement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Data from the first wave of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement (SHARE) on formal (nursing care and paid domestic help) and informal care (support provided by relatives) are used to study the probability and the quantity of both types of care. The overall process is framed in a fully simultaneous equation system that takes the form of a bivariate two-part model where the reciprocal interaction between formal and informal care is estimated. Endogeneity and unobservable heterogeneity are addressed using a common latent factor approach. The analysis of the relative impact of age and disability on home care utilization is enriched by the use of a proximity to death (PtD) indicator built using the second wave of SHARE. All these indicators are important predictors of home care utilization. In particular, a strong significant effect of PtD is found in the paid domestic help and informal care models. The relationship between formal and informal care moves from substitutability to complementarity depending on the type of care considered, and the estimated effects are small in absolute size. This might call for a reconsideration of the effectiveness of incentives for informal care as instruments to reduce public expenditure for home care services.

Our objective is to assess the impact that changes in the technological intensity of physician-provided health services have had on the age pattern of both the volume of services provided and the average expenditures associated with them. We based our analysis on age-sex-specific patient-level administrative records of diagnoses and treatments. These records include virtually all physician services provided in the province of Ontario, Canada in a 10-year span ending in 2004 and their associated costs. An algorithm is developed to classify services and their costs into three levels of technological intensity. We find that while the overall age-standardized level and cost of services per capita have decreased, the volume and cost of high technologically intensive treatments have increased, especially among older patients.

The effectiveness of this policy depends critically on the long-run response of native nurses. We examine the effects of immigration of foreign-born registered nurses on the long-run employment and occupational choice of native nurses. Using a variety of empirical strategies that exploit the geographical distribution of immigrant nurses across US cities, we find evidence of large displacement effects over a ten-year period, for every foreign nurse that migrates to a city, between 1 and 2 fewer native nurses are employed in the city. We find similar results using data on nursing board exam-takers at the state level - an increase in the flow of foreign nurses significantly reduces the number of natives sitting for licensure exams in more dependent states relative to less dependent states. Using data on self-reported workplace satisfaction among a sample of California nurses, we find suggestive evidence that part of the displacement effects could be driven by a decline in the perceived quality of the workplace environment.

In particular, we investigate the impact of locus of control, self-esteem and work ethics at ages 15-16 years on the incidence of health behaviours such as alcohol consumption, cannabis and other drug use, unprotected and early sexual activity and sports and physical activity. We use matching methods to control for a very rich set of adolescent and family characteristics, and we find that personality traits do affect health behaviours. In particular, individuals with external locus of control, low self-esteem or with low levels of work ethics seem more likely in engage in risky health behaviours.
