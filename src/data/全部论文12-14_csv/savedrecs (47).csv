Our estimates for permanent and temporary minimum wage workers combined are at the lower end of estimates based on Canadian studies estimated over earlier time periods, suggesting that the adverse employment effects are declining over time for reasons discussed. Importantly, the adverse employment effects are substantially larger for permanent compared to temporary minimum wage workers; in fact they fall almost exclusively on permanent minimum wage workers.

We find that democratic governments are more likely to offer relatively lower tax rates to foreign investors, whereas autocratic governments are more likely to offer relatively lax regulation.

These are representative of ownership of listed firms by state, long term foreign partners, entrepreneurial founders, single family entities, extended family groups and business networks, domestic and foreign venture capitalists. An additional control for firms within business network controlled by former Tunisian premier, Ben Ali, and Morocco's royal family is also included. Using a unique sample of all listed firms across the equity markets of Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria I find evidence of equity capital rationing during the Arab Spring period of political upheaval. Less well regulated SME markets such as Morocco's marche croissance have liquidity-based transactions costs attributable to Arab Spring four times those of the marche principal while those in Egypt's Nilex are twenty times those of the prestigious EGX30 index. Finally the greatest changes in political risks associated with aggregate liquidity across the Arab Spring are democratic accountability, military in politics, and law and order.

J,"Johnson, WR",,,,"Johnson, William R.",,,House prices and female labor force participation,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Labor force participation; Housing prices,WOMEN; WAGES,"Is there a causal connection between house prices and labor force participation of married women? The simple correlation between house prices and married women's labor force participation across U.S. metro areas is positive. Plausible, informal arguments have been advanced to support causation in either direction: prices raising participation (negative income effects of higher house prices lead more married women to work) or participation raising prices (richer two-earner households bid up the price of scarce housing). I construct an equilibrium model of location, labor supply and real estate (land) prices within a metro area which predicts that (1) metro areas with exogenously less buildable land will have higher house prices and more labor force participation of married women, while (2) metro areas with married women exogenously more prone to work will have higher house prices. Using geographic instruments for housing supply, I find little evidence of a positive effect of house prices on married women's labor force participation, but a somewhat greater possibility that house prices raise their earnings. Likewise, an instrument for married women's labor supply reveals no consistent significant causal effect of two earner households on housing prices, although the possibility of a positive effect cannot be ruled out.

The current literature on portfolio optimization uses a somewhat naive approach, where portfolio weights are always completely revised after a predefined fixed period. However, one shortcoming of this procedure is that it ignores parameter uncertainty in the estimated portfolio weights, as well as the biasedness of the in-sample portfolio mean and variance as estimates of the expected portfolio return and out-of-sample variance. To rectify this problem, we propose a jackknife procedure to determine the optimal revision intensity, i.e. the percent of wealth that should be shifted to the new, in-sample optimal portfolio. We find that our approach leads to highly stable portfolio allocations over time, and can significantly reduce the turnover of several well established portfolio strategies. Moreover, the observed turnover reductions lead to statistically and economically significant performance gains in the presence of transaction costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze whether a reduced partisan influence is due to more trade openness, larger budget deficits or the creation of new supranational institutions. Our empirical approach distinguishes between the effects on the long-run growth of social expenditures and its short-run adjustment to violations of the long-run equilibrium linking social spending with macroeconomic and demographic trends. We find that partisan motives, indeed, play an important role in the explanation of short-run dynamics in social spending. Left-wing parties are found to spend significantly more than their right-wing counterparts and parties spend more before elections. However, the partisan influence has changed over time. While ideology has lost some of its influence, the electoral cycle has become more important to explain changes in social expenditure. This result should be addressed to a general institutional change that took place in the early 1990s and continued over that decade. While changes in trade openness, indebtedness and budget deficits have not changed the partisan influence on social spending, they are particularly important to explain the short-run dynamics of social spending.

Japan's total fertility rate has been declining since the 1970s and it fell below the replacement level of 1.3 in 2003. Since the 1990s, the Japanese government has implemented pro-natal policies such as childcare market deregulation, childcare center expansion in the Angel Plan and New Angel Plan, and provision of childbirth grants. However, these policies have failed to encourage childbirth. With rising labor force participation among Japanese women, the insufficiency of existing childcare center capacity to accommodate children of working mothers has resulted in the problem of wait-listed children. In addition, the failure of childcare centers to mitigate the conflict between women's work and child raising duties has discouraged women from child-bearing. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship and causality between childcare availability (CA), female labor force participation rate (LFPR) and fertility (TFR) in Japan for the period 1971-2009. A bounds test approach to cointegration establishes the existence of long-run equilibrium relations between CA, TFR and LFPR. Applying the Granger causality method, our results show the absence of Granger-causality running from childcare availability to fertility among females aged 30-39. In the long run, our results show that having more children at home does not discourage the female labor force participation. In addition, we find no evidence which suggests that working women tend to have fewer children. Overall, this study suggests the importance of the Japanese childcare system in supporting female employment. J. Japanese Int. Economies xxx (xx) (2014) xxx-xxx.

We show that a monetary policy response to the price of a productive tangible asset (capital price) is helpful for equilibrium determinacy, while that to the price of an intangible asset that reflects a firm's profit (share prices) is a source of equilibrium indeterminacy.

We find that the announcements of new unsolicited ratings are followed by negative long-run stock performance, while those of new solicited ratings are followed by insignificant long-run stock performance. These results are inconsistent with the conservatism hypothesis that suggests that unsolicited ratings are downward biased. We further demonstrate that firms with solicited upgraded (downgraded) ratings experience subsequent positive (negative) abnormal stock performance, while those with unsolicited rating changes have zero abnormal stock performance. The differential stock performance following rating changes between solicited and unsolicited ratings reflect the differential information carried by each type of rating rather than the biasedness in ratings. Specifically, while solicited ratings are based on both public and private information, unsolicited ratings are mainly based on public information.

It addresses in a first step the 1990's studies in an attempt to understand the developments of the recent literature on this topic. Statistics suggest that employment structure in Europe and United-States tend to polarize into good and bad jobs. As in the 1990 debate, the two factors responsible for this job polarization are skill bias technical change (SETC) and international trade. The job content of occupations becomes a central component of polarization analysis. Offshoring might have had an important impact especially if one analyzes all the channels through which it can affect labor market (change in the organizational structure, service offshoring, defensive innovation). This paper reviews the empirical and theoretical litterature on the effect of offshoring on the labor market but else tries to identify research needs and unexplored trails on this topic.

By focusing on redistributive policy, the analysis sheds light on specific determinants of public opinion. The theoretical analysis, based on the median voter framework, shows that one of the key variables affecting public opinion is the voting rights of migrants. Where migrants do not have the right to vote, their presence negatively impacts the poorest natives. In countries where migrants enjoy voting rights, they are able to vote on redistributive policy; therefore, the impact of migration on natives' welfare is fundamentally different. After the theoretical analysis, the paper proposes an empirical analysis of Europeans' attitudes toward non-Western migrants in European Union countries.

This happens if it does not affect optimal decisions. If the genetic test facilitates better decision-making for at least one possible test outcome, then it has positive private value. This theoretical result seems to contradict the fact that empirically observed take-up rates for genetic tests are surprisingly low. We demonstrate that if individuals display ambiguity aversion, a costless genetic test that does not affect optimal decisions is never taken. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between aversion against uncertainty of test results and utility gains from better decision-making if optimal decisions depend on the level of information. The reason is that, from an ex-ante view, a genetic test introduces uncertainty of probabilities which diminishes the value of information to an ambiguity-averse decision-maker. Ambiguity aversion regarding test results thus provides an explanation for low take-up rates for genetic tests.","[Hoy, Michael] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Peter, Richard; Richter, Andreas] Univ Munich, Inst Risk Management & Insurance, Munich, Germany",University of Guelph; University of Munich,"Peter, R (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Inst Risk Management & Insurance, Munich, Germany.",mhoy@uoguelph.ca; peter@bwl.lmu.de; richter@bwl.lmu.de,"Richter, Andreas/AAR-9090-2021","Richter, Andreas/0000-0002-2588-4813",,,,,44,30,33,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

If diesel is used in industrial activities, the diesel taxes paid can be fully used as a credit against VAT, but if it is used in freight or public transportation - basically trucks and buses - only a fraction of diesel taxes paid can be claimed as a tax credit for VAT payments. As a result of this different tax treatment, firms have incentives to use 'tax-exempted' diesel in activities requiring 'non-tax-exempted' diesel. This tax wedge therefore generates an opportunity for tax evasion, especially for firms with multiple economic activities, one of them being transport. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a tax enforcement programme implemented by the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (IRS), where letters requiring information about diesel purchases and use and vehicle ownership were sent to around 200 firms in 2003. Using different empirical strategies to consider the non-randomness of the selection of firms, the empirical results show consistently that firms receiving a letter decreased their diesel tax credits by around 10 per cent.","[Agostini, Claudio A.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Santiago, Chile; [Claudia Martinez, A.] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad de Chile,"Agostini, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Santiago, Chile.",claudio.agostini@uai.cl; cmartineza@econ.uchile.cl,"Agostini, Claudio A./HLG-7336-2023; Fondap, SERCChile/I-3676-2014","Agostini, Claudio A./0000-0002-3916-1501;",,,,,23,7,8,2,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

At the peak, depositors knew more about deposit insurance, placed more importance on deposit security, and slightly raised their deposits. However, in the aftermath of the crisis the enhanced depositor knowledge proved to be non-permanent while the increased importance of deposit security and the exposure of depositors persisted. The proportion of completely uninformed, strongly involved, and highly exposed depositors, who carry the highest risk of triggering a bank run, was reduced around the peak of the crisis but rebounded strongly afterwards, even exceeding pre-crisis levels.

When this decision was taken, a number of model-based analyses investigated the influence this decision would have on electricity prices and CO2 emissions. They concluded that CO2 emissions would be kept at levels that are in line with national reduction targets but that the phase-out would result in an increase in wholesale electricity prices. We show by means of a sensitivity analysis that results crucially hinge on some fundamental model assumptions. These particularly include the development of fossil fuel and CO2 prices, which have a much larger influence on the electricity price than the nuclear phase-out itself Since the decision of the nuclear phase-out, CO2 prices have decreased and deployment of renewables increased ever since. This partly counteracts the negative effect of the nuclear phase-out on electricity prices, but on the other hand challenges the mitigation of CO2 emissions and security of supply This underlines the importance of sensitivity analyses and suggests that policy-makers need to consider scenarios that analyze the whole range of possible future developments.","[Knopf, Brigitte; Pahle, Michael; Joas, Fabian; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Res Domain Sustainable Solut, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Kondziella, Hendrik; Bruckner, Thomas] Univ Leipzig, IIRM, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] TU Berlin, Chair Econ Climate Change, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Leipzig University; Technical University of Berlin,"Knopf, B (通讯作者)，Res Domain Sustainable Solut, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.",brigitte.knopf@pik-potsdam.de,"Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,41,19,20,0,22,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

To provide evidence on reciprocity in tax compliance decisions, we have conducted a laboratory experiment in which we introduced two types of inequities. The first type of inequity is called vertical, because it refers to inequities introduced by the government when it sets different fiscal parameters for identical taxpayers, while the second type of inequity is called horizontal because it refers to the fact that taxpayers may differ in tax compliance decisions. In this setting, taxpayers may react to a disadvantageous or advantageous inequity through negative or positive reciprocal behaviors, respectively. Our results support the existence of negative and positive reciprocity in both vertical and horizontal cases. When both inequities come into play and may induce reciprocal behaviors in opposite directions, the horizontal always dominates the vertical. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This special section draws attention to the importance of HGFs for future industrial performance, explores their unusual growth trajectories and strategies, and highlights the lack of persistence of high growth. Consequently, while HGFs are important for understanding the economy and developing public policy, they are unlikely to be useful vehicles for public policy given the difficulties involved in predicting which firms will grow, the lack of persistence in high growth levels, and the complex and often indirect relationship between firm capability, high growth, and macro-economic performance.","[Coad, Alex; Nightingale, Paul] Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Coad, Alex] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Coad, Alex] Ratio Inst, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov; Johansson, Dan] HUI Res, SE-10329 Stockholm, Sweden; [Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov] Dalarna Univ, SE-79188 Falun, Sweden; [Hoelzl, Werner] Austrian Inst Econ Res, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Johansson, Dan] Univ Orebro, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden",University of Sussex; Aalborg University; Dalarna University; Orebro University,"Coad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res SPRU, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",A.Coad@sussex.ac.uk; sven-olov.daunfeldt@hui.se; werner.hoelzl@wifo.ac.at; dan.johansson@oru.se; P.Nightingale@sussex.ac.uk,"Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov/N-5386-2019; Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528; Holzl, Werner/0000-0001-8365-9924; Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov/0000-0002-1013-8623; Nightingale, Paul/0000-0002-4155-0880",ESRC [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,74,198,216,3,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This paper aims to evaluate students' attitude towards retailers' social responsibility in implementing the strategic and tactical decisions about product, price, distribution and promotion. It is based on a qualitative research exploring the opinions of the students in business administration about this issue, both as consumers and prospective decision makers in the retail sector. The research was conducted in two focus groups, where the students played the roles of consumers, respectively managers. It was found out that there were differences in the responses of the two groups. The members of the consumers group were emotionally involved and they preferred a demand driven approach that focuses on finding solutions to their needs, while the members of the managers group have adopted a more detached attitude and they were concerned with the identification of gain as a consequence of social responsibility actions.","[Tigu, Gabriela; Tuclea, Claudia-Elena; Vranceanu, Diana-Maria; Vasile, Dragos-Constantin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tigu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",gabriela.tigu@ase.ro,"Diana, Vranceanu/E-1737-2013; Tuclea, Claudia/R-7491-2019; Tigu, Gabriela/AEV-2179-2022; Vranceanu, Diana/L-3115-2019; Vasile, Dragos Constantin/D-1783-2015","Tigu, Gabriela/0000-0001-6189-8027; Vranceanu, Diana/0000-0002-5547-7493; TUCLEA, Claudia-Elena/0000-0002-8104-0041; Vasile, Dragos Constantin/0000-0002-2178-4719",,,,,37,3,3,0,26,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,73,87,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300006,0

The end of the commodities boom and the global return to more normal monetary policy has exposed some weaknesses. Exchange-rate depreciation has absorbed some of the adjustment; but structural rigidities are still likely to limit the expansion of non-commodity sectors, and the increased fuel-subsidy bill for imported oil is putting pressure on the current account and the budget. The immediate focus is on demand-side consolidation to manage inflation and the currentaccount deficit.For an economy like Indonesia's to be overheating, and for monetary and fiscal authorities to be engineering a soft landing, when growth is below 6%, points to major structural problems. If Indonesia is to prevent the current rate of growth from becoming the new normal, there will need to be a substantial supply-side response to lift productivity, as well as a restructuring of the economy and the introduction of policies that make the economy more flexible in adjusting to shocks. The current economic slowdown has yet to trigger sweeping reforms; policy coordination remains problematic as Indonesia enters a big political year.Compared with its neighbours, Indonesia is largely on the outside of the regional production networks, and its manufacturing sector does not play into factory Asia. Now, faced with lower commodity prices globallyand growth in non-resource sectors is critical the lack of a large manufacturing base appears to be a weakness. Indonesia is attracting more foreign direct investment than ever and is climbing the global rankings of preferred economies in which to invest, but this is occurring without improvements to its investment environment or competitiveness. Indonesia can participate more fully in global supply chains and increase its potential for growth by upgrading its infrastructure, improving its investment environment, and using regional initiatives strategically to make strong commitments that reinforce its priorities for domestic reform.In its hosting of APEC in 2013, Indonesia championed infrastructure investment where the lack of structural reform and macroeconomic constraints are inhibiting much-needed expansion, both in Indonesia and in the region. The positive outcome, albeit only a small step forward for the Doha Round, at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali, in December, also builds momentum for better regional and global cooperation. The priority now is for Indonesia to commit to, and show leadership in, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community. Seiring dengan beranjaknya Indonesia menuju pemilihan umum 2014, perekonomian justru menunjukkan tanda-tanda perlambatan. Berakhirnya masa keemasan komoditas dan kembalinya perekonomian global kepada pola kebijakan moneter yang normal telah menyingkap beberapa kelemahan. Depresiasi nilai tukar telah membantu menyerap sebagian kelemahan tersebut, namun kekakuan struktural masih akan membatasi ekspansi sektor-sektor non-komoditas. Selain itu, bertambahnya beban subsidi bahan bakar memberikan tekanan pada transaksi berjalan dan pada anggaran. Fokus jangka pendek adalah konsolidasi sisi permintaan untuk dapat mengelola inflasi dan deficit transaksi berjalan.Bagi ekonomi seperti Indonesia, adanya gejala overheating, dan adanya upaya otoritas moneter dan fiskal untuk menahannya pada saat pertumbuhan di bawah 6%, menunjukkan adanya masalah struktural yang mendalam. Jika Indonesia tidak ingin terperangkap dalam pertumbuhan saat ini sebagai keseimbangan baru, berbagai respon dari sisi penawaran harus dilakukan untuk menaikkan produktivitas, disertai restrukturisasi ekonomi, serta kebijakan-kebijakan yang membuat perekonomian lebih fleksibel terhadap guncangan. Perlambatan ekonomi yang terjadi sekarang belum bisa memicu reformasi yang menyeluruh; kordinasi kebijakan tetap menjadi masalah utama saat Indonesia memasuki tahun politik 2014.Dibandingkan dengan negara-negara tetangganya, Indonesia masih tertinggal dalam hal jaringan produksi regional, dan sektor industri pengolahannya belum terlibat dalam pabrik Asia. Saat ini, dengan turunnya harga komoditas global - dan pertumbuhan sektor-sektor selain sumber daya alam adalah sangat penting - kurangnya basis industri pengolahan menjadi salah satu satu kelemahan utama. Saat ini, Indonesia berhasil menarik investasi asing langsung (FDI) dalam jumlah yang terbesar dibandingkan periode-periode sebelumnya. Posisi Indonesia juga kini tengah berada di antara negara-negara favorit untuk investasi. Namun semua ini terjadi tanpa disertai perbaikan pada iklim investasi atau daya saing. Indonesia dapat berpartisipasi lebih dalam lagi dalam rantai penawaran global sekaligus menaikkan potensi pertumbuhannya dengan menambah kualitas dan jumlah infrastruktur, memperbaiki iklim investasi, serta memanfaatkan inisiatif-inisiatif regional untuk membuat komitmen yang dapat memperkuat prioritas reformasi dalam negeri.Sebagai tuan rumah APEC pada tahun 2013, Indonesia mendorong perlunya investasi infrastruktur di saat kurangnya reformasi struktural dan adanya kendala-kendala makroekonomi menjadi penghambat ekpansi yang sangat dibutuhkan, baik di Indonesia maupun di negara-negara lain. Selain itu, sekalipun konferensi Tingkat Menteri di Bali yang diselenggarakan pada Desember lalu hanyalah sebagian kecil dari langkah bagi Perundingan Doha, keberadaannya juga berhasil membangun momentum bagi kerjasama regional dan global. Saat ini, prioritas Indonesia adalah untuk menunjukkan komitmen dan kepemimpinan di ajang Kerjasama Ekonomi Komprehensif Regional (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership/ RCEP) serta mengimplementasikan Masyarakat Ekonomi ASEAN/ MEA(ASEAN Economic Community/ AEC).","[Armstrong, Shiro] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Rahardja, Sjamsu] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",Australian National University; The World Bank,"Armstrong, S (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Armstrong, Shiro/Q-4118-2019; Burke, Paul J./G-3757-2010; Resosudarmo, Budy P/K-1129-2017","Armstrong, Shiro/0000-0001-9756-7860",,,,,45,5,5,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Marketing ethics is about moral evaluations of decisions and actions as right or wrong on the basis of commonly accepted principles of behaviour in marketing. A survey of academicians was conducted to determine the factors that are related to the academicians' marketing ethics using these dimensions: Collectivism, Uncertainty Avoidance, Power Distance and Professional Values. Marketing ethics is assessed using Vittel Marketing norm scale. From 150 questionnaires distributed to the academicians in higher learning institutions in Malaysia, 124 respondents were collected. Data were analyzed using several methods such as descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression. The findings showed that uncertainty avoidance and professional values were the factors that influence academicians' marketing ethics. Since the result of the study showed that uncertainty avoidance and professional values are the main factors that influence the marketing ethics of academicians, the management of the high learning institutions would perhaps look into methods and ways of cultivating the professionalism among the academicians in order for them to possess a good marketing ethics.

The unexpected conflict, unfortunately, started after the fall of previous regime of Chairman of PSSI, which was followed by the restructuring of the organization along with on-going policy, especially about the prime league and the replacement of national team coach. The increasingly dispute then followed by the formation of the new organization, KPSI, to counter the PSSI, which was continued by dismissal of some core staff that support the rebels. In this paper, two methods for analyzing social conflict Drama Theory and Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) would be utilized. Drama theory is an approach to study the transition of preference toward some states payoff. The entanglement of emotion or new parties might be responsible to this shifting. On the other hand, GMCR is utilized to identify all possible states, along with spotting the equilibrium. In this research, I would like to analyze all discord states, followed by analyzing all possible end results (equilibrium) of the conflict. Previous research showed that some parties were trapped to lose-lose situation that harmed all involved parties, even though there were other states that provided better payoff for them. Therefore, I would like to model the Indonesian Federation conflict with similar approach. It would be very interesting to get insight about the reasons that lead to both PSSI and KPSI to continue their strife rather than mutually exchanging any proposal that might consequence to punishment from FIFA.

If the trading activity of informed investors is an important driver of volatility spreads, then the predictability of stock returns should be more pronounced during major information events. This paper investigates whether the predictability of equity returns by volatility spreads is stronger during earnings announcements. Volatility spreads are measured by the implied volatility differences between pairs of strike price and expiration date matched put and call options and capture price pressures in the option market. During a two-day earnings announcement window, the abnormal returns to the quintile that includes stocks with relatively expensive call options is more than 1.5% greater than the abnormal returns to the quintile that includes stocks with relatively expensive put options. This result is robust after measuring volatility spreads in alternative ways and controlling for firm characteristics and lagged equity returns. The degree of announcement return predictability is stronger when volatility spreads are measured using more liquid options, the information environment is more asymmetric, and stock liquidity is low.

To the credit of these activities, we have improved the efficiency of electricity use in the United States, but it has not been enough to overcome the increasing demand from proliferation of electricity-using devices. In addition, penetration rates for some types of efficient equipment have remained relatively low in certain regions. U.S. electricity demand thus continues to grow. In this paper, we argue that to achieve significantly greater efficiency improvements needed to meet future demand for energy services, we should provide more information to consumers about their energy use and give them more control over this use. While more studies are needed to assess just how far these types of measures can take us, there is enough evidence to show that with better information, consumers often make choices that reduce energy use.","[Bernstein, Mark] Pegasus Capital Advisors, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Collins, Myles] Pardee RAND Grad Sch, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA",RAND Corporation; Pardee RAND Graduate School,"Bernstein, M (通讯作者)，Pegasus Capital Advisors, 505 Pk Ave,21st Floor, New York, NY 10022 USA.",mbernstein@pegadvisors.com; mcollins@rand.org,,,,,,,28,4,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Method - Using a panel of 11 OECD countries from 1920 to 2011 we estimate a panel VAR in order to identify loose monetary policy shocks, low inflation shocks, bank credit shocks, and house price shocks. Findings - We show that during boom periods there is a heightened impact of all three policy shocks with the bank credit shock playing an important role. However, when we look at individual house price boom episodes the cause of the price boom is not so clear. The evidence suggests that the house price boom that occurred in the United States during the 1990s and 2000s was not due to easy bank credit. Research limitations/implications - Shocks from the shadow banking system are not separately identified. These are incorporated into the fourth catch-all shock. Practical implications - Our evidence on housing price booms that expansionary monetary policy is a significant trigger buttresses the case for central banks following stable monetary policies based on well understood and credible rules. Originality/value of paper - This paper uses historical evidence to evaluate the relative importance of three main causes of house price booms. Our results bring into question the commonly held view that loose bank credit was to blame for the U.S. house price bubble of the later 1990s.","[Bordo, Michael D.; Landon-Lane, John] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Bordo, Michael D.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bordo, MD (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",bordo@econ.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,44,8,8,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78350-756-6; 978-1-78350-755-9,INT SYMP EC,,,2014,23.0,,,,,,1,36,,10.1108/S1571-038620140000023001,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358526100001,0

We present trends and cycles of 10%, 5%, 1%, 0,5% and 0,1% income shares estimates which are based on tax statistics. The empirical results indicate that the behavior of the alternative estimated top income shares is quite similar. A 'flat' U-shaped pattern for most cases seems to exist. This common pattern is more apparent for the 1%, 0,5% and 0,1% top income shares. The top 10% and 5% income shares seem to be more volatile, accompanied with an increasing trend by the end of the period. Also, most of the upper income shares yield similar business cycles for the periods 1970-1976, 1976-1984, 1984-1994 and 1998-2007. This paper is an attempt to extend the existing research in southern Europe by presenting the relevant Greek experience.

Using a sample of Canadian-based SMEs, the study shows that the contextual ambidexterity-performance relationship is suppressed at higher levels of internal rivalry and amplified at higher levels of external rivalry. The findings suggest that developing an ambidextrous posture should not be an end by itself, and they point to the need for SMEs to understand how the features of their internal and external environments affect the performance consequences of such posture.","[De Clercq, Dirk; Thongpapanl, Narongsak] Brock Univ, Goodman Sch Business, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Dimov, Dimo] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Brock University; University of Bath,"De Clercq, D (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Goodman Sch Business, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",ddeclercq@brocku.ca; nthongpa@brocku.ca; d.p.dimov@bath.ac.uk,,"Dimov, Dimo/0000-0003-0894-7736",,,,,86,59,66,5,110,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our regression-based decompositions of poverty into growth and redistribution components suggest that around 40% of inequality in total household expenditure in Indonesia was due to variations in expenditure by education characteristics that persisted after controlling for other factors. We find that economic growth in this period benefited households at the top of the expenditure distribution, and that a 'trickle down' effect saw the poor receive proportionately fewer benefits than the non-poor. If reducing poverty is one of the Indonesian government's principal objectives, then policies designed to spur growth must take into account the possible impacts of growth on inequality.","[De Silva, Indunil; Sumarto, Sudarno] TNP2K, Off Vice President, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"De Silva, I (通讯作者)，TNP2K, Off Vice President, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,35,24,25,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

As long as ESF funding is trusted for implementation through a decentralized management mechanism to the Members' State Authorities, those have to comply with reporting objectives to the EC, as set into the European Regulations, including compliance to the sound financial management principle whose three components are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely (SMART). Identifying the most appropriate quantitative methods that could be applied to the measurable elements may be seen as a first step in assisting both: management's decision towards implementation and reporting over the EC objectives. Our study tends to appropriate some quantitative models to the ESF implementation mechanisms, enhancing connections among ESF specific variables: project's budgets and number of individuals receiving labor market related services (also called project's indicators).

Moreover, recent evidence adds to our understanding of how firms are sold (transaction efficiency). Almost half of takeovers involving public targets are initiated by the seller and not by the buyer. Targets are strongly averse to bidder toeholds, and the merger negotiation process strongly protects proprietary information. Takeover premiums leave traces of rational bidding strategies, including bid preemption and winner's curse avoidance. Recent tests employing exogenous instrumentation of bidder valuations reject that bidder shares are systematically overpriced in all-stock bids and suggest that bidder synergy gains are much larger than previously thought.","Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,"Eckbo, BE (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",b.espen.eckbo@dartmouth.edu,"Eckbo, Bjorn Espen/A-7951-2009","Eckbo, Bjorn Espen/0000-0001-6640-6239",,,,,125,37,38,2,57,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4806-9,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

We show that it is optimal to go public when exploiting existing ideas and optimal to go private when exploring new ideas. This result derives from the fact that private firms are less transparent to outside investors than are public firms. In private firms, insiders can time the market by choosing an early exit strategy if they receive bad news. This option makes insiders more tolerant of failures and thus more inclined to invest in innovative projects. In contrast, the prices of publicly traded securities react quickly to good news, providing insiders with incentives to choose conventional projects and cash in early.","[Ferreira, Daniel] London Sch Econ, CEPR, London WC2 2AE, England; [Ferreira, Daniel] ECGI, London, England; [Manso, Gustavo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Silva, Andre C.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London Business School; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Ferreira, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Houghton St, London WC2 2AE, England.",d.ferreira@lse.ac.uk,"Silva, Andre/AAO-3933-2021","Silva, Andre/0000-0002-4907-038X",,,,,53,159,180,5,106,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

It examined supply- and demand-side elements, actual and equilibrium rates of entrepreneurship, institutions and culture. These components were characterized using a dataset consisting of 21 indicators drawn from 184 cities in 20 European countries during the years 1999-2010. The study found that city size, self-employment, and tertiary education have a significant and positive impact on the number of new businesses registered. The implications of these findings are discussed in view of the European Commission's Small Business Act, which provides guidelines for the conception and implementation of entrepreneurship policies in the European Union. This paper's main contribution lies in the differentiation of factors that are context-specific (e.g., city-size) and others that can be influenced by policy (e.g., tertiary education).","Univ Paris Sud, PESOR & European Chair Intellectual Capital Manag, F-92331 Sceaux, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"García, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sud, PESOR & European Chair Intellectual Capital Manag, 54 Bd Desgranges, F-92331 Sceaux, France.",andres.barreneche-garcia@u-psud.fr,,,,,,,51,49,58,2,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Compared to the private sector, accountability expectations and obligations are higher for public enterprises due to public ownership and objectives associated with the public mission. While there is a vast body of literature on public accountability in general, a research gap exists when it comes to linking the general debate of public accountability to sustainability reporting practices of public enterprises. Thus, the paper addresses the research questions about the performance of reporting practices of public enterprises with respect to public accountability and about the state of the art of sustainability reporting of public enterprises in Germany and Austria with respect to accountability. Therefore, this paper combines two research domains, social and environmental accounting research and the accountability of public enterprises. The paper reports the results of a survey, analysing the reporting practices of German and Austrian local public entities in particular. Annual reports and, if available, sustainability reports from 103 Austrian and German cities were examined.","[Greiling, Dorothea; Grueb, Birgit] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Management Accounting, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Greiling, D (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Management Accounting, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",dorothea.greiling@jku.at,"Grüb, Birgit/AAW-1165-2020; Greiling, Dorothea/C-7683-2013","Grüb, Birgit/0000-0001-9568-7279; Greiling, Dorothea/0000-0001-8096-6945",,,,,52,38,40,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Using a model with limits to arbitrage, where we allow arbitrageurs to secure capital even in case of underperformance, we show that arbitrageurs that are more protected from withdrawals have more mean-reverting and volatile returns. Using data on hedge fund performance, we find robust support for these hypotheses: Funds with contractual impediments to withdrawals, and funds with performance-insensitive outflows, recover more quickly after a bad year and have more volatile returns. Our evidence is consistent with the idea that some hedge funds overcome the limits to arbitrage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Market liberalization in Baltic countries has caused an ongoing shift of a decision-making responsibility away from the government toward private consumers. Thus, the pivotal question is whether individuals possess sufficient financial literacy and experience to demonstrate sound financial behaviour. The financial literacy is considered to possess three components: monetary, price and budget literacy. Provided an increasing use of internet nowadays, the aim of the research is to assess to what extent content of current web-based resources in local languages, matches defined components of financial literacy. The tasks of the research are to analyse components, study both local open web-based and internetbanking related financial literacy resources, assess content of resources from the financial literacy perspective. The study conducted on open web-based local resources in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Findings show each country has two universal open web resources while others are mostly dedicated to savings and retirement. Moreover, local resources provide coverage of monetary and budget related literacy only partly while none of them addresses the price literacy. Thus, there is potential for content improvement in open web resources to achieve a broader coverage of financial literacy items as well as include the price literacy perspective. Regression analysis suggests that for both Latvia and Estonia nine out of ten new customers are using internetbanking services and they were discovered to be marginally higher correlated with a number of complaints. Therefore, there is space to improve financial literacy by providing online planning tools built into internetbanking platforms.","[Ijevleva, Ksenija] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Arefjevs, Ilja] BA Sch Business & Finance, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Ijevleva, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",kijevleva@inbox.lv,"Arefjevs, Ilja/IUQ-3756-2023",,,,,,41,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,191,198,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500018,0

Furthermore, the impact of illiquidity on the credit crunch is stronger for less solvent banks. Finally, we find no overall positive effects of central bank liquidity but instead higher hoarding of liquidity.","[Iyer, Rajkamal; Schoar, Antoinette] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, Barcelona GSE, Cass Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [da-Rocha-Lopes, Samuel] Banco Portugal, Nova Sch Business & Econ, European Banking Author, Lisbon, Portugal; [Schoar, Antoinette] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Banco de Portugal; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Peydró, JL (通讯作者)，C Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27,Off 20-224, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",jose.peydro@upf.edu,"Peydró, José-Luis/F-3923-2018","Peydró, José-Luis/0000-0002-4542-7353; Iyer, Rajkamal/0000-0002-3193-0441; Da-Rocha-Lopes, Samuel/0000-0001-7917-6938",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,38,188,234,2,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Transformation leadership consisted of idealized influence, individualized consideration, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation. In addition, this study hypothesized the differing effects of integration strategy and transformational leadership on affective commitment, depending on the status of the organizational members, i.e., managers vs. employees.

One initiative provides funding to improve the quality of child care services at the county level for all children between the ages of 0 to 5, and the other provides funding for preschool slots for disadvantaged four-year-olds. Differences across counties in the timing of the rollout and in the magnitude of the state financial investments per child provide the variation in programs needed to estimate their effects on schooling outcomes in third grade. We find robust positive effects of each program on third-grade test scores in both reading and math. These effects can best be explained by a combination of direct benefits for participants and spillover benefits for others. Our preferred models suggest that the combined average effects on test scores of investments in both programs at 2009 funding levels are equivalent to two to four months of instruction in grade 3.

However, few have examined benchmarking and organizational learning in multiple discplines. The model developed in this paper furthers the understanding of firms' benchmarking of strategies in two discplines, namely marketing and operational (R&D and manufacturing) capabilities.

In recent years it appears that most common way of distributuion in global corporations is cash dividend. In the market we can also face the companies that do not pay cash dividend, and companies that do not pay dividend at all. Nowadays in the market economy, corporates consider the decision to pay dividends as a quite relevant, because in this way is known the remaining cash flow for investment back into the corporation and cash flow distributed to shareholders. A stable dividend policy gives positive signal to shareholders and can be seen as positive corporate performance. Therefore, this paper tends to face the policies which can be applied from companies on dividend distribution and the factors which indicates in following a certain policy.

The instability in their relationship resulting from the animosity in their territorial dispute resolving process could affect the regional relations and potentially the environment of global international relations beyond the region, as well. Therefore it is important to be aware of the dispute resolving process and all the factors which influence it. This study examines the macroeconomic situations in China and Japan and evaluates their current state of development. The aim of the paper to answer a research question was to conduct a multicriterial analysis of the chosen macroeconomic magnitudes and on the basis of the analysis evaluate the economic situation of the countries. Both countries have exceptionally high GDP (gross domestic product) at current prices which indicates production of goods and services as well as the change of price level. The unemployment rate was feasible in both cases, around 4 %, while Chinese development of the discussed indicator can be evaluated as more stable. Both countries experienced deflation during 2008 - 2012, but in the case of China the prevailing phenomenon was inflation, unlike in Japan. Deflation rates in Japan were more apparent. Multicriterial macroeconomic evaluation of these countries 'economic levels is applied to conduct the study while the chosen macroeconomic magnitudes in particular country are examined and compared. The results of research are further used to evaluate interconnections of the economic situation in East Asian countries and their attitudes to the territory dispute-resolving process. Moreover, the study will explain the main interests of countries in the disputing territory. Despite some of the difficulties in both economies, they were evaluated as strong and it was presumed that both Japan and China will try to fortify their position in international relations and presumably will try to negotiate while discussing territory disputes without any compromises that would reduce their economic gains. This presumption was affirmed in the third chapter where it seemed that economic reasons for owning the territory were prevailing (especially when there are mineral reserves found in the vicinity of disputed territory) whereas the strategic position of the territory is an important aspect of resolving disputes, as well.","[Marketa, Heczkova] Univ Econ Prague, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Prague 13000 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,xhecm00@vse.cz,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,3,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,230,242,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200017,0

It is caused by at least three species of bacteria belonging to the genus Borrelia (Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii cause most European cases, whereas Borrelia burgdorferi - is more frequent in North America). Borrelia is transmitted to humans by bite of infected ticks belonging to a few species of the genus Ixodes. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash - erythema migrans. If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, heart, and nervous system. There are very little data about the seroprevalence in our population, furthermore the relation to clinical data has not been previously studied. IFA is a standard test for antibody detection of B burgdoferi sensu lato, since cultural growth of the organism from skin samples and blood is very difficult. The aim of this paper is to find correlation between Lyme disease and tick bites in Macedonian patients. It was done through determining the seroprevalence of Borrelia IgG and IgM antibodies using IFA test and relating that data to reported tick bites. The study was conducted on a sample of 240 patients, after suspected or observed tick bite. Serum samples were collected in a four years period (June 2009-June 2013). Borrelia specific IFA test - RIDA (R) FLUOR Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), R-biopharm, Germany, was performed for IgG and IgM antibody detection. The positive titer was 1:16 for IgM and 1:32 for IgG. The sera were taken at least 10 days after confirmed or suspected thick bite. All patients also answered a short questionnaire regarding the history of a thick bite and previous treatment. Seropositive were 45/240 (18,8%) patients. Concomitant Borrelia IgG and IgM seropositivity was noted in 9 cases, and only IgG or only IgM seropositive were 21 and 15 patients, respectively. A tick bite 10 -60 days prior the testing had been noted in 62/240 (25,8%) patients. The ticks were removed in hospital settings in approximately two thirds of the patients. Seropositivity in either or both classes of antibodies in patients who reported a thick bite was 28,9% (13/45). Erythema migrans as a symptom was noted in 9 patients, all of them reporting a thick bite and being IgG positive. Approximately 50% of the patients bitten by a thick received antibiotic therapy. Having in mind that B burgdorferi in this area is being tested for only few years, the results demonstrate IgG and/or IgM antibody seropositivity of 18,8%, whereas approximately one third of those cases were associated with a tick bite. Very few of those seropositive patients reported any previous symptoms. Those findings suggest that exposure to B burgdorferi does occur in our population, mostly without giving rise to clinical manifestations of Lyme disease. The need of applying precise testing and treatment protocols is obligatory. Further seroprevalence studies on human, as well as on animals are needed in order to create a correlation between seroprevalence of anti- Borelia antibodies with tick bites, which ultimately means better health protection of the population.","[Meloska, Ivanka Hadzi-Petruseva] Avicena Lab, Skopje, Macedonia; [Jankijevic, Anica Hadzi-Petruseva] Clin Hosp Acibadem Sistina, Skopje, Macedonia",,,ivahpm@gmail.com; anicahpj@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,245,254,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000016,0

Design/methodology/approach - The main sources of data used in the study are the large credit database (credit register of the National Bank of Poland (NBP)) and other aggregated data, including data from the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the NBP. Econometric panel logit methods have been used to test how different factors affect bank-firm relationships. Three main groups of factors have been investigated: the characteristics of the firm (i.e., size, ownership type, and R&D activity); the characteristics of the financial sector (i.e., competition in the banking sector); and macroeconomic conditions. Findings - The findings demonstrate that Polish firms readily establish single-bank relationships, and firms with the highest quality of credit portfolios borrow often from multiple creditors. All conducted estimations demonstrated that the relationship between financing from a single bank and from foreign capital had a positive sign. Also, a decrease in concentration in the banking sector, which may be identified with an increase in competition, supports the establishment of relationship banking. Research limitations/implications - The study was performed using the data from large exposure database collected for supervisory purposes. Exposures (credits, derivatives, etc.) larger than 500 thousand PLN (approx. 120 thousand EUR) were only considered. Future research on bank-firm relationships should focus on the influence of financing costs, maintaining relationships when the borrower is in a difficult financial position, and other unique features of banks using the strategy of relationship financing. Practical implications - The understanding of the characteristics of bank-firm relationships can help to improve banking practice and supervisory policy in Poland. Originality/value - This study makes a noticeable contribution to the understanding of the banking sector and its relationships with nonfinancial corporations in Poland. It is the first empirical study on such a large sample of panel data from Polish banking sector and industries, too.","[Pawlowska, Malgorzata; Gajewski, Krzysztof; Rogowski, Wojciech] Natl Bank Poland, Inst Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Pawlowska, Malgorzata; Rogowski, Wojciech] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Warsaw School of Economics,"Pawlowska, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Poland, Inst Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",malgorzata.pawlowska@nbp.pl,"Pawlowska, Malgorzata/AAG-4969-2019","Pawlowska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-2715-5446",,,,,66,0,1,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78350-756-6; 978-1-78350-755-9,INT SYMP EC,,,2014,23.0,,,,,,235,268,,10.1108/S1571-038620140000023009,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358526100009,0

Much of the literature suggests that post-apartheid interventions have not been successful at improving small-scale agriculture, which is seen as an important vehicle for improving rural food security. Nevertheless, data from the General Household Survey (GHS) indicate that household hunger levels have declined substantially in the post-2000 decade across the entire nation (as other estimates of household poverty have also indicated). In particular, this paper demonstrates that this trend has been more pronounced in the former homeland regions, eliminating the previously higher incidence of hunger there. Using linear probability models, this paper seeks to isolate which factors have led to the convergence of the homeland regions' household hunger levels and those of households residing in non-homeland parts of the country. The historical context that is sketched here highlights the severe challenges faced by farmers in former homeland areas; this raises the question how convergence in food security occurred, given that many agricultural interventions in rural areas (also in homelands) have not attained the success that was hoped for. In particular, the proportionately larger reliance on social grants in homelands regions accounts for a part of the faster reduction in hunger levels there. Communal gardens and connections to the agricultural market have also reduced hunger within former homelands regions. The long-term sustainability of grants in bolstering food security is of concern, highlighting the need for greater market integration of small-scale farmers in homeland regions.","[Pienaar, L.] Western Cape Dept Agr, Elsenburg, South Africa; [von Fintel, D.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ & Res Socioecon Policy, Bonn, Germany; [von Fintel, D.] Inst Study Labour IZA, Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Pienaar, L (通讯作者)，Western Cape Dept Agr, Elsenburg, South Africa.",LouwPP@elsenburg.com; dieter2@sun.ac.za,,"von Fintel, Dieter/0000-0001-6771-1315",,,,,27,11,20,0,13,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2014,53.0,4,,,,,38,67,,10.1080/03031853.2014.929014,0.0,,,30,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CD3NU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350986300003,0

Science based and high technology entrepreneurship is seen by many of the governments in emerging economies as the most promising way to stimulate economic growth and create employment Entrepreneurship can contribute in important ways to economic development, one crucial way it does this is through innovation.","[Premkumar, B.; Kalpana, B.; Priya, K.] SRM Univ, MBA Dept, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India",SRM Institute of Science & Technology Chennai,"Premkumar, B (通讯作者)，SRM Univ, MBA Dept, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India.",bpkind@gmail.com; kalpax4@gmail.com; priyadrew@gmail.com,"Balaraman, Premkumar/AGJ-0934-2022","Balaraman, Premkumar/0000-0003-1188-326X",,,,,43,0,0,1,19,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,160,177,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300013,0

Few days later, severe floods drove to the destruction of the almost entire city. In the months following the disaster, the Government developed projects that failed to relocate the city to a safer location as well as strategies to support the affected population aimed to improve community resilience. Contradictory institutional policies as well as the unforeseen effects of implemented bond schemes have resulted in a highly segregated and environmentally unjust city where public policies' outputs are unevenly distributed. Thus, this paper addresses how some related processes of increasing resilience may impact negatively upon environmental justice, hence exploring a potential inverse relationship between resilience and environmental justice. Five years on, nearly half of the population have returned to Chaiten despite the refusal of the authorities. While northern Chaiten concentrates most of the population and investment, 160 families living in the southern Chaiten bear the lack of potable water and other basic services, and are more vulnerable to future disaster impacts. Split in two due to both geography and policies, Chaiten faces now two realities. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier BA/.

A review of existing theories and practical experiences is undertaken to build the core conceptual model. The underlying assumption behind the model is to consider the Entrepreneurial University as a Collective intelligence system in which the tangible and Intellectual assets are coordinate toward the achievement of the third mission goal. The conceptual model harnesses the power of IC collectively created by the engagement of multiple stakeholders inside the University network. Taking the metaphor form the biology, the model is broken down in four main blocks or genes harnessing the IC collectively created. The genes are particular answer to the four questions: what is being done? Who is doing it? How is done? Why is done?. These questions provide the conceptual pillars to describe, respectively, an overall approach to IC management articulated in the final goal of an entrepreneurial University, the collective Human capital to achieve the goal, the processes activated inside the University and finally the motivations behind the achievement of the goal. The creation and management of IC is thus an operational priority to evaluate the alignment between the strategic orientation and the performance within a university contributing to the regional development. Even if the research has to be considered as exploratory, the model is comprehensive because it can thus represent a useful ground for refinements, mostly related to the links between creation, measurement and management of IC. Moreover, the approach can be used to strategically manage IC in other systems interpreted as collective intelligence systems in which the role of IC creation and management from multiple actors is relevant. The originality of the paper resides in bringing together issues that are usually dealt in literature separate domain such as Intellectual Capital Management and Collective intelligence perspective.","[Secundo, Giustina; Passiante, Giuseppina; Gianfreda, Federica; Passabi, Stefania] Univ Salento, Dept Innovat Engn, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Secundo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Innovat Engn, Lecce, Italy.",giusy.secundo@unisalento.it; giuseppina.passiante@unisalento.it; federicagianfreda@hotmail.com; spassabi@libero.it,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,209,216,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000026,0

The author considers the usual delay in response of the social structures to the challenges of governmental institutions, initially requiring economic and social development acceleration, to be the manifestation of their mutual conditionality. The historical reason for this delay is the fact that the social structures evolution has a continuous character, whilst the changes of governmental institutions are discontinuous.

The topic of this contribution is the potential risky aspects of banks 'growth strategies when providing loans in the Czech Republic's real economic environment. The starting point of this contribution is a basic analysis of evolutions in the Czech bank sector over the past 10 years relating to loan portfolio development and structure and the capital adequacy of banks in the context of the overall macro-economic developments - GDP, average wages, etc. For research into the given problems, topical empirical methods of observation were selected based on the systematic collection of historical data, primarily from the available public sources - the Czech National Bank, the European Central Bank and the annual reports of banks operating in the Czech Republic. These data reveal that the actual situation of the Czech banking industry does not demonstrate, according to the basic parameters tracked by the CNB and ECB, negative or high risk aspects. Potential risk, on the long-term horizon, can be perceived and identified predominantly in the following areas. Firstly, the dynamic growth in volumes of loans provided to entrepreneurial and domestic household clients as well as the municipalities and local administrations is greater than the realistic macro-economic growth. Secondly, the risk can also be seen in the growing indebtedness of Czech households compared to the owned assets.","[Zbrankova, Hana] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,hzbrankova@amaco.cz,,"Zbrankova, Hana/0000-0001-7263-7543",,,,,17,0,0,0,3,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,757,768,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200055,0

Nonaltruists showed neural activation patterns that were consistent with expressive voting motives.

Our method provides also an exact closed form solution via Fourier inversion of the exchange option price, generalizing the Margrabe (1978) formula.

Given the new sources of liquidity generated by off-balance-sheet activities, time-varying indicators of leverage become more informative of the leverage dynamics. We introduce a Kalman filter procedure to study such elasticity-based measures of broad leverage. This approach enables the detection of the build-up of financial imbalances as measured by the increase in bank risk years before what the traditional assets to equity ratio predicts. Most elasticity measures we propose appear in line with the historical episodes, well tracking the cyclical pattern of leverage. Importantly, the degree of total leverage suggests that market-oriented banking exerts a stronger influence on leverage during expansion periods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our results are more pronounced in families that have voting-cash flow rights divergence and that operate in high-tech industries.

The unified methodology that this work presents for extracting, storing and analyzing PT data enables relatively easy spatial analysis with GIS techniques based solely on: (a) Google Transit feeds and (b) Transportation networks. In order to implement this new methodology for analyzing a PT system, five connectivity indicators are introduced: (a) transportation network coverage level; (b) average speed; (c) intersection coverage level; (d) stop transfer potential; and (e) route overlap.

Using the expectations hypothesis of the term structure as a benchmark model for the determination of the overnight interest swap rates, we find that after May 2010 the monetary transmission mechanism was partially restored when the ECB implemented various 'unconventional measures' in response to the financial crisis. On the contrary, liquidity and credit risks are still present in unsecured deposit markets, distorting the pricing and transmission of the ECB monetary policy stance along the Euribor rates.

Using a more appropriate classification, we find no evidence that agricultural performance of Indian districts in the post-independence period was adversely affected by the landlord land revenue system.","[Iversen, Vegard; Sen, Kunal] Univ Manchester, IDPM, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Palmer-Jones, Richard] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Sen, Kunal] Univ Manchester, BWPI, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of East Anglia; University of Manchester,,vegard.iversen@manchester.ac.uk; r.palmer-jones@uea.ac.uk; Kunal.Sen@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,28,21,21,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Since active firms tend to have large market capitalizations, studies that use PIN have excluded as much as 40% of total market capitalization from their sample. Similarly, since trading tends to be more intense around important events, studies that use PIN may lose observations exactly during periods that are the focus of study. A simple procedure, using scaled trade counts, allows PIN to be estimated for actively-traded firms, avoiding the possible biases or false generalizations that may occur when data from large firms or important events is ignored.

This paper shows that the explanatory power of the ICAPM application by Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) relies critically on the computation of Dimson (1979) covariances (betas). If one employs the standard factor covariances (excluding lagged factors), the two-factor ICAPM has virtually no explanatory power for the average returns of the 25 size/book-to-market portfolios. More specifically, it is the covariance with the lagged innovation in one of the state variables (the value spread) that drives the explanatory power of the model. These results are inconsistent with the central economic intuition from the ICAPM. By specifying a more general version of the ICAPM, the fit of the model improves relative to the Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, contrary to the findings in prior studies, we find that stock exchange IPO underpricing is positively related to the firm's long-run stock returns. We argue, among others, that the lack of managerial ownership of shares in the stock exchange firms creates a situation where management is not constrained to significantly underprice their initial issues to signal their firms' prospects, because they do not directly bear the cost of leaving too much money on the table. Interestingly, both underpricing and long-run returns of stock exchange IPOs are related to proxies of the signaling hypothesis. On the basis of additional tests involving the stock exchange IPOs and a sub-sample of regular IPOs that also outperformed the market in the long run, we are able to rule out the quasi-monopoly hypothesis as a possible explanation for the strong long-run performance of stock exchange IPOs.

Do CEOs receive large pay because of their unique abilities? We examine those questions using one such ability - the ability to forecast future firm risks - because over the last 40years, firms' survival and success has become highly dependent on firms' preparedness to face uncertain future business environments. We measure CEOs' risk-forecasting ability by the information contained in their personal equity trades. We find that CEOs' earlier-than-normal stock-option exercises often represent modifications of their personal portfolios in anticipation of future risks unknown to the market today. These results suggest that on average, CEOs can forecast at least some future firm risks better than the market can, and they use that information to modify their personal portfolios. Additional tests show that firms design incentive-compatible compensation contracts by tying high-powered components of CEO compensation to their risk-forecasting abilities, arguably, to competitively sort and attract CEOs with better risk-forecasting abilities and/or to motivate them to expend greater efforts on forecasting risks. We conclude that increases in CEO pay over the last 40years can be explained, at least partly, by the increasing importance of risk-forecasting skills, especially because firms have become smaller and are more susceptible to failure due to sudden changes in the business environment, but are also more likely to benefit from opportunities created by those changes.","Northwestern Univ, Accounting Informat & Management Dept, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Srivastava, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Accounting Informat & Management Dept, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",anup-srivastava@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Srivastava, Anup/V-2197-2019","Srivastava, Anup/0000-0001-5646-614X",,,,,122,3,6,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

During economic downturns, the asset betas and leverage of value firms increase, contributing to a sharp rise in equity betas. Asset betas of growth firms are much less sensitive to economic conditions, and, consistent with the tradeoff theory of capital structure, growth firms are also less levered, contributing to the relative stability of their equity betas. By incorporating instruments that better capture beta dynamics, I show that the interactions of conditional betas with the market risk premium and volatility explain approximately 40% of the unconditional value premium.","Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Choi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, 1206 S 6th St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",jaewchoi@illinois.edu,,"Choi, Jaewon/0000-0002-0224-9067",,,,,44,55,61,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The determinants we use are grouped into domestic and euro-area aggregates, thus allowing us to derive results on their relative explanatory power and compare them across time and the spectrum of countries. We find that volatility influences the deterministic processes of the euro area sovereign spreads and that identical determinants have effects on spreads that vary considerably across countries. Furthermore, we find that variables reflecting investment confidence conditions and perceptions for the upcoming economic activity are significant determinants and their significance remains, to a large extent, even when controlling for fiscal variables.

The starting point is the consumer with his needs, hopes and ideals related to the quality of products and services. Customer satisfaction is the priority goal of economic activities carried out to improve the quality of life while guiding modern corporate strategies. Creators, consumers and managers understand and pursue the same objectives related to conservation of material resources, minimizing energy consumption and improving the environmental impact of waste. Rethinking concepts, developing ecological projects and products, modern companies use sustainable design to accommodate environmental criteria but also to give ethical, social and environmental meaning to their actions, or in other words, to develop responsible business. Accepting the major influence that design has on the quality of life and the environment, the study undertaken aims to highlight this concern in the case of manufacturing companies by presenting the consumer's reaction to their products. With the conceptual model as theoretical background, an appropriate questionnaire was developed and applied, with the purpose of demonstrating the significant contribution of design in making businesses meet the needs of sustainable development.","[Pamfilie, Rodica; Procopie, Roxana; Bobe, Magdalena; Visan, Smaranda; Bumbac, Robert] Acad Studii Econ Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pamfilie, R (通讯作者)，Acad Studii Econ Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania.",rodica.pamfilie@com.ase.ro,"Procopie, Roxana/ABC-8593-2020; Bumbac, Robert/AAD-3830-2019","Procopie, Roxana/0000-0002-2295-0678; Bumbac, Robert/0000-0002-7288-7400",,,,,9,3,3,0,26,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2013,15.0,,,,7,,573,582,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,268IU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328164400002,0

In this paper we analyze to what extent downward wage rigidities can explain these empirical business cycle asymmetries. To this aim, we introduce asymmetric wage adjustment costs in a New-Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the labor market. Increasing wages is less costly than cutting them. It follows that wages increase relatively fast and thus limit vacancy posting and employment creation, but they decline more slowly, leading to a strong reduction in vacancies and employment. The presence of downward wage rigidities strongly improves the fit of the model to the observed skewness of labor market variables and the relative length of expansions and contractions in the output and the employment cycles. The asymmetry also explains the differing transmission of positive and negative monetary policy shocks from wages to inflation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using an Integrated Assessment Model with a game-theoretic structure we find that the equilibrium abatement of the coalition composed by OECD countries would be moderate, in line with the Pledges subscribed in Copenhagen, but increasing. The mitigation strategy would consist of investments in energy R&D and deployment of cleaner technologies with high learning potentials. International knowledge and technology externalities would facilitate the diffusion of cleaner technologies in non-signatory countries, offsetting the free-riding incentive and reducing their emissions. If the OECD group curbs emissions beyond the optimal equilibrium level, reaching reduction rates between 40 and 45 % below 2005 levels in 2050, the benefits of technology externalities would no longer compensate the effect of lower fossil fuel prices. Our results suggest that a moderate unilateral climate policy could induce a virtuous behaviour in non-signatory countries and that policies promoting the international transfer of technologies and knowledge could represent an effective complement to mitigation targets.","[Bosetti, Valentina; De Cian, Enrica] Fdn ENI Enrico Mattei FEEM, I-30124 Venice, Italy; [Bosetti, Valentina; De Cian, Enrica] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, I-30124 Venice, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"De Cian, E (通讯作者)，Fdn ENI Enrico Mattei FEEM, I-30124 Venice, Italy.",enrica.decian@feem.it,"DE CIAN, Enrica/AAA-1237-2021","DE CIAN, Enrica/0000-0001-7134-2540; bosetti, valentina/0000-0003-4970-0027",,,,,43,11,11,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

While many empirical studies emphasized that grants encourage the growth of local public spending and local taxes constrain it, they are more silent regarding the effects of different types of tax autonomy. The paper addresses this issue by arguing that tax decentralization as organized on tax bases used only by local governments (tax-separation), rather than on tax-base sharing, would restrain local public expenditures. Using an unbalanced panel of OECD countries, the key finding is that only property taxes-mostly based on a tax-separation scheme-seem to favor smaller local governments. Thus, while tax decentralization is a necessary condition for limiting the growth of local governments, it does not appear sufficient, as tax-separation schemes among government levels would in fact be required.","[Liberati, Paolo; Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy; [Liberati, Paolo] CEFIP, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Liberati, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy.",paolo.liberati@uniroma3.it; asacchi@uniroma3.it,,"Sacchi, Agnese/0000-0002-7754-8360; LIBERATI, Paolo/0000-0002-6317-9701",,,,,64,40,41,0,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2013,157.0,1-2,,,,,183,205,,10.1007/s11127-012-9937-9,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,213WI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324090700012,0

Use of restricted-access data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study allowed us to identify household location from a nationally representative sample of students and to match households to the actual schools attended and other nearby schools. This matching is significant as previous research generally has not been able to link individual households to school enrollment decisions. Using these data, we examined the role that socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity play in school enrollment decisions. One of our more interesting results suggests that the newest public alternative, charter schools, attracts families with higher socioeconomic status than those that traditional public schools attract. The attraction of charter schools, however, unlike traditional public schools, appears to be racially and ethnically neutral. Families do not choose a charter school because of its racial or ethnic composition, nor do race and ethnicity within a household influence its choice of charter schools. Other socioeconomic factors influencing charter school choice are more similar to factors explaining private school choice than to those factors explaining the choice of traditional public schools. The findings suggest that policies governing the design of charter schools should focus on broader socioeconomic diversity rather than race only.","[Butler, J.

We used the random assignment in Project STAR (the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio experiment) to estimate the effect of smaller classes in primary school on college entry, college choice, and degree completion. We improve on existing work in this area with unusually detailed data on college enrollment spells and the previously unexplored outcome of college degree completion. We found that assignment to a small class increases students' probability of attending college by 2.7percentage points, with effects more than twice as large among black students. Among students enrolled in the poorest third of schools, the effect is 7.3percentage points. Smaller classes increased the likelihood of earning a college degree by 1.6percentage points and shifted students toward high-earning fields such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), business, and economics. We found that test-score effects at the time of the experiment were an excellent predictor of long-term improvements in postsecondary outcomes.","[Dynarski, Susan] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Sch Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dynarski, Susan; Hyman, Joshua] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dynarski, Susan; Schanzenbach, Diane Whitmore] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hyman, Joshua] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Schanzenbach, Diane Whitmore] Northwestern Univ, Sch Educ & Social Policy, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Northwestern University,"Dynarski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Sch Educ, Weill Hall,735 South State St,5212, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Dynarski, Susan/GOP-1216-2022",,,,,,43,75,108,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

In response to the crisis, the Uruguayan government increased public consumption and investment and expanded social benefits to unemployed workers. We apply a computable general equilibrium model linked to microsimulations to analyze the distributional impacts of these policies and assess their effectiveness. We find that an increase in public investment was the only policy effective in mitigating the negative impact of the crisis on extreme poverty. The other policies reinforced the negative impact of the crisis on the poor. All three policies are costly and have an important impact on macroeconomic variables and the structure of production and export, while they have only slight or negative results on poverty and household income.

By examining the drivers of cash policies for each group, we are able to attribute the difference to the much higher agency costs in public firms. By combining evidence from across public and private firms as well as within public firms across different qualities of governance, we are able to reconcile existing mixed evidence on the effects of agency problems on cash policies.

It finds that debt is socially regulated in the sense that social interactions shape the cost, use and access to debt. Caste, social class and location affect how individuals borrow varying amounts from distinct money providers, for varied purposes and at differing costs. Debt thus is not purely an economic but first and foremost a social transaction which inscribes debtors and creditors into local systems of hierarchies. Furthermore, we find that debt is an illustration and catalyst of broader socio-economic and political trends, namely a lack of social protection, persistent under-employment and rising consumerism. In terms of policy implications, the study highlights the ambiguities and illusions inherent to financial inclusion' policies aiming to eradicate informal debt.","[Guerin, Isabelle] Univ Paris 01, Inst Dev Res, UMR Dev & Soc 201, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Guerin, Isabelle; Venkatasubramanian, Govindan] French Inst Pondicherry, Pondicherry, India; [D'Espallier, Bert] Hogesch Univ Brussel, KU Leuven, Brussels, Belgium",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); KU Leuven,"Guérin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Inst Dev Res, UMR Dev & Soc 201, 45 Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",isabelle.guerin@ird.fr,"Guerin, Isabelle/AAU-4398-2021","D'Espallier, Bert/0000-0001-7567-2520",,,,,76,45,47,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Our main focus is on debt dynamics during 40 consolidation periods. To define these periods we use data on the evolution of the underlying cyclically adjusted primary balance, and as such avoid biases that may be induced by one-off budgetary measures. The paper brings new evidence on the role of public sector efficiency for the success of fiscal consolidation. First, we confirm that consolidation programs imply a stronger reduction of the public debt ratio when they rely mainly on spending cuts, except public investment. Government wage bill cuts, however, only contribute to lower public debt ratios when public sector efficiency is low. Second, we find that a given consolidation program will be more effective in bringing down debt when it is adopted by a more efficient government apparatus. Third, more efficient governments adopt consolidation programs of better composition. As to other institutions, consolidation policies are more successful when they are accompanied by product market deregulation, and when they are adopted by left-wing governments. By contrast, simultaneous labor market deregulation may be counterproductive during consolidation periods. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that banks with short-term investment intensity pay more cash bonus, exhibit higher risk and perform more poorly than banks with longer-term investment intensity. This evidence is broadly consistent with the view that short-term means of compensation encouraged a short-term investment focus, which in turn led to both higher risk and resulted in poorer performance, culminating in the sub-prime crisis. The inverse risk-performance relation suggests pay schemes were incongruent with shareholders' interest. Moreover, pay arrangements used in banks prior to the subprime crisis exposed banks to the ex-post settling up problem (the clawback problem). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis concentrates on the supply side of the labor market whereby the demographic features and the labor supply characteristics are interrelated. According to the population projections the Demographic Window of Opportunity has started in Turkey in 2010 and will end in 2040. During this period the working age population of Turkey will reach high levels and could potentially contribute to the growth and development in Turkey Provided that the quality of the working age population could be increased and that necessary employment could be generated, Turkey will benefit from the Demographic Window of Opportunity and otherwise there will be risks involved.

Further, the thrust of the book is the provision of projections for the labor force participation employment and unemployment rates and numbers for the period 2010-2050 by gender and total under three different scenarios about the economic and educational developments. Final part of the book provides general evaluation and policy proposals about the labor market participation of youth, women and old-age groups in terms of education, skills generation and skills upgrading in order to create the educated, skilled and healthy labor force of the future. Investments in technological developments and research and deveolopment are also emphasized.

Unlike previous approaches, tests based on PTCMs can simultaneously detect departures from rational expectations and time varying term premia. We set out analytically and empirically the links across previous tests and PTCMs. We also show that PTCMs identify an additional restriction for rational expectations, on top of the one-to-one relationship between forward and spot rates, that must be imposed in estimations of term premia. Data for the short-end of the US term structure suggest that both factors contribute to the rejection of the EHTS. Moreover, the empirical estimates of term premia are persistent and exhibit sign fluctuations. Their stochastic properties depend crucially on whether the additional restriction for rational expectations is imposed in estimation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Barring a calamitous pandemic, a further increase in the world's population from 7 to between 8.8 and 10 billion by mid-century is unavoidable. This increase is driven by high fertility in sub-Saharan Africa whose population is forecast to more than double in the next 40 years and by a modest rise of 23 % in Asia's huge population. Beyond mid-century, the range of plausible demographic destinations widens; much depends on fertility rates in the next few decades because they will determine the number of potential reproducers in the second half of the century. Vigorous promotion of family planning, particularly in Africa, is crucial to achievement of population stabilisation. Unchanged fertility implies a global population of 25 billion by the end of the century. In the next few decades the contribution of human population growth to global environmental change is moderate, because nearly all growth will occur in poor countries where consumption and emission of greenhouse gases is low. The implications for food production, and thereby water consumption, are greater. Much of the future need for food will be driven by increased numbers rather than changing diets. Loss of bio-diversity and natural habitats, degradation of fragile eco-systems due to over-exploitation and aquifer deletion are likely consequences.","London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Populat Hlth, London WC1, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Cleland, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Populat Hlth, London WC1, England.",John.Cleland@lshtm.ac.uk,"Cleland, John G./AAZ-4185-2020","Cleland, John G./0000-0002-1471-7016",,,,,31,60,73,7,189,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The identities of the chief executive officer (CEO) and the chairman of the board (COB) were used to establish whether the management of the firm can be characterized as founder, descendant, or external management. A unique, unbalanced panel data set on listed Swedish firms covering the period from 1990 to 2005 was used in the analysis. The results show that founder management has a positive effect on the returns on investment in family firms, whereas descendant management has a negative impact. An external CEO as a successor in family firms leads to more efficient investment policies with increased firm value as a result. That is, when studying corporate governance in family firms it is important to account for what type of management the firm has. Further studies are required to understand the relationship between ownership, control, management, and firm performance.","[Eklund, Johan; Wiberg, Daniel] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan; Palmberg, Johanna] Ratio Inst, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wiberg, Daniel] Minist Finance, S-10333 Stockholm, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Eklund, J (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",johan.eklund@jibs.hj.se; johanna.palmberg@ratio.se; daniel.wiberg@jibs.hj.se,"Eklund, Johan/HPC-9141-2023",,,,,,56,22,25,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The Bank of Korea's exchange rate policy reports during the East Asian crisis suggest that its fixed exchange rate regime was forced to collapse due to the depletion of usable foreign reserves, which resulted from the credit policy of the Korean central bank to support domestic banks in need of foreign currency liquidity. To capture the Korean crisis experience, I build a quantitative small open economy model in which, in response to the country risk premium shock, the foreign-currency credit policy of a central bank under fixed regime leads to the exhaustion of international reserves and consequent exchange rate regime shift. This model does well at replicating the observed contraction in Korean aggregate variables. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, our analysis focuses on the impact of these three innovation categories on micro, meso, and macro aggregates.

Furthermore, we have paid particular attention to the role of credit market in promoting smart growth.

This article aims to provide a systematic examination of how investors' subjective and affective evaluations of companies' products and brands, in particular, may influence investors' propensities to consider those companies as investment targets. The author hypothesizes the effects by applying psychological consumer behavior theories and tests the hypotheses with data gathered from 292 individual investors. The results show that the personal relevance that an investor attaches to a particular company's product domain decreases the consideration that the investor gives to alternative investment targets, while investing in that company's stock. The investor's affective evaluation of the company's product brand has a similar effect. Moreover, the results show that an investor's affective evaluation of a company's brand increases his optimism about the financial returns of the company's stock. Finally, the results suggest that contrary to what might be expected, an investor's familiarity with the company's brand does not decrease the consideration that he gives to alternative investment targets, nor is brand familiarity linked to overconfidence about the financial returns of the company's stock.","[Aspara, Jaakko] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, FI-00076 Aalto Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University,"Aspara, J (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Mkt, Sch Business, POB 21230, FI-00076 Aalto Helsinki, Finland.",jaakko.aspara@aalto.fi,"Aspara, Jaakko/G-2205-2013","Aspara, Jaakko/0000-0001-7982-5053",,,,,102,22,27,0,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The analysis aims to determine the circumstances under which there is issue convergence (both parties emphasizing the same issue) or issue divergence (different parties emphasizing different issues) during a political campaign. For this purpose, the concepts of a party's absolute and comparative advantage are used. A party has an absolute advantage on an issue if a majority of voters prefer its position on this issue to that of its opponent. A party has a comparative advantage on an issue if the percentage of votes that it would obtain if voters cared only about that issue is larger than those that it would obtain if voters cared only about the other issue. It is shown here that issue convergence can occur only if one of the parties has an absolute advantage on both issues, but its comparative advantage is not too large. Otherwise, there will be issue divergence in the political campaign.","[Amoros, Pablo; Socorro Puy, M.] Univ Malaga, Dpto Teoria & Hist Econ, Malaga 29013, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Amorós, P (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dpto Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, Malaga 29013, Spain.",pag@uma.es; mps@uma.es,"Puy, M.

The integral investigation of the determining factors, as well as the impact of outsourcing on innovation and productivity based on the same data in a comparative setting (Switzerland versus Greece) are important new elements and contributions of this study to the existing empirical literature. It has been concluded that in both countries more innovative firms (R&D) were stronger inclined to outsourcing activities than less innovative ones, whereas on the contrary, the educational level of employees and the labor cost showed no effect on outsourcing in both countries. Also, the intensity of ICT use and organizational aspects, especially those related to the formal structure of workplace organization, were relevant for the Swiss firms but not for the Greek firms. With respect to the impact of outsourcing on performance, it has been concluded that it tends to enhance innovation, particularly process innovation, but only weakly productivity (at least directly).","[Arvanitis, Spyros] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Loukis, Euripidis N.] Univ Aegean, Dept Informat & Commun Syst Engn, Karlovassi Samos 83200, Greece",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Aegean,"Arvanitis, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",arvanitis@kof.ethz.ch; eloukis@aegean.gr,"Loukis, Euripides/AAM-5382-2021",,,,,,66,19,20,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

As in other countries, immediate impacts of the recession on net household incomes are remarkably hard to detect, but the pain was merely delayed until 2010-11 and beyond. We find that the major difference between income groups is in the timing of the reductions in income, rather than in their magnitude. For those in the middle and upper parts of the distribution, dependent mainly on labour market income, falls in real income happened largely between 2009-10 and 2011-12. For those towards the bottom, dependent more on benefit incomes, falls in real income will happen largely as a result of the post-recession fiscal tightening between 2010-11 and 2015-16.

Genetically modified (GM) seeds are produced each year in a controlled environment to maintain their purity. However, pollen from the GM crop can be transferred to traditional crops. When the GM crop producers are in long-run equilibrium and buy seeds from a monopolistic seed producer, the resulting market equilibrium is identical to that when a seed monopolist produces the GM crop directly. When involuntary genetic contamination occurs, the monopolist eventually loses its advantage and stops its protection of GM seeds. A terminator gene can stop genetic contamination but imposes spillover costs on the traditional producers and reduces their outputs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Choi, E.

Empirical evidence is decidedly mixed. In this study, we use 19 years of monthly stock price returns, from 1991 to 2009, to examine the profitability of participation in CCX, a large voluntary greenhouse gas mitigation program. After controlling for systemic market risk as well as industry-specific shocks, we find statistically significant and positive excess returns for firms that announce their decision to join CCX. In addition, the progress of proposed greenhouse gas legislation (the Waxman-Markey bill) had a positive and large impact on excess returns for CCX member firms, suggesting that a major incentive for firms to join CCX may be to prepare for future regulation. Marginal abatement costs (proxied by the carbon price), on the other hand, were unrelated to excess returns. Our results imply that voluntary approaches should play a role in combating climate change, but that relying on them alone is not enough.","[Gans, Will] NERA Econ Consulting, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Hintermann, Beat] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Hintermann, B (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",will.gans@nera.com; b.hintermann@unibas.ch,,,,,,,51,17,17,1,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Its focus is on Shanghai, the world's largest port, which began direct trade relations with Western nations starting in 1843. The paper finds that Shanghai had, and continues to have, an important role in China's trade structure. Applying the well-known gravity equation of trade for Shanghai's treaty port period, the paper shows that this relationship fits today's actual trade quite well when projected into the modern period. Second, the foreign presence, as measured by foreign direct investment (FDI), in Shanghai is shown to be related not only to trade in the past, but also to trade today, which suggests that FDI is one of the sources of persistence in foreign trade.","[Keller, Wolfgang; Shiue, Carol H.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Keller, Wolfgang; Shiue, Carol H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Li, Ben] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Bureau of Economic Research; Boston College,"Keller, W (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,"Keller, Wolfgang/AAI-9160-2020","Keller, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2834-6516; SHIUE, CAROL/0000-0003-1890-318X",,,,,56,17,24,0,44,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

We find evidence that the greater sensitivity to uncertainty is basically due to the greater opacity of family firms and to their higher risk aversion, rather than to the degree of sunk fixed capital as is typical in the literature on investment decisions.","[Bianco, Magda; Parigi, Giuseppe] Bank Italy, Res Dept, Rome, Italy; [Bontempi, Maria Elena; Golinelli, Roberto] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; University of Bologna,"Golinelli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, Bologna, Italy.",roberto.golinelli@unibo.it,"Golinelli, Roberto/F-1605-2013; bontempi, maria elena/F-4927-2012","Golinelli, Roberto/0000-0003-1107-6417; bontempi, maria elena/0000-0001-9633-3499",,,,,70,81,85,3,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

When operating leverage is economically significant, both value firms and low book-leverage firms can have high equity risk premiums. In particular, value premium becomes positive while book-leverage premium becomes negative. Without operating leverage, the signs of these premiums are reversed.

J,"Yesin, P",,,,"Yesin, Pinar",,,Foreign Currency Loans and Systemic Risk in Europe,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Foreign currency loans to the unhedged non-banking sector are remarkably prevalent in Europe and create a significant exchange-rate-induced credit risk to European banking sectors. In particular, Swiss franc (CHF) -denominated loans, popular in Eastern European countries, could trigger simultaneous bank failures if depreciation of the domestic currencies prevents unhedged borrowers from servicing the loans. Foreign currency loans thus pose a systemic risk from a common market shock perspective. The author uses a novel dataset of foreign-currency loans from 17 countries for 2007-11 (collected by the Swiss National Bank) and builds on the method suggested by Ranciere, Tornell, and Vamvakidis (2010) to quantify this systemic risk. The author finds that systemic risk is substantial in the non-euro area, while it is relatively low in the euro area. However, CHF-denominated loans are not the underlying source of the high systemic risk: Loans denominated in other foreign currencies (probably to a large extent in euros) contribute significantly more to the systemic risk in the non-euro area than CHF-denominated loans. Furthermore, systemic risk shows high persistence and low volatility during the sample period. The author also finds that banks in Europe have continuously held more foreign-currency-denominated assets than liabilities, indicating their awareness of the exchange-rate-induced credit risk they face.","[Yesin, Pinar] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Yesin, P (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO USA.",,,", Pinar/0000-0003-4818-6951",,,,,22,36,36,0,11,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

One proposed sustainable economic development strategy to help protect the biodiversity and indigenous cultures of this region is to grow and transport locally produced organic crops to markets outside the region. Transportation options include for-hire modes such as small planes that can land at grass airstrips and truck transport available from only one node. Other options include self-owned modes such as motorized canoes, which can be purchased and based at certain villages for use on a few navigable rivers. To analyze this unique logistics problem, this paper develops a hybrid mixed-integer linear programming model combining elements from cost-minimizing multimodal network flow models and location-routing models with vehicle-capacity constraints. Because of the small volumes shipped, the keys to minimizing transport costs for both for-hire and self-owned modes are the economies of scale of larger vehicles as well as high utilization of the capacity of those vehicles. The model solves for optimal modes, sizes, routes, bases, stops, and volumes, as well as location of storage and transshipment facilities. The five different scenarios demonstrate the substantial cost savings achievable with network optimization as opposed to direct routing from each community. This type of model. could be adapted to help address logistics problems facing other inaccessible regions in mountainous, polar, or rainforest ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By looking at these capitals in the context of a rural Mapuche community in the Andean foothills, in the local area of Curarrehue (Araucania Region), it is possible to discern the different challenges being faced and how these can be contextualized in terms of poverty and vulnerability linked to a limited resource base, and also the strong dependent relation with the state and its diverse public policies in the region. Using semi-structured interviews with the community members, public-sector officers and academics, and also field observations, this complex local scenario is analysed with a view to understanding the threats that exist for Mapuche livelihoods and the assets that they can mobilize to counter these threats. The paper concludes that physical, natural and financial assets are severely limited and remain the reasons why there is heavy dependency on state resources to maintain these subsistence livelihoods. Traditional knowledge is losing ground against increasingly transcultural influences and practices, while endemic biodiversity is being replaced with monoculture. Consequently, community members (human capital) in particular, the younger generations are leaving the community to seek more viable livelihood options, mostly in urban areas. These factors point to the limitations of these local livelihoods based on dependent small-scale subsistence farming continuing in their current form. This situation poses a serious challenge for Mapuche rural communities and their traditional practices, and also for the Chilean state and the relationship between the two.","[Parraguez Vergara, Elvis; Barton, Jonathan R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Terr, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Vergara, EP (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Terr, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",jbarton@uc.cl,"Barton, Jonathan/E-8512-2011","Barton, Jonathan/0000-0001-6250-8684",,,,,58,14,17,0,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

This question is especially relevant in situations with low potential punishment for disobeying an obligation, i.e., with expressive law. To explore this issue, we present experimental evidence on how expressive law affects behavior if the law defines asymmetric obligations for ex ante identical individuals. To implement expressive law we introduce very weakly incentivized obligations, i.e., minimum contribution levels, in a repeated public goods experiment. Our main finding is that, in an environment with asymmetric obligations, people adhere to their individual obligation to the same extent as in an environment with symmetric obligations. This result is compatible with the argument that expressive law affects behavior by attaching an emotional cost of disobeying the own obligation such as a loss in self-esteem. We only find a significant temporary effect of obligations that vanishes in the long run. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We combine this literature with the emerging field of positive constitutional economics, which deals with the economic effects of constitutional rules. The paper addresses three questions: (1) Do budget provisions that are explicitly spelled out in a country's constitution have any significant effect on fiscal policy? (2) Does the transparency, or lack thereof, of the budget process have any significant effect on fiscal policy? and (3) Do these two variables have an impact on other variables such as government effectiveness and productivity? We find that constitutionally entrenched spending limits are correlated with lower total government expenditure and that the transparency of a nation's budget is correlated with higher government effectiveness as well as lower corruption. If anything, the deficit limits entrenched in the Maastricht Treaty are correlated with higher, rather than lower, overall government expenditure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This article reviews a number of depletion measures that have been recently brought forward in the context of environmental accounting ('practice') and green accounting ('theory'): depletion as change in total wealth; depletion as 'using up' of the resource; depletion as net savings; or, depletion as net investment. The differences in assumptions between these measures are clarified by contrasting their approaches with the classic theory of a firm engaged in extraction. All measures are evaluated using a time series of data on Dutch natural gas reserves. Our main findings are that correcting for the cost of depletion would lead to significant adjustments of both level and growth rates of Dutch net national income, with a strong dependency on the chosen measure.We counter criticism that accounting in practice would necessarily underestimate depletion. The choice for a depletion measure should be determined by the context of use: measurement of social welfare or sustainable income. The physical measure put forward in the SEEA Central Framework can be justified by its consistency with the income concept that underlies the SNA.","[Edens, Bram] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, The Hague, Netherlands; [Edens, Bram] Stat Netherlands, Natl Accounts Dept, NL-2495 JP The Hague, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Edens, B (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, The Hague, Netherlands.",b.edens@cbs.nl,,,,,,,30,6,6,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

There are a number of potential ways in which a foreclosed property might increase the payoffs to committing crime and decrease the likelihood of being caught, including reduced maintenance, residential turnover, and vacancy. Using point-specific, longitudinal crime, foreclosure, and other, property data from New York City, this paper determines whether foreclosed properties affect criminal activity on the surrounding blockface - an individual street segment including properties on both sides of the street. We find that additional foreclosures on a blockface lead to additional total crimes, violent crimes and public order crimes. These effects appear to be largest when foreclosure activity is measured by the number of foreclosed properties that are on their way to an auction or have reverted to bank ownership. We find that effects are largest in neighborhoods with moderate or high levels of crime, and on blockfaces with concentrated foreclosure activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We conclude by discussing some of the wide-ranging implications of a science policy that is re-engineering higher education in Canada.","[Guppy, Neil; Grabb, Edward; Mollica, Clayton] Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Guppy, N (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,"guppy, neil/KDM-4939-2024",,,,,,54,5,6,0,11,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We analyze 1405 ADR firms and their corresponding matched firms from 39 different countries and document that ADR firms have significantly higher cash holdings relative to their non-cross-listed peers, especially in recent years. The increase in cash holdings is much higher for emerging market firms because of their transition from particularly poor home country investor protection and accounting standards before cross-listing to much higher standards after cross-listing. In addition, firms with level III ADR listing, which represents the strongest investor protection, have higher cash holdings relative to other types of ADR firms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This has been attributed to the relative macro stability of this period and greater market efficiency. Using a panel of forecasts for 3-month interest rates for ten countries we test separately for EHTS and rational expectations. Assuming rational expectations holds we find support for the EHTS is illusory due to an off-setting time-varying term premia and non-rational expectations. Previous forecast-based studies suggest biased expectations tend to reinforce the effect of a time varying term premium. This change can be understood in the context of Fama's (2006) argument that markets tend to underestimate future spot rates during periods of long-run increases and overestimate during declines.

It is found that an improvement in transportation infrastructure that reduces trade costs on goods increases growth and decreases income gap at the expense of increasing industrial agglomeration between cities. Therefore, this paper confirms the existence of a trade-off between spatial equity (more even spatial distribution of economic activities) and spatial efficiency (higher growth rate). However, for knowledge infrastructure that reduces trade costs on ideas, it is found that it increases growth but also decreases income gap and industrial agglomeration simultaneously.

The results also yield evidence of herding behavior under the crash regime for all of the markets except Qatar which herds under the high volatility regime. The findings of the cross-GCC herding model also demonstrate herding comovements and not spillovers and are also robust to the cross-GCC volatility shocks.

Using a broad-based index of corporate governance quality, we find that well governed firms do not outperform poorly governed firms. We explore three potential explanations for the lack of significant impact of corporate governance quality on performance. First, we examine whether cross-country differences in institutional development have an impact on the effect of corporate governance on performance. Second, we investigate whether a narrowing down of the informationally efficient segment of the stock markets during the crisis can explain the results. We do not find support for either of these conjectures. Finally, we examine whether stock markets generally became less efficient in incorporating firm-specific information into stock prices during the crisis. Our empirical evidence is consistent with the latter view that during the crisis stock markets in developed countries became less efficient in incorporating firm-specific information into prices.

While trust is widely recognized as a strong determinant of cooperation, empirical evidence is less clear on power: severe fines may lead towards compliance or even have the opposite effect. We propose a thorough investigation of the nature of power (coercive versus legitimate) within the theoretical framework of tax compliance to shed light on the ambiguous results and to clarify the complex relation between power and trust. We use structural equation modeling to test the assumptions of the Slippery Slope Framework by taking into account coercive power and legitimate power on a sample of N = 389 self-employed Italian taxpayers and entrepreneurs. We found evidence that trust is positively related to voluntary tax compliance. Trust was found to be negatively related to coercive power and positively related to legitimate power. Both coercive power and legitimate power were correlated with enforced compliance. However, the effect of enforced compliance leads to increased evasion. The results evidence the multifaceted nature of power and trust and their relation with tax compliance, and the importance of power and trust in political regulatory strategies.

However, both Shane and other scholars who have made the same argument only offer broad-brush proposals to achieve this objective. The aim of this article, in contrast, is to engage in a detailed discussion of how to create appropriate policies for high-growth firms (HGFs). Drawing on research in Scotland, we argue that policy-makers are looking for HGFs in the wrong places. The heterogeneous nature of HGFs in terms of sector, age, size and origins makes in impractical to target support on particular sectors, technologies or types of firms (e.g., new or R&D intensive). The article proposes a reorientation of HGFs, both in terms of appropriate targeting and forms of support. Public policy also needs to focus on the retention of HGFs which are acquired by non-local businesses. Finally, policy-makers need to properly reflect upon the specificities of their entrepreneurial environment when devising appropriate policy interventions.","[Mason, Colin] Strathclyde Business Sch, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow G4 OQU, Lanark, Scotland; [Brown, Ross] Scottish Enterprise, Atrium Court, Glasgow G2 6HQ, Lanark, Scotland",,"Mason, C (通讯作者)，Strathclyde Business Sch, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, 199 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 OQU, Lanark, Scotland.",colin.mason@strath.ac.uk; Ross.Brown@scotent.co.uk,,"Brown, Ross/0000-0002-6164-7639",,,,,86,282,320,4,177,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We propose that longevity beliefs are responses constructed at the time of judgment, subject to irrelevant task and context factors, and leading to predictable biases. Specifically, we examine whether life expectancy is affected by the framing of expectations questions as either live-to or die-by, as well as by factors that actually affect longevity such as age, gender, and self-reported health. We find that individuals in a live-to frame report significantly higher chances of being alive at ages 55 through 95 than people in a corresponding die-by frame. Estimated mean life expectancies across three studies and 2300 respondents were 7.38 to 9.17 years longer when solicited in a live-to frame. We are additionally able to show how this framing works on a process level and how it affects preference for life annuities.

Preferred stock plus warrants reduces opportunistic participation by banks that do not require recapitalization, although conditional implementation limits free riding by banks that benefit from lower credit risk because of other banks participation. Efficient recapitalization is profitable if the benefits of lower aggregate credit risk exceed the cost of implicit transfers to bank debt holders.","[Philippon, Thomas; Schnabl, Philipp] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Philippon, Thomas; Schnabl, Philipp] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Philippon, T (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,54,74,88,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

We are particularly interested in analyzing whether the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector have experienced negative effects on their survival probability and employment growth over time. Our results do not suggest that higher trade exposure affects negatively the SMEs performance. To better identify these effects, we exploit differences in trade flows across manufacturing industries. We find that SMEs are more likely to survive in industries with higher exposure to international trade. In terms of employment growth, we do not find that SMEs are more negatively affected by higher international competition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We extend the DCE approach by asking farmers not only to choose among alternative conservation contracts but also to choose the land area they would put under contract. This extended approach allows us to formulate optimal contracts (in terms of management prescriptions and payment levels) taking explicitly account of the effect of contract design and farm characteristics on the participation area. We use a multinomial Heckman model. In its first stage, we estimate the probabilities of specific contract types being chosen and the corresponding marginal willingness to accept (WTA) figure. In the second stage, we identify the factors affecting the land area offered under contract by means of an OLS regression which takes account of the sample selection bias from first-stage choices. Based upon the estimates from both stages, contracts for a hypothetical conservation scheme are optimized such that environmental benefit is maximized given alternative program budgets. The results show that the optimal design of conservation contracts is sensitive to the program budget.","[Breustedt, Gunnar; Schulz, Norbert; Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Kiel; University of Western Australia,"Breustedt, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",gbreustedt@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,,"Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe/0000-0002-9936-2460",,,,,20,6,6,0,17,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

However, the reclassified eight electronic-related industries reveal presentation framings with uncertainty prospects. The heterogeneity of the high-technology industry thus leaves investors less tendency to hold these stocks and in turn a negative price effect.

In this context, we find it essential to examine how industrial agglomerations have evolved over time and in what manner major changes have influenced agglomeration landscape in catching-up regions of central and eastern countries (CEECs) in Europe, finally our study presenting clear evidence from Romania and Hungary. In what manner has industrial agglomeration frame changed in transition economies? Has relocation of economic activities taken place? What are the main driving forces behind the development of industrial agglomerations? These are a few critical questions that we attempt to answer through the present study. Transition economies are considerably intriguing for investigation as they endured some decades long economic development period which was underlined by socialist industrialization. Hence, our analysis can be perceived as a significant addition to knowledge about agglomeration in the non-Western countries in general, and in catching-up regions in particular. Choosing to confine our attention to several individual industries in 15 regions at NUTS2 level, this paper aims to examine the transformations suffered by industrial agglomeration landscape in the last years across Romania compared with Hungary. Finally, this analysis allows us to trace the manner in which the effects of transition period affected the emergence of industrial agglomerations in these two ex-socialist neighboring countries.","[Dirzu, Madalina-Stefania] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ctr European Studies, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,dirzu_madalina@yahoo.com; gabriela.susanu@gmail.com; alexasavoaei@yahoo.com; grecuroxanamaria@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,686,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200068,0

Using the second National Family Health Survey, the results of a multilevel probit model show that the correlation between mothers' employment and their children's schooling is negative. Women in poorer households are more likely to work but, given the negative correlation, their additional income does not seem sufficient to enable children's school attendance.

However, the studies on the impact of ICT on the public sector have not received much attention. No comprehensive and revised analysis of the impact of ICT on public sector has been performed. In order to address this gap, the present study focuses on the impact of ICT on the public sector. The study provides an in-depth analysis of literature on the impact of ICT on the public sector based on four domains (capabilities, interactions, orientations, and value distribution). The fifth domain of impact is proposed. The article will elaborate upon the benefits of ICT such as efficiency, effectiveness, and innovations. The research paper will enable the academic community to understand the importance of ICT for the public sector and extends the relevant literature.

Many economists have therefore examined the possible ways of calculating the cost of capital. There still doesn't exist consensus among experts but in developed markets the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is commonly used for valuation of assets and for creating the optimal portfolio. It is the mathematical model that explains a relationship between risk and return of particular securities. This model was created parallel and independent during the period 1964 - 1966 by authors W. F. Sharpe, J. Lintner and J. Mossin. However foundations of this model were developed by H. Markowitz and J. Tobin in the early 50's of 20th century. The basic idea is an assumption that expected yield (or loss) of an investment is proportional to the risk (coefficient Beta) of particular investment. CAPM therefore clarifies the relationship between expected return and Beta; and allows the investor to create optimal portfolio that eliminates the risk of investment. This paper deals with the Capital Asset Pricing Model, describes its advantages and also drawbacks.","[Gavlakova, Petra; Gregova, Elena] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,,petra.gavlakova@fpedas.uniza.sk; elena.gregova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Nemcekova, Petra/A-6043-2016; Gregova, Elena/P-1820-2015","Gregova, Elena/0000-0002-4296-4962",,,,,12,6,6,0,8,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,428,437,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100044,0

In particular, the paper studies the optimal response of the nominal exchange rate following a terms-of-trade shock. The paper departs from the New Keynesian (NK) literature in that it explicitly models internationally traded commodities as intermediate inputs in the production of local final goods and assume that the small open economy takes this price as given. This modification is not only in line with the long standing tradition of small open economy models, but also changes the optimal movements in the exchange rate. In contrast with the recent Small Open Economy NK literature, the model in this paper is able to reproduce the comovement between the nominal exchange rate and the price of exports, as it has been documented in the commodity currencies literature. Although the paper shows that there are preferences for which price stability is optimal even without flexible fiscal instruments, the model suggests that more attention should be given to the coordination between monetary and fiscal policy (taxes) in small open economies that are heavily dependent on exports of commodities. The model the paper proposes is a useful framework to study fear of floating.

We hypothesize that foreign investors who provide effective monitoring may affect corporate policy through pushing for a greater proportion of outsiders or foreigners on the board of directors who are less affiliated with controlling shareholders. Using the unique features of foreign ownership in Korea, we find that firms with an increase in foreign ownership are more likely to increase the fraction of outsiders and foreign directors on the board in the subsequent year. Increased board independence in response to a pressure from foreign investors results in a significant change in payout and investment policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Organizations invest in information technology for many reasons, for example cutting costs, increase in production and services without increasing costs, improving the quality of services or products (Lederer et al., 1998). However, in spite of these innovations, some organizations seem to struggle with alignment issues between IT and business departments resulting in an ambiguous and sometimes negative perception of IT services.

Our research is focused on the set up the importance of CSFs taken into account and also into setting up of the main groups of CSFs needed to be analyzed as a base for BA success. We were to find the general group of CSFs which need to be analyzed deeply in order to find the detailed factors influencing the BA. The main purpose of the CSFs fulfillment is besides the achievement of BA success also to find the most effective and efficient way to perform BA and to prepare the set of business requirements which need to be implemented into the information system. There were two research methods chosen to fulfill the goal of this paper. At first we performed the secondary research from the academic and business journals and magazines, as well as from the relevant scientific books. We have searched mainly the information related to CSFs and their relationships with business analysis. After that the induction was used to define the final set of used CFSs and also to split them into the pre-defined groups.

This paper examines the interlinked nature of land, employment and rural livelihoods within contemporary South Africa, in order to examine aspects of how the rural poor survive. Drawing on a body of livelihood and poverty-oriented enquiry, several vignettes from South Africa's former homeland communal areas are presented and discussed. Contemporary rural livelihoods are not only located in migratory networks and diverse livelihood activities, they are considered here as constituted in terms of four broad domains. First, they are forged within various land-based and agrarian activities. Second, they are often supported by small-scale, informal economic activities, both farm and non-farm. Third, they are frequently shaped by South Africa's comparatively well-developed system of state cash transfers and, fourth, they are patterned by culturally inscribed patterns of mutuality and social reciprocity. The complexity and vulnerability that typically characterize rural lives are examined in terms of these four domains, along with constellations of social differentiation with which they are intertwined.","[Neves, David; du Toit, Andries] Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies PLAAS, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Neves, D (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies PLAAS, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",dneves@uwc.ac.za,,"du Toit, Andries/0000-0001-5845-0774",,,,,100,77,98,0,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Using unique cross-sectional survey data of Japanese SMEs, we conduct a deep investigation into the substitutability between bank loans and trade credit. This survey contains rich information on the suppliers of trade credit to SMEs, thus enabling the examination of the channel through which credit is provided from suppliers to customers. We find that SMEs with little access to bank credit depend more on large suppliers for trade credit. We also find that when a purchase is made from a large supplier, more credit is indeed provided in the form of trade credit. Furthermore, this channel of credit from large suppliers to SMEs is only observed for solvent customers, not for insolvent customers. Our findings suggest that trade credit plays an important role for entrepreneurial firms over the financial growth cycle. For young and small firms with little access to bank loans trade credit is an important funding source.","[Ogawa, Kazuo] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Sterken, Elmer] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Tokutsu, Ichiro] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Osaka University; University of Groningen; Kobe University,"Ogawa, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Osaka 5670047, Japan.",ogawa@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Sterken, Elmer/0000-0002-5785-5152",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330068] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,34,31,36,0,67,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We suppose that stock prices have both permanent and transitory components. The discrete time representation of the beta depends on the sampling interval and two components labeled permanent and transitory betas. We show that if no transitory component is present in stock prices then no sampling interval effect occurs. However, the presence of a transitory component implies that the beta is an increasing (decreasing) function of the sampling interval for more (less) risky assets. In our framework, assets are labeled risky if their permanent beta is greater than their transitory beta and vice versa for less risky assets. Simulations show that our theoretical results provide good approximations for the estimated betas in small samples. We provide empirical evidence about the presence of negative serial correlation and mean reversion in the returns of the portfolios considered. We discuss why our model is better able to provide an explanation for this sampling interval effect than other models in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The latter finding suggests that these at limit districts were not constrained by tax limits, either because the desired spending levels were exactly at limit, or because the limits were no longer binding after the districts utilized other non-property tax revenues such as stale aid, especially from the supplemental Hurd aid program.","[Phuong Nguyen-Hoang] Univ Iowa, Publ Policy Ctr, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Nguyen-Hoang, P (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Publ Policy Ctr, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",phuong-nguyen@uiowa.edu,"Nguyen-Hoang, Phuong/E-1960-2011","Nguyen-Hoang, Phuong/0000-0001-8960-7199",,,,,89,12,16,0,8,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Colonial India under the British rule acquired the characteristics of an open economy with free trade and thereby remained exposed to global market forces and as such experienced cyclical fluctuations. There exists a scanty literature on business cycles relating to colonial India though there is a growing literature on the issue for independent India. Possibly, the only available literature for colonial India is Thorpe & Thorpe (1926), which contended that colonial India followed European pattern of cycles during the period 1889-1920. There is no other literature that examines whether the output of the Indian economy was synchronized with other economies. Present study seeks to bridge this gap in literature. We found that colonial India's economy got influenced by several West European economies as also the USA and Japan. Further, in pooled estimation, we find a weaker but significant positive trend of synchronisation of India's business cycle with several West European countries. Besides, colonial India's business cycle is also found to be weakly synchronized with the US and Japanese economy. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The challenges of administrative process are associated to Professionalism, which has become a fundamental prerequisite for Organisations to succeed, and be competitive. Some Organisations are aware of the administrative challenges, and others are not. Even those Organisations that are aware of the challenges do not seem to understand the gravity and depth of the impact it has on their growth and competitiveness.

Results uncovers that VIX is significantly attributed toward the macroeconomic indicators. We find that India VIX is more responsive to the GDP and employment rate. We also find that VIX rises significantly prior to the scheduled announcement and remains more normal on the new releases. The fed's monetary policy also plays great role in determining the portfolio selection.

The study uses an interpretive content-based analysis of social and environmental disclosures made by companies, to investigate stakeholder salience. From a theoretical perspective, this paper is framed by two largely overlapping theories: stakeholder theory and stakeholder salience theory. Stakeholder theory is of particular use in providing a basic guidance to understand that companies try to refer to several stakeholder views when deciding what information to disclose. The paper draws largely on the stakeholder salience framework, which is seen as a skeletal theory that is fleshed out by an exploration of the stakeholder salience dimensions as shown in the companies' sustainability reports. The results provide evidence for the existence of a relationship between stakeholder salience, the amount of attributes possessed and the type of attributes held by the stakeholder. In particular, we find that many of the claims posed by definitive and dominant stakeholders are addressed by means of corporate sustainability reporting. Results also show that, on average, the stakeholders who possess power score highest on salience, followed by those who possess legitimacy, and only then by those who possess urgency.","[Staicu, Anca-Monica] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Accounting Audit Financial & Econ Anal & Manageme, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,staicuancutza@yahoo.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,19,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1219,1231,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100130,0

Changes in a concept of perceiving a welfare state are reflected in concepts of particular welfare states of developed European countries. It is apparent that the national economies' capacity to fund extensive social programs is limited, and that it is necessary to shift the boundary between the state's and individuals' (clients) responsibilities.

However, as business environments and IS/IT applications are rapidly growing in complexity, undertaking SISP process is getting difficult. In order to undertake SISP, organisations need to take multiple planning perspectives, including managerial, environmental and organisational factors simultaneously, not deal with only an important one. Thus, to diminish the issues and undertake an effective SISP process, various drivers both, inside and outside of the organisation, need to be considered and identified. If organisations consider possible drivers effectively, they will be more likely to realize business goals and strategies as well as improve organisational performance. This paper proposes five key drivers positively affecting effective SISP process. Also, the paper proposes a model to show relationship between the key drivers and SISP success. Further research is first planned to undertake three case studies of Korean large organisations as a part of mixed methods approach to validate the identified drivers; to find other potential drivers that could vitally influence effective SISP process; and to identify the relationship between key drivers and SISP success.","[Yang, Jungho; Pita, Zijad; Singh, Mohini] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),,jungho.yang@rmit.edu.au; zijad.pita@rmit.edu.au; mohini.singh@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,455,465,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100047,0

We find that countries where the supervisor is the central bank, or where it is independent of government, have more conservatively regulated financial systems. Nonperforming loans are lower in countries where the supervisor is independent, while capital ratios are higher where the central bank, rather than another agency of government, is the lead supervisor. At the same time, some measures of bank credit to the economy are significantly lower both where the supervisor is independent and where the lead supervisor is the central bank. Insofar as the same institutional arrangements that confer greater stability, such as higher capital ratios and lower nonperforming loans, also limit the provision of credit to the economy, countries face a tradeoff. That different countries have been moving in different directions in restructuring their supervisory arrangements should not be surprising insofar as they have different objectives for their financial sector.","[Dincer, N.

Testing the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) over 76 stock indices using 17 best established indicators (e.g. runs test), we show that most indices exhibit some type(s) of anomaly and that indicators differ from each other in terms of statistical power and/or the type of anomaly detected. A principal components analysis (PCA) demonstrates that indicators group along orthogonal dimensions, and hence a market can exhibit short-term memory, long-term memory and/or calendar effects, which are all distinct sources of possible inefficiency. This research presents statistical evidence on the extent and nature of market inefficiency, offers possible explanations for conflicting previous findings, and provides new insights into studying market efficiency.

We argue that autocratic rulers adopt constitutions in the nascent stages of an autocratic coalition taking power, when uncertainty about leader intentions is high. Constitutions can serve to consolidate a new distribution of power, allowing a launching organization (LO) to codify and defend their rights. Autocratic coalitions that adopt constitutions should therefore last longer in power than those that do not. Using new data compiled on constitutions created under autocracy in Latin America from 1950 to 2002, we show that autocratic coalitions who adopt and operate under constitutions extend their survival. This result holds after controlling for the presence of other autocratic institutions, country fixed effects, and after using an instrumental variables strategy to address reverse causation. A case study of Mexico details the mechanism by which this relationship between constitutions and stability occurs.","[Menaldo, Victor] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Albertus, Michael] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Chicago,"Menaldo, V (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",vmenaldo@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,35,33,48,0,32,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

However, the effects have been extremely different from one country to another and from one economic sector to another. Starting from the economic assumptions formulated in the field's literature, the article analyzes the hypotheses of the disadvantageous influences of the services and financial sector upon the volatility of the economic growth rate and the unemployment rate in times of crisis. Econometric estimations using cross-sectional OLS Robust (White) Regressions on a sample of worldwide data taken from the World Bank confirm the theoretical hypotheses. The consequences of the highlighted mechanisms can be significant through the repositioning of the role of the different economic sectors.","[Dragos, Cristian; Dragos, Simona Laura] BABES BOLYAI Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Dragos, C (通讯作者)，BABES BOLYAI Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristian.dragos@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Dragos, Cristian/IAO-9689-2023; Dragos, Simona Laura/B-4689-2016","Dragos, Simona Laura/0000-0002-3037-3401",,,,,29,6,6,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2012,14.0,,,,6,,621,634,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,038UI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311199200004,0

The paper introduces a comprehensive measure of systematic risk (SR) for individual hedge funds by breaking up total risk into systematic and fund-specific or residual risk components. Contrary to the popular understanding that hedge funds are market neutral, we find that systematic risk is a highly significant factor explaining the dispersion of cross-sectional returns while at the same time measures of residual risk and tail risk seem to have little explanatory power. Funds in the highest SR quintile generate 6% more average annual returns compared with funds in the lowest SR quintile. After controlling for a large set of fund characteristics and risk factors, systematic risk remains positive and highly significant, whereas the relation between residual risk and future fund returns continues to be insignificant. Hence, systematic risk is a powerful determinant of the cross-sectional differences in hedge fund returns. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the moderating influences of perceptions of environmental uncertainty and venture growth aspirations are also examined. Findings from an analysis of data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) I indicate that an entrepreneur's risk-taking propensity has no relationship to the likelihood of successfully starting a business. Perceptions of environmental uncertainty and venture growth aspirations were positively related to non-strategic risk-taking propensity, yet none of these variables (strategic and non-strategic risk-taking propensity, environmental uncertainty and growth aspirations) had a significant effect on venture creation success. We suggest that risk-taking propensity, as measured in this study, does not play a significant role in differentiating between nascent entrepreneurs or others, or between those that are successful or unsuccessful at starting businesses.","[Gartner, William] Clemson Univ, Coll Business & Behav Sci, Spiro Inst Entrepreneurial Leadership, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Liao, Jianwen] IIT, Stuart Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60616 USA",Clemson University; Illinois Institute of Technology,"Gartner, W (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Coll Business & Behav Sci, Spiro Inst Entrepreneurial Leadership, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",gartner@clemson.edu; liao@iit.edu,,,,,,,32,29,38,3,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The paper contrasts microfinance's early days' initially refreshing and encouraging promises of a development initiative that empowers people to help themselves while paying for itself with a more gloomy picture that derives from the synthesis results of our systematic review. It presents two simple models that show the pathways from microfinance to increased investment in improved health and education, contrasting theory with our synthesis results. Our discussion highlights that thinking through microfinance makes it necessary to thoroughly investigate both the theory behind interventions and the evidence for their impact. It raises the essential question: Is microfinance about providing banking services to the unbanked, or is microfinance a development intervention that concerns itself with the attainment of long-term sustainable responses to high levels of poverty?","[Korth, M.] Univ Johannesburg, Ctr Anthropol Res, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Stewart, R.] Univ London, Inst Educ, Social Sci Res Unit, EPPI Ctr, London WC1E 7HU, England; [van Rooyen, C.; de Wet, T.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Anthropol & Dev Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; University of Johannesburg,"Korth, M (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Ctr Anthropol Res, Johannesburg, South Africa.",mkorth@uj.ac.za,"van Rooyen, Carina/AAF-6933-2020","van Rooyen, Carina/0000-0003-1167-4193",,,,,29,8,13,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Using a sample of Taiwanese publicly listed companies from 1997 to 2009, this study shows that the relationship between excess control rights and cash holdings depends on each firm's characteristics in terms of quantile regression. Fewer excess control rights affect cash holdings positively in low cash holding firms but negatively in high cash holding firms. Additional analysis reveals that when a family member serves as the CEO in low cash holding firms, the amount of cash holding is greater than if the CEO is an outsider. However, family members holding the position of CEO affect cash holdings negatively in high cash holding firms. These results suggest that firms with less cash holdings stockpile more cash reserves to take advantage of investment opportunities. The objective of corporate governance for firms with more cash reserves is to ensure that firms decrease levels of cash to avoid agency problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In principle the community forestry programme is designed to address both environmental quality and poverty alleviation. However, concern has been expressed that forest policies emphasise environmental conservation, and that this has a detrimental impact on the use of community forests in rural Nepal where households require access to public forest products to sustain livelihoods. To study the effect of government policies on forest use, an economic model of a typical small community of economically heterogeneous households in Nepal was developed. The model incorporates a link between private agriculture and public forest resources, and uses this link to assess the socioeconomic impacts of forest policies on the use of public forests. Socioeconomic impacts were measured in terms of household income, employment and income inequality. The results show that some forest policies have a negative economic impact, and the impacts are more serious than those reported by other studies. This study shows that existing forest policies reduce household income and employment, and widen income inequalities within communities, compared to alternative policies. Certain forest policies even constrain the poorest households' ability to meet survival needs. The findings indicate that the socioeconomic impacts of public forest policies may be underestimated in developing countries unless household economic heterogeneity and forestry's contribution to production are accounted for. The study also demonstrates that alternative policies for managing common property resources would reduce income inequalities in rural Nepalese communities and lift incomes and employment to a level where even the poorest households could meet their basic needs.","[Dhakal, Bhubaneswor; Bigsby, Hugh; Cullen, Ross] Lincoln Univ, Fac Commerce, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Dhakal, B (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Fac Commerce, POB 84, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand.",Bhubaneswordhakal@gmail.com; Hugh.Bigsby@lincoln.ac.nz; Ross.cullen@lincoln.ac.nz,"Cullen, Ross/K-6370-2019; Dhakal, Bhubaneswor/AAO-7566-2021; Bigsby, Hugh/G-2582-2018","Dhakal, Bhubaneswor/0000-0001-5620-1977; Bigsby, Hugh/0000-0002-7841-8971",,,,,43,8,8,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Prior to the adoption of these programs, the house, which represents the most important non-pension asset to the elderly, was exempt from determining Medicaid eligibility and served as both a place of residence and a store of wealth. Adoption of estate recovery programs changed the owner-occupied housing safety net by making the house eligible for recovery by the government, which increased the implicit tax of holding owner-occupied housing. Using data from 1993 to 2004 in the Health and Retirement Study on elderly individuals, I find that state adoption of estate recovery programs makes the elderly decrease homeownership by 4.6%, decrease home equity by 15%, and also decrease the housing share of the elderly wealth portfolio.

The possibility of a de jure anchor",REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE,,,French,Editorial Material,,,,,,European Union; Euro area; Exchange rate regime; de jure anchor; Structural VAR model,,"With the recent tensions within the euro area, the Swiss franc appreciated sharply against the euro, playing the role of international safe-haven currency. Although Switzerland is not a member of the European Union (EU), its high degree of de facto integration to it make that such appreciation is transmitted to the real economy. Thus, if the independence and autonomy of Switzerland's official currency in Europe has advantages, it also entails significant costs, particularly related to the special status of the Swiss franc. In this article we study the desirability and viability for Switzerland of a median monetary integration to the EU to help ease the external constraint of the exchange rate, namely a de jure anchor of the Swiss franc on the euro. To answer this question, we focus on the origins of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Swiss franc with a structural VAR model. Our results show that Switzerland would not have interest in adopting a hard peg with the euro. If the choice of such monetary regime may reduce the Swiss franc/euro volatility in the short-term, it would be accompanied in the medium term by significant sunk costs.","[Guillaumin, Cyriac; Vallet, Guillaume] Univ Grenoble, CREG, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Vallet, G (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble, CREG, 1241 Rue Residences,Domaine Univ,BP 47, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France.",cyriac.guillaumin@upmf-grenoble.fr; guillaume.vallet@upmf-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,14,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The systemic risk measure, defined as the insurance cost to protect against distressed losses in a banking system, is a summary indicator of market perceived risk that reflects expected default risk of individual banks, risk premia as well as correlated defaults. An application of our methodology to a portfolio of twenty-two major banks in Asia and the Pacific illustrates the dynamics of the spillover effects of the global financial crisis to the region. The increase in the perceived systemic risk, particularly after the failure of Lehman Brothers, was mainly driven by the heightened risk aversion and the squeezed liquidity. Further analysis, which is based on our proposed approach to quantifying the marginal contribution of individual banks to the systemic risk, suggests that too-big-to-fail is a valid concern from a macro-prudential perspective of bank regulation.

We find that the latter specification dominates the former in terms of predictive ability for the extremely low interest rate regime (the period between 1999 and 2006) because under the former the semielasticity is excessively sensitive to slight changes in interest rates.

A system estimation approach is employed to control for the simultaneity between NIM and NII for commercial banks in a group of 28 financially liberalized countries during the period between 1997 and 2004. We find a statistically significant negative relationship between NIM and Nil for the period between 1997 and 2002. A generally positive but statistically insignificant association between NIM and NII is found for the subsequent period (2003-2004). Banks' increasing involvement in non-traditional activities is negatively correlated with risk-adjusted profitability measures in the former subperiod, suggesting no obvious diversification benefits. However, the share of noninterest income is positively related to the return on assets (ROA) and the return on equity (ROE) for the latter subsample. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Model of natural gas markets is based on long-term, point-to-point commercial capacity rights (MDQ(XY)) that reflect the physical capacity of the pipeline and are traded frequently among system users (shippers) in markets independent of the transmission system operator (TSO). When physical capacity is complex and scarce and the gas market is dynamic there are many MDQ(XY) that must be continually reallocated and reconfigured, making trading difficult/illiquid and market outcomes suboptimal. Entry and exit capacities defined separately for a few large zones make trading easy and liquid but operationally problematic. Shipper-only trading would result in such a large gap between market and optimal (or even just feasible) outcomes that the TSO must engage in active capacity and gas trading itself to offset unconstructive/dangerous shipper trades. These conclusions suggest that, at least in some/many complex situations, commercial capacity should be eliminated altogether and replaced with a TSO-operated on-the-day market that prices and allocates physical capacity directly, with financial hedging as an equivalent (or better) substitute for commercial capacity. A simplified version of such a market has been operating successfully in Victoria, Australia, since 1999.",,,"Ruff, LE (通讯作者)，8017 Oak Way, Windsor, CA 95492 USA.",larry.ruff@marketreform.com,,,,,,,3,7,8,1,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Our novel estimation approach is able to consistently estimate heterogeneous speeds of adjustment in different regimes as well as to properly test for the threshold effect. We consider several proxies for adjustment costs that affect the asymmetries in capital structure adjustments and find evidence that firms with large financing imbalance (or a deficit), large investment or low earnings volatility adjust faster than those with the opposite characteristics. Firms not only adjust at different rates but also seem to adjust toward heterogeneous leverage targets. Moreover, we document a consistent pattern that firms undertaking quick adjustment are over-levered with a financing deficit and rely heavily on equity issues to make such adjustment.

These have been difficult to rationalise and evidence on the sources of such profitability is inconclusive. We utilise a sample of optioned stocks, characterised by high liquidity, high market capitalisation and fewer short sales constraints and compare results with control samples of non optioned stocks chosen on the basis of market value, turnover and bid-ask spread. The sample characteristics, and the fact that derivatives improve the impounding of information into prices, enable us to draw conclusions about the causes of momentum profits.

This is also the case in Vickrey (1969) 'bottleneck model'. To date, the closest approximations of this ideal in practice have so-called 'step tolls', in which the toll takes on different values over discrete time intervals, but is constant within each interval. Given the prevalence of step-tolling schemes they have received surprisingly little attention in the literature. This paper compares two step-toll schemes that have been studied using the bottleneck model by Arnott et al. (1990) and Laih (1994). It also proposes a third scheme in which late in the rush hour drivers slow down or stop just before reaching a tolling point, and wait until the toll is lowered from one step to the next step. Such 'braking' behaviour has been observed in practice. Analytical derivations and numerical modelling show that the three tolling schemes have different optimal toll schedules and reduce total social costs by different percentages. These differences persist even in the limit as the number of steps approaches infinity. Braking lowers the welfare gain from tolling by 14% to 21% in the numerical example. Therefore, preventing or limiting braking seems important in designing step-toll systems. (C) Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[van den Berg, Vincent A.

This paper used an inter-temporal optimisation framework, which considered soil in a time-dependent resource extraction perspective. We have demonstrated that soil degradation is causing an enormous reduction in productive value of smallholder land in Malawi. Current user cost of soil quality among smallholder farmers, which represents annual loss in productive value of land, was estimated to be US$21 per hectare. Based on this value and land area under smallholder agriculture in Malawi, economic costs of soil degradation among smallholder farmers were estimated to amount to 14% of the agricultural GDP for Malawi. Although smallholder farmers' current practices are sub-optimal to Steady State solutions, they are above static solutions. This demonstrates that smallholder farmers have some private incentives to invest in the soil quality stock. Smallholder farmers internalise some of the dynamic costs of soil degradation under the current practices. However, a sensitivity analysis on a slightly higher discount rate indicates that SS solutions closely resemble the prevailing smallholder farming practices. This suggests that smallholder farmers may be overexploiting soil quality stock because they have a high time preference. That is, they value the current consumption more than their future consumption and wellbeing. High levels of poverty in Malawi and serious lack of viable alternatives to subsistence farming may be influencing such behaviour. Promoting more viable land use alternatives than subsistence farming and formuling policies that help transform smallholder agriculture into a profitable enterprise will not only increase the cost of degrading the soil, but also encourage farmers to invest in the soil quality stock.","[Nakhumwa, Teddie O.] British High Commiss, Dept Int Dev Aid DFID Malawi, UK Aid, Lilongwe 3, Malawi; [Hassan, Rashid M.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Nakhumwa, TO (通讯作者)，British High Commiss, Dept Int Dev Aid DFID Malawi, UK Aid, Off Convent Dr,Box 30042, Lilongwe 3, Malawi.",t-nakhumwa@dfid.gov.uk,"Hassan, Rashid/CAG-5246-2022",,,,,,49,8,10,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Classic treatments of trust emphasize its instrumental or consequential nature, proposing that people trust based on expectations that their trust will be honored and the size of reward if it is. Data from our labs, however, focusing on the trust or investment game, suggest that people trust even when their expectations of reward fall below their general tolerance for risk. Further data from our lab suggests that people trust not out of a concern for the consequences of their actions as much as for the actions themselves. The emotions people report feeling about trusting versus withholding trust predicts their decisions much more strongly than the emotions they attach to the potential outcomes. Social dynamics, such as whether participants have been assigned to a specific counterpart in the game, influence whether they trust, even though their economic expectations and payoffs remain unchanged.

The research method is based on a survey of 30 commercial companies from various fields of activity that have or have not implemented, at the leadership level, the concept of sustainable crediting. The data collecting and processing approach has resulted in the determination of the main economic-financial indicators for a period of 5 years, indicators used by banks in relation with the credited organizations. The main results show that companies that have implemented the sustainable crediting concept are more able to achieve sustainability in their developed activity, as well as organizational change with positive effects on their business and on the company as a whole. The concept of sustainable crediting implies the capitalization of the commercial companies, the increase of the loan portfolio quality, the achievement of the financial balance and environmental protection.","Spiru Haret Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Spiru Haret University,"Ilie, D (通讯作者)，Spiru Haret Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",dragosilie2002@yahoo.com,"Ilie, Dragos George/ABB-9153-2021",,,,,,14,1,1,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2012,14.0,32,,,,,393,403,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964ED,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305675600008,0

This paper addresses one important aspect of the linkage by empirically investigating the impact of the intervention of microfinance programs on the moneylender interest rates in northern Bangladesh, and finds that moneylender interest rates increase with microfinance program coverage. Higher microfinance program coverage increases moneylender interest rates in the villages in which more loans are invested in productive economic activities than consumption. Borrowers resort to moneylenders for additional funds probably because of inadequate supply, unavailability of seasonal working capital from MFIs, and tight repayment schedules, which in turn increase demand for moneylender loans.

We also find that PCON firms have a significantly (1) higher extent of leverage, (2) higher likelihood of reporting a loss, (3) higher likelihood of having negative equity, and (4) higher likelihood of being audited by a big audit firm. We suggest that PCON firms are charged higher interest rates by lenders as a result of efficient contracting given their higher inherent risks.

However, when the Poor is able to PI a different equilibrium may arise. We show that the ability of the Poor to allow PI might increase welfare in this country even if it is never implemented.

In particular, the spread delta computed from the Gaussian copula model assumes constant base correlations, whereas we show that the correlations are dynamic and correlated to the index spread. It might therefore be expected that a dynamic model of credit risk, which is able to capture the dependence between the base correlations and the index spread, will have better hedging performances. In this paper, we compare delta hedging of spread risk based on the Gaussian copula model, to the implementation of jump-to-default ratio computed from the dynamic local intensity model. Theoretical and empirical analysis are illustrated by using the market data in both before and after the subprime crisis. We observe that delta hedging of spread risk outperforms the implementation of jump-to-default ratio in the pre-crisis period associated with CDX.NA.IG series 5, and the two strategies have comparable performance for crisis period associated with CDX.NA.IG series 9 and 10. This shows that, although the local intensity model is a dynamic model, it is not sufficient to explain the joint dynamic of the index spread and the base correlations, and a richer dynamic model is required to obtain better hedging results. Moreover, although different specifications of the local intensity can be fitted to the market data equally well, their hedging results can be significant different. This reveals substantial model risk when hedging CDO tranches.","[Crepey, Stephane] Univ Evry Val Essonne, Lab Anal & Probabil, F-91025 Evry, France; [Cousin, Areski] Univ Lyon 1, ISFA, F-69366 Lyon 07, France; [Kan, Yu Hang] Columbia Univ, IEOR Dept, New York, NY USA",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Columbia University,"Crépey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val Essonne, Lab Anal & Probabil, F-91025 Evry, France.",areski.cousin@univ-lyon1.fr; stephane.crepey@univ-evry.fr; gabriel.kan@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,4,4,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Early on, Maori were denied access to fisheries by a lack of access to capital; a de facto restriction that became a de jure restriction with the creation of fishing quotas in the 1990s. This legal change allowed Maori to use their historic treaty claims to articulate with the discourse of property rights and gain legal access to fish. In return, this engagement facilitated the penetration of capitalism into Maori fishing practices. Two Maori-controlled fishing companies, Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd (AFL) and Moana Pacific Fisheries Ltd (Moana Pacific), demonstrate how Maori ownership of fishing quotas irrevocably changed historical modes of access and relationships to capital.","Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"De Alessi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",dealessi@washington.edu,,,,,,,89,39,42,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We find that foreign acquisitions lead to higher CEO compensation than domestic acquisitions. Overall, our findings suggest that CEOs have strong incentives to do foreign acquisitions rather than domestic acquisitions since they receive larger compensation following a foreign acquisition regardless of how poor firm performance is. Furthermore, we observe a positive and significant relation between CEO compensation and firm size during the pre-acquisition period for firms involved in foreign acquisitions, thus their CEOs would expect to increase their compensation package through foreign acquisitions. However, our results show that there is no significant link between firm size and CEO compensation during the pre-acquisition period for firms involved in domestic acquisitions.

The aims were to make it easier for claimants to claim benefits, to make the gains to work more transparent and to reduce the amount spent on administration and lost in fraud and error. More households will see entitlements rise from the move to Universal Credit considered in isolation than will see entitlements fall; in aggregate, entitlements will rise by nearly 1.1 pound billion a year. Low-income families will see their entitlements rise by more than high-income families, on average, and couples will gain more from the reform, on average, than single-adult families, especially if there are also children in the family. In general, those facing the weakest incentive to work at all, or the weakest incentive to increase earnings, see their incentives strengthened, including those with very low earnings and hours worked per week and those who at present experience simultaneous withdrawal of multiple means-tested benefits and tax credits. But a Council Tax Benefit that operates separately from Universal Credit, and that has rules that vary across English local authorities, could easily undermine many of the supposed advantages of Universal Credit.","[Brewer, Mike] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Brewer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",mbrewer@essex.ac.uk; james_browne@ifs.org.uk; wenchao_j@ifs.org.uk,,"Brewer, Mike/0000-0003-0759-0384; Jin, Wenchao/0000-0003-3855-6840",ESRC [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,8,15,15,1,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

In this paper, we estimate the effects of junk food availability on body mass index (BMI), obesity, and related outcomes among a national sample of fifth graders. Unlike previous studies, we address the endogeneity of the school food environment by controlling for children's BMI at school entry and estimating instrumental variables regressions that leverage variation in the school's grade span. Our main finding is that junk food availability does not significantly increase BMI or obesity among this fifth-grade cohort despite the increased likelihood of in-school junk food purchases. The results are robust to alternate measures of junk food availability including school administrator reports of sales during school hours, school administrator reports of competitive food outlets, and children's reports of junk food availability. Moreover, the absence of any effects on overall food consumption and physical activity further support the null findings for BMI and obesity.","[Datar, Ashlesha] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA; [Nicosia, Nancy] RAND Corp, Boston, MA 02116 USA",RAND Corporation; RAND Corporation,"Datar, A (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, 1776 Main St,POB 2138, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA.",,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD057193-04, R01 HD057193] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,50,41,51,3,62,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

In the model, monetary policy follows a nominal interest rate rule with a drifting inflation target, and agents have imperfect information about the persistent component of the inflation target. When the yield curve information is included, the DSGE model generates inflation expectations that are highly correlated with survey data evidence. In the DSGE model, agents quickly learn the inflation target and the gap between the perceived target and the actual target is quantitatively small. This is in contrast to some existing studies that suggest a persistent role of imperfect information even as long-run inflation expectations have declined and stabilized at a low level since the mid 1980s.","Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Doh, T (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO USA.",Taeyoung.Doh@kc.frb.org,"Doh, Taeyoung/HLP-6922-2023",,,,,,25,3,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

With 116 questions, the FAFSA is almost as long as IRS Form 1040 and substantially longer than Forms 1040EZ and 1040A. Aid for college is intended to increase college attendance by reducing its price and loosening liquidity constraints. Economic theory, empirical evidence, and common sense suggest that complexity in applying for aid could undermine its ability to affect schooling decisions. In 2006, Dynarski and Scott-Clayton published in this journal an analysis of complexity in the aid system that generated considerable discussion in academic and policy circles. Over the next few years, complexity in the aid system drew the attention of the media, advocacy groups, presidential candidates, the National Economic Council, and the Council of Economic Advisers. A flurry of legislative and agency activity followed. In this article, we provide a five-year retrospective of what has changed in the aid application process, what has not, and the possibilities for future reform.","[Dynarski, Susan] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dynarski, Susan] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dynarski, Susan] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Dynarski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",dynarski@umich.edu; mwieders@umich.edu,"Dynarski, Susan/GOP-1216-2022",,,,,,25,33,42,1,16,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Although the deterioration in youth employment opportunities has often been blamed for Japan's declining fertility rate, the effect of slack labor market conditions on fertility is theoretically unclear. We estimate the effects of regional labor market conditions at entry to the labor market and contemporaneous conditions on fertility, controlling for nation-wide year effects and prefecture fixed effects, and find the following. First, high school-educated women who experienced a recession while entering the labor market are less likely to have children. In contrast, a recession rather increases fertility among college-educated women. When summed up, the aggregate impact of labor market conditions experienced in youth on fertility is weak. Second, the unemployment rate at entry to the labor market is positively correlated with the probability of having two or more children conditionally on having at least one child. Third, the contemporaneous unemployment rate is negatively correlated with marriage of women in the local labor market, although the correlation is weak and concentrated on the less educated group.

Because these policy initiatives do not directly address the educational challenges experienced by disadvantaged students, they have contributed littleand are not likely to contribute much in the futureto raising overall student achievement or to reducing achievement and educational attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Moreover, such policies have the potential to do serious harm.

After controlling for restatement severity, I find that cooperation increases the likelihood of being sanctioned, perhaps because it improves the SEC's ability to build a successful case against the firm.

Thus, we applied a multidimensional analysis technique, namely Principal Component Analysis on two groups of companies in the manufacturing sector, during the period 2000-2011, also including the global financial crisis impact. The financial crisis is the main factor that influenced the economical and financial company's state, starting with 2008, and thus, it is the main discrimination factor with a strong impact on the company's financial condition.

Capital productivity or labor productivity could have caused reduction in economic growth because labor productivity growth might have caused workers to enjoy more leisure instead of working more or growth in capital productivity could have made capital more efficient and resulted in more idle capacity; thus causing depletion of output through reduction in the capital or labor used in production.

This paper presents the results of the comparison between the old and new rules of Parmalat corporate governance, highlighting the considerable differences in the composition and functions of the various company bodies. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the efficacy of the external and internal control systems is also provided. The main points of strength which make it possible to consider the new Parmalat as a model of best practice in Italy are identified, although critical aspects are also pointed out.

It is well established that educational attainments vary considerably between India's caste and religious groups with Muslims, Dalits (the Scheduled Castes), Adivasis (the Scheduled Tribes), and the 'Other Backward Classes' (the OBC) being the most backward. Using data from the Indian Human Development Survey of 2005 - which tested over 12,300 children, aged 8-11, for their ability to read, write, and do arithmetic at different levels of competence - this study examines inequalities within social groups in the test scores of children to argue that inter-group comparisons of educational attainment should take into account not just the mean level of achievement of the children in a group but, also, the degree of inequality in the distribution of achievements between children in the group. The article then proceeds to enquire why different children have different levels of educational achievement. The central conclusion is that, after controlling for a number of parental, household and school-related factors, children from all the different social groups, when compared to Brahmin children, were disadvantaged, in some or all of the three competencies of reading, arithmetic, and writing. However, this disadvantage was greatest for Muslim, Dalit, and Adivasi children. These children were disadvantaged with respect to all three competencies and their disadvantage embraced failure as well as success. Using a decomposition analysis, the article quantifies the 'structural advantage' that Brahmin and High Caste children enjoyed over their Dalit and Muslim counterparts.","Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Belfast BT37 0QB, Antrim, North Ireland",Ulster University,"Borooah, VK (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Belfast BT37 0QB, Antrim, North Ireland.",vk.borooah@ulster.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,40,43,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

Among the measures of private sector behavior we used the current account balance adjusted with the government balance, the financial account balance of the balance of payments, the final consumption expenditure of households and the evolution of the real economy. We find strong empirical evidence for the hypothesis that imbalances built up in the private sector would eventually spill over to the public sector under the form of government deficit and increased public debt. In the context of European integration we conclude that the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht convergence criteria would need to account for this relationship when determining critical threshold values for the macroeconomic variables.

In this review, we investigate how certain features of the tax code impact investors and asset markets. We begin by considering how tax heterogeneity across investors and across securities can lead to market segmentation and discuss the nature of equilibrium prices and allocations with tax clienteles. We then turn our attention to the optimal trading of assets when the tax on capital gains and losses is deferred until the asset is sold. In the absence of portfolio considerations, the optimal trading policies are driven entirely by the desire of investors to minimize the tax cost of owning assets. We next focus on an investor's lifetime portfolio choice problem with capital gains taxes and discuss how the investor's optimal trading decisions and portfolio choices are influenced by both tax and diversification motives. Our discussion includes consideration of nonfinancial income, tax-deferred investment opportunities, and multiple risky assets.","[Dammon, Robert M.; Spatt, Chester S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Dammon, RM (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",rd19@andrew.cmu.edu; cspatt@andrew.cmu.edu,,,,,,,38,4,6,1,37,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4804-5,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Inclusion of road tax among other taxes and past efforts of the European Commission suggest that there is an attempt to modernize and harmonize the traditional concept of taxation of road vehicles in the European Union member countries. In European Union member countries there are still considerable differences in approach and implementation of taxation of motor vehicles. If the tax would have to fulfill any other functions over the standard property tax, it is necessary to examine possible effects of differences in road tax in European Union member countries and address found negative effects on the central level.

In a context of increasing risk awareness, after a long period of blind trust in the virtues and soundness of the financial system, Lehman Brothers' default, announced on 15 September 2008, represented a major breakdown. Such an exception to the deeply trusted too big to fail principle - beyond generating a severe turbulence in the financial markets and stimulating far-reaching analysis on the weaknesses of regulatory schemes - left a durable scar on banking risk perception. The process of normalization which was slowly taking place during the year 2010 and the first months of 2011 quickly stopped and reversed its direction with the explosion of sovereign debt crisis in Europe, showing its intrinsic fragility. Towards the end of 2011, from many points of views, the financial markets were neighboring the extremes registered in the autumn of 2008. What we argue in this paper is that a lasting change in the traditional equilibriums and functioning of the financial system took place in Europe. This change calls for a re-thinking in banking and liquidity management, in pricing models and in monetary policy strategies. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Spiritual values at work means that the individuals and organizations consider working in a spiritual path, in an opportunity to grow and contribute to society in a meaningful way, attempting to live their values more fully in the work they do. It is also about care, compassion and support of others; an integrity and people being true to themselves and to others. In America, managers have an increasing interest in combination of spirituality and management at present. This combination has the deepest values that are effective on their work and to the same degree promise them more success. In management scope it seems that spirituality at work could have numerous applications regarding organizational behaviour. Organizational commitment has much importance among the organizational behaviour variables, since it can predict employees' turnover as a working attitude and affects output considerably. The paper aims to study the effect of spiritual values on employee's organizational commitments as well as the application of different spiritual models that could provide insights on how and under what conditions spiritual values can positively affect profitability and employees behaviour in organization. The result of the study revealed that spiritual value at work is one of the most important factors that create employees organizational commitments and the relationship between them are significantly positive. The finding also indicates that when employees experienced spirituality at work, they feel more effectively closed to their organization, experience a sense of responsibility and loyalty towards them, and feel less materially committed.

The analysis focuses, in particular, on the disclosure of goodwill. The aim of the paper is to verify if companies disclose the information required by IFRS on the impairment of goodwill. The international financial crisis has lead many companies to recognize impairment losses on goodwill or to verify twice (or more) a year whether impairment losses were generated. The increasing relevance assumed by goodwill in the financial statement of companies has led disclosure to become an extremely important issue. IAS 36 defines that companies shall disclose, among others, the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU), the basis on which the unit's recoverable amount has been determined, the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections, etc. Many studies have been conducted on the quality of voluntary disclosure of impairment and the results show that the disclosure index is very low. Thus, our paper aims at verifying if, first of all, the mandatory disclosure is shown in the notes of the consolidated financial statement. Consequently, an empirical analysis was carried out of the consolidated financial statements of the groups listed on the Italian, French, German and Spanish Stock Exchanges and belonging to the main indexes of the above-mentioned markets (FTSEMIB40, CAC40, DAX30, IBEX35). The sample is made up of 141 consolidated financial statements referring to the year 2010. The methodology of research is based on the use of the disclosure index (Botosan, 1997). The results are surprising: they show that the disclosure index is very low and there are wide differences between the stock markets analyzed. A question arises from the evidence: why is the quality of mandatory disclosure so poor? Standard setters, practitioners and academics must deal with this topic. (C) 2012 The Authors.

Today, the consumption and efficiency of energy have affected all the economical and industrial activities. Our world is the world of economical and industrial development and the process of this development has even been accelerated through the recent decades. Considering the especial situation of Iran in the world and in the region as well, energy sector is more important in this country. The energy of Iran, as one of the most powerful import-export energy of the world, is very potent in the world economy. While Iran is benefited from energy exportation, it can also affect the economy of importer countries. Energy resources in Iran consist of the third largest oil reserves and the second largest natural gas reserves in the world. Iran is in a constant battle to use its energy resources more effectively in the face of subsidization and the need for technological advances in energy exploration and production. The energy consumption in the country is extraordinarily higher than international standards. Iran recycles 28 percent of its used oil and gas whereas the figure for certain countries stands at 60 percent. With an economy which is expected to maintain a rate of growth of 2 to 5 per cent for decades, Iran's role in the world energy market becomes increasingly influential. This makes it important to predict Iran's future demand and supply for energy. The objective of this paper is to apply the Bayesian vector autoregressive methodology to forecast Iran's energy consumption and to discuss potential implications. The slower growth reflects an expected slower economic growth and the decline in energy consumption due to structural changes in the Iran economy. Iran's dwindling crude oil production will also put pressure on the internal use of refined products, as consumption and exports come to vie for the same barrel. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The paper proposes that the market return, diffusion volatility, and jump volatility are fundamental factors that change the investors' investment opportunity set. Based on estimates of diffusion and jump volatility factors using an enriched dataset including S&P 500 index returns, index options, and VIX, the paper finds negative market prices for volatility factors in the cross-section of stock returns. The findings are consistent with risk-based interpretations of value and size premia and indicate that the value effect is mainly related to the persistent diffusion volatility factor, whereas the size effect is associated with both the diffusion volatility factor and the jump volatility factor. The paper also finds that the use of market index data alone may yield counter-intuitive results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The twentieth century was broadly characterized by divergence between high-income countries and the developing world, with only a limited number (less than 10% of the economies in the world) managing to progress out of lower or middle-income status to high-income status. The last decade witnessed a sharp reversal from a pattern of divergence to convergence - particularly for a set of large middle-income countries. The latter phenomenon was also driven by increasing economic ties among developing countries and, on the intellectual scale, increased knowledge generation and sharing among the developing countries. Re-thinking development policy implies confronting these realities: twentieth century economic divergence, the experience of the handful of success stories, and the recent rise of the multi-polar growth world. This paper provides descriptive data and a literature survey to document these trends.","[Rosenblatt, David] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Lin, Justin Yifu] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",The World Bank; Peking University,"Rosenblatt, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",drosenblatt@worldbank.org,,,,,,,53,62,64,1,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

First, potential climate change impacts in dairy farming are discussed qualitatively. Second, challenges and methodological approaches in economic CCIA are presented, with a closer look at the issue of climate data and farm-level adaptation. Third, an overview and assessment of available studies on economic CCIA in dairy farming along a set of evaluation criteria is provided.

Applying this modelling approach to the data for the Czech Republic, the authors derive some implications for fiscal policy. The modelling framework includes structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model, estimated using short-term identification restrictions, and non-linear specification of the government debt dynamics. The main variables of the analyzed system are GDP, inflation, the effective interest rate on government debt, government revenues and expenditures, the exchange rate and government debt. The estimation is carried out using the Bayesian approach. The results suggest that allowing for a non-linear dynamics in the government debt to GDP ratio could imply stronger persistence and higher volatility in the responses of government indebtedness to macroeconomic shocks. The fiscal stance of the Czech Republic seems to be most vulnerable to unexpected depreciation of the local currency, discretionary pro-cyclical increases in government expenditures, and deflationary shocks.","[Melecky, Ales; Melecky, Martin] Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Melecky, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",ales.melecky@vsb.cz; m.melecky@gmail.com,"Melecky, Ales/HNP-2751-2023; Melecky, Ales/AAZ-1918-2020","Melecky, Ales/0000-0002-4495-6296; Melecky, Martin/0000-0003-3101-0482",,,,,24,2,2,2,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Discretionary accruals are larger for urban firms than rural firms after controlling for variables that affect the level of accruals. Our findings suggest that due to greater attention from large numbers of investors and other market participants, urban firms face greater pressure to manipulate earnings to satisfy market expectations. However, we fail to find evidence of an association between firm location and increased earnings management for firms audited by Big 4 auditors or firms followed by analysts, which are likely to be more closely monitored by investors and other market participants.

Economists widely adopt methods of natural sciences. But economics is a social science and the observed economic phenomena are qualitatively different from phenomena observed by natural sciences. Thus the use of natural sciences methods makes implications of economic theoretical models unrealistic. In this paper, I argue that the evidence of historical example is a good method to illuminate the implications of economic theoretical models, because if implications of economic theoretical models are illustrated in historical perspective, they can be more easily verified by common sense thus particular historical circumstances may be partly revealed.

This is an analysis of changes in contracts that were concluded on the basis of the law on public procurement. While the pre-contractual phase is treated by law, in the post-contractual phase we can identify something like a legal vacuum, which can be exploited to corrupt practices. Article examines how important (particularly in terms of impact on the price) are changes in the contracts concluded under the law on public contracts and whether it is possible to identify some factors which affect this behaviour. The regression analysis showed that the prices ex-post rise more if the open procedure was used as well as if there was strong competition on the supply side (In these cases, it is more difficult to ex-ante manipulate with the outcome of the public contract). Therefore, it is probably that a number of amendments closed an evasion of the law on public procurement, and leads to losses in the public finances.","[Pavel, Jan] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic; [Sicakova-Beblava, Emilia] Comenius Univ, Bratislava 82105, Slovakia",Prague University of Economics & Business; Comenius University Bratislava,"Pavel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",pavelj@vse.cz; ema@transparency.sk,"Sicakova-Beblava, Emilia/AAN-1160-2020; Pavel, Jan/E-5003-2017","Pavel, Jan/0000-0001-7028-0640",,,,,16,11,11,0,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The objective of this paper is to assess economic and other effects of the measure 121 Modernisation of Agricultural Holdings of the RDP 2007-2013 on the Czech farms. The counterfactual approach is adopted investigating what would have happened if the supported producers did not participate in the programme and then comparing the result indicators. The quantitative analysis of programme effects is complemented by a qualitative survey on 20 farms which received the investment support between 2008 and 2010. The quantitative assessment showed significant benefits of the investment support in terms of business expansion (GVA) and productivity (GVA/labour costs) improvements. These results were confirmed by the qualitative survey. It showed that production expansion and productivity increase were primary objectives of the investment strategies on most of the farms. The public support enabled farms to achieve these strategic objectives. The respondents of the survey declared that the supported investment was important for their prosperity however, we could not prove it in the quantitative assessment in terms of profit and cost/revenue ratio. Finally, the issue of deadweight of the investment support is discussed: the figures on very low net investment relatively to the provided public support at the sector level and answers of respondents indicate possible significant deadweight, however, the insight is incomplete, since it does not take into account post accession restructuring of the sector and multiannual and multi-enterprise character of investment at the farm level.","[Ratinger, Tomas; Medonos, Tomas; Spicka, Jindrich; Hruska, Martin; Vilhelm, Vaclav] Inst Agr Econ & Informat UZEI Praha, Prague, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Ratinger, T (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat UZEI Praha, Prague, Czech Republic.",ratinger.tomas@uzei.cz,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0002-9266-9435",,,,,12,1,1,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,96,111,,,,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800007,0

To the authors' knowledge, no quantitative investigations of farmers' preferences with regard to supply contracts for biogas plants have been carried out so far. Hence, it has been only possible to a limited extent to make predictions for a targeted arrangement of supply contracts. We, therefore, investigated, to what extent different factors have relevance for the conclusion of substrate supply contracts. This has been done by conducting a survey with 178 German farm managers. The survey included a choice experiment in which participants were confronted with different contract features. These features were varied systematically and thus revealed the influence of each individual feature on the probability of contract conclusion. It becomes clear that the farmers who were interviewed preferred to conclude contracts with other farmers or with a bioenergy village rather than with external investors. The probability of contract conclusion decreases with an increasing lifetime of the contract. However, a contract with a higher sales price is more attractive for the farmers. The investigation of the characteristics of respondents shows that the amount of the premium for one additional year of contractual lifetime depends on the individual valuation of the entrepreneurial freedom of the respective farm manager. It cannot be established that risk-averse farmers tend to prefer contracts with fixed prices over contracts with price adjustment clauses. In addition, there are no great differences in the choice behavior of farmers who have already signed a substrate supply contract and farmers without this experience.","[Reise, Christian; Liebe, Ulf; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Liebe, Ulf] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany",University of Gottingen; Universitat Kassel,"Reise, C (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agr Wissensch, Dept Agr Okon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",creise@uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,66,8,8,1,23,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

To begin with, it is only a matter of time before Indonesia's emissions from fossil fuels overtake those from deforestation. Given the long technological lock-in effects of energy systems and industries, Indonesia needs to think now about how it will tackle this problem. There are other reasons for believing that Indonesia might learn something from China - the CO2 intensities of GDP, of industry and of cement production have been rising in Indonesia, while they are falling in China. China's better intensity performance is due to policies that Indonesia would do well to follow - adopting a technological catch-up industrial development strategy; raising energy prices to scarcity values; liberalising domestic markets and opening the economy to trade and investment; and mounting a massive energy saving program.","[Rock, Michael T.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Rock, Michael T.] Bryn Mawr Coll, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA",Resources for the Future; Bryn Mawr College,"Rock, MT (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",mrock@brynmawr.edu,"Rock, Michael/O-7993-2018","Rock, Michael/0000-0003-1310-7387",,,,,72,10,10,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Our findings indicate that an increase in unemployment benefits and in taxes does not generate a strong decline in mobility but does increase unemployment as in the standard model.

Agricultural economics is a policy science and so scientific research programmes operate simultaneously with political action programmes. Taking policy positions and advising government makes scientific detachment impossible. With this as background progress in production economics is considered, especially regarding technology, productivity and the returns to R&D. The position taken is that progress has been considerable and we can by now measure technological progress and show how it is generated by agricultural R&D. Almost all the studies show that this is an investment with a high rate of return. The main point of the study is that almost all the agricultural economics research that has made this possible was conducted in the USA, where the theory and data were in place when needed to convince the politicians that public funding should be maintained at adequate levels. The payoff is that agricultural productivity has grown monotonically in the USA. The UK case shows the costs of our profession failing to mount an effective political action programme in the area at time of Mrs Thatcher's cuts in the early 1980s. The result was about sixteen years of negative productivity growth. This should act as a warning for South Africa, which is pretty clearly cutting R&D and following the UK productivity path. These failures are so costly, it is odd that only USA seems to have the knowledge and funding required for steady productivity growth.","[Thirtle, C.] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Thirtle, C.] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Thirtle, C.] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",Imperial College London; Stellenbosch University; University of Pretoria,"Thirtle, C (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, London, England.",c.thirtle@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,25,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2012,51.0,3,,,,,1,23,,10.1080/03031853.2012.749566,0.0,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,081XC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314354700001,0

Further research is needed to focus more on how to assess the size of the global shadow banking sector, how to regulate the shadow banking system effectively and to develop new approaches such as model analysis and empirical analysis.","[Ye Fang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,,,,,,,,18,1,1,3,34,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5611-7073-1,,,,2012,,,,,,,20,22,,,,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDD89,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312877300004,0

Our approach is motivated by the testing procedures of Vogelsang [1998, Econometrica, vol 66, p123-148] and Bunzel and Vogelsang [2005, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, vol 23, p381-394], but utilises an auxiliary unit root test to switch between critical values in the exact I(1) and I(0) environments, rather than using this unit root test to scale the test statistic as is done in the aforementioned procedures. We show that our proposed tests have uniformly greater local asymptotic power than the tests of Vogelsang (1998) and Bunzel and Vogelsang (2005) when the error process is exact I(1), identical local asymptotic when the error process is 1(0), and have better overall local asymptotic power when the error process is near 1(1). Our proposed tests also display superior finite sample power to the tests of Vogelsang (1998) and Bunzel and Vogelsang (2005) and are competitive in finite samples with tests designed to be optimal in both the exact 1(1) and 1(0) environments. We apply our test procedures to a number of equity indices and find that these series appear to have a significant upward deterministic trend, yet are also highly persistent about this long run growth path.

Additional economic issues have rarely been studied. In this survey article we study the likely causes for the inconclusive findings. While various factors have an influence on the results, especially the choice of the sample period is of crucial importance. While in the very long run we find unemployment and inflation to have a robust effect on presidential approval, this holds not true for shorter sub-periods. This result might indicate that the popularity function is instable overtime. However, the findings might also be taken as an indication that the most often employed linear estimation approach is inadequate. Further research on these issues is necessary. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

I explain that tax planning that results in certain tax benefits should not constitute aggressiveness. Although policy makers may argue that these tax planning opportunities are attributable to tax loopholes, this assertion does not imply that the firm has undertaken any significant risk by entering into such tax planning. By documenting that low effective tax rates are not necessarily associated with risky or uncertain tax planning, I hope to convince future researchers to develop better empirical proxies for capturing aggressive tax planning.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Blouin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",blouin@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,22,76,89,13,77,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Using a simple model where entrepreneurs receive individual uncollateralized loans, we show that, not surprisingly, state intervention through the loan guarantee increases the number of entrepreneurs receiving a loan. However, after modeling business development services (BDS) provided by the microfinance institution, we show that the loan guarantee can have a counterproductive effect by reducing the number of entrepreneurs benefiting from such services. We therefore analyze an alternative policy: BDS subsidization. We show that if BDS are efficient enough and are targeted toward less performing borrowers, then-for fixed government expenditures-such subsidies do better in terms of financial inclusion than the loan guarantee. Moreover, we argue that-under similar conditions-BDS subsidization alone does better in terms of financial inclusion than a mix of policies.","[Bourles, Renaud] Ecole Cent Marseille, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, F-13013 Marseille, France; [Bourles, Renaud] Ecole Cent Marseille, EHESS, F-13013 Marseille, France; [Cozarenco, Anastasia] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Cozarenco, Anastasia] Aix Marseille Univ, EHESS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Cozarenco, A (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France.",anastasia.cozarenco@univ-amu.fr,"Bourlès, Renaud/AAJ-3766-2020","Bourlès, Renaud/0000-0001-9537-1258",,,,,34,5,7,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This configuration is used to analyze the profits sensitivity to exchange rate changes. The originality of the article lies in the assumption that exchange rate shocks can either boost or depress liquidity, thus allowing one to study exposure in different scenarios. The model predicts that the sensitivity of a firm's profits to exchange rate changes depends on its financial condition: an increase in the cost of external funds makes profits less sensitive to exchange rate shocks when a firm's liquidity decreases following a depreciation of the domestic currency. The predictions of the model are tested using a large data set of French exporting firms: results confirm that for firms whose liquidity is negatively correlated with exchange rate movements, an increase in financial costs lowers exposure.","[Guillou, Sarah] OFCE SciencesPo, SKEMA Business Sch, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] OFCE SciencesPo, I-38122 Trento, Italy",SKEMA Business School; University of Trento; University of Trento,"Schiavo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Via T Gar 14, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",sarah.guillou@sciencespo.fr; stefano.schiavo@unitn.it,"SCHIAVO, Stefano/B-6147-2012","SCHIAVO, Stefano/0000-0001-9740-5167",,,,,26,1,1,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

For most calibrations with separable preferences, net welfare gains are increasing in trade openness. The reason is that in more open economies terms of trade shocks, which favor inflation targeting, become quantitatively more important, while price markup shocks in the imperfectly competitive nontradables sector, which favor exchange rate targeting, become less important. The most important exception is heavily indebted countries, where net welfare gains are decreasing in trade openness.","[Kamenik, Ondra] OGResearch, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kumhof, Michael] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Econ Modeling Div, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kamenik, O (通讯作者)，OGResearch, Prague, Czech Republic.",ondra.kamenik@ogresearch.com; mkumhof@imf.org,,,ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,37,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We find that in the expansion state the expected returns of winner stocks are more affected by aggregate economic conditions than those of loser stocks, while in the recession state the expected returns of loser stocks are more affected than those of winner stocks. Consequently, expected momentum profits display strong procyclical variations. We argue that the observed momentum profits are the realization of such expected returns and can be interpreted as the procyclicality premium. We provide a plausible explanation for time-varying momentum profits through the differential effect of leverage and growth options across business cycles. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This way we allow for the empirically observed persistence in time series such as interest rates, often implying unit-roots, while at the same time maintain stationarity despite such unit-roots. Specifically, the model bridges vector autoregressions and multivariate ARCH models in which residuals are replaced by levels lagged. An empirical illustration using recent US term structure data is given in which the individual interest rates are found to have unit roots, have no finite first-order moments, but remain strictly stationary and ergodic. Moreover, they co-move in the sense that their spread has no unit root. The model thus allows for volatility induced stationarity, and the paper shows conditions under which the multivariate process is strictly stationary and geometrically ergodic. Interestingly, these conditions include the case of unit roots and a reduced rank structure in the conditional mean, known from linear co-integration. Asymptotic theory of the maximum likelihood estimators for a particular structured case (so-called self-exciting) is provided, and it is shown that root T-convergence to Gaussian distributions apply despite unit roots as well as absence of finite first and higher order moments. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the asymptotic theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, past experiences suggest that such sanctions are often ineffective; moreover, quite paradoxically, targeted regimes tend to respond with policies that amplify the sanctions' harmful effects. This paper offers a political-economy model which provides an explanation for these observations. An autocratic regime lowers the supply of public goods to reduce private-sector productivity and hence the resources of potential challengers. As a result, sanctions-induced challenges become less likely, thereby buying the regime time to find exile opportunities. If these opportunities turn out to be of low quality, the regime prefers to hold out - and the sanctions fail. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, current transportation investments focus on strengthening connections within Mumbai City, while these outlying nodes have received less attention. As housing and jobs move out, given limited travel choices, the need for mobility nudges many middle class Indian households into owning private vehicles. Using household travel survey data from the GMR, this paper develops an understanding of how worker's trips are different for those who commute to the city versus the exurbs. Socio-economic and transportation indicators for middle class workers going to the city versus the exurbs show that these populations are quite similar demographically. However, those traveling to the exurbs, on average, tend to be at a socio-economic disadvantage with respect to income, education and out-of-pocket travel burdens. Those traveling to exurban work locations have shorter travel times and trip distances, and make much higher use of walking, biking, rickshaws, and motorized two-wheelers compared to commuters to Mumbai City. Across the GMR, car users travel longer and farther compared to motorized two-wheeler users. On average, traveling by a private vehicle is faster than bus or rickshaw travel revealing advantages of private vehicle use. These mode choices in the middle class have resulted in rapid motorization and negative externalities such as traffic congestion and emissions. Evidence of large increases in motorized two-wheelers and cars in India suggests that these modes will likely keep growing, unless competing efficient travel options are supplied.

We find that the level of cash holdings increases as state ownership declines. For the average firm in our sample, a 10 percentage-point decline in state ownership leads to an increase of about RMB 55 million in cash holdings. This negative relation can be attributable to the soft-budget constraint (SBC) inherent in state ownership. The Chinese financial system is dominated by the state-owned banks, an environment very conducive for the SBC effect We further examine and quantify the effect of state ownership on the value of cash and find that the marginal value of cash increases as state ownership declines. The next RMB added to cash reserves of the average firm is valued at RMB 0.96 by the market.

Some scholars, such as Scott Shane in this journal, have argued that it is 'bad' public policy. But this simply begs the question why the legislative process should generate bad policy? To answer this question this study examines the UK's enterprise policy process in the 2009-2010 period. It suggests that a key factor for the ineffectiveness of policy is how it is formulated. This stage in the policy process is seldom visible to those outside of government departments and has been largely ignored by prior research. The application of institutional theory provides a detailed theoretical understanding of the actors and the process by which enterprise policy is formulated. We find that by opening up the 'black box' of enterprise policy formulation, the process is dominated by powerful actors who govern the process with their interests.","[Arshed, Norin] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management & Languages, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Carter, Sara] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Glasgow G4 0QU, Lanark, Scotland; [Mason, Colin] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Heriot Watt University; University of Strathclyde; University of Glasgow,"Arshed, N (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management & Languages, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",n.arshed@hw.ac.uk; sara.carter@strath.ac.uk; colin.mason@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Arshed, Norin/0000-0002-6775-1840; Carter, Sara/0000-0001-5812-4354",ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,144,89,96,2,78,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We predict and find a surge of special dividends in the final months of 2010 and 2012, immediately before individual-level dividend tax rates were expected to increase. We also find evidence that immediately before the expected tax increases, firms altered the timing of their regular dividend payments by shifting what would normally be January regular dividend payments into the preceding December. To our knowledge this is the first evidence in the literature about changes in the timing of regular dividend payments in response to tax law changes. For both actions (specials and shifting), we find that it was more likely for a firm to respond to individual-level tax rates if insiders owned a relatively large amount of the firm.

The framework models banks' default dependence explicitly and captures the time-varying nonlinearities and feedback effects typical of financial markets. It measures banking systemic credit risk in the three forms categorized by the European Central Bank: (1) credit risk common to all banks; (2) credit risk in the banking system conditional on distress on a specific bank or combinations of banks; and (3) the buildup of banking system vulnerabilities over time which may unravel disorderly. In addition, the estimates of the common components of the banking sector short-term and conditional forward default measures contain early warning features, and the identification of their drivers is useful for macroprudential policy. Finally, the framework produces robust out-of-sample forecasts of the banking systemic credit risk measures. This paper advances the agenda of making macroprudential policy operational.

In normal times, when economic dynamics are driven by supply shocks, an active use of capital requirements generates modest benefits in terms of volatility of the target variables compared to the case in which only the central bank carries out stabilization policies. The lack of cooperation between the two policymakers may result in excessive volatility of the monetary policy rate and capital requirements. The benefits of introducing capital requirements become sizeable when financial shocks, which affect the supply of loans, are important drivers of economic dynamics; the availability of capital requirements as a policy tool yields a significant gain in terms of macroeconomic stabilization, regardless of the type of interaction between monetary and capital requirements policies.","[Angelini, Paolo] Banca Italia, Directorate Gen Financial Supervis & Regulat, Rome, Italy; [Neri, Stefano] Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Directorate, Rome, Italy; [Panetta, Fabio] Banca Italia, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Angelini, P (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Directorate Gen Financial Supervis & Regulat, Rome, Italy.",stefano.neri@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,77,142,157,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The analysis employs firm-level productivity data and exploits variations in banking sector development, judicial enforcement, and social capital across Italian provinces. After controlling for potential endogeneity, our empirical results suggest that the real effects of financial development are conditional on the quality of the socio-institutional environment. In particular, we find that the positive effects of greater financial depth on productivity are stronger when the socio-institutional environment is sufficiently developed. Therefore, to exploit potential productivity gains stimulated by financial development, it is necessary to achieve a higher-quality socio-institutional environment, including reducing the duration of civil trials.

Compared with numerous studies that identified the benefits for being a chain system, recent researches on organizational identity highlight the social sanctions and discount when an organizational form does not fully conform to the norms and expectations at a given market. Empirical evidence from California retail banks in the 20th century demonstrates that organizational identity can be an important source of competitive strength even when considerable scale and scope advantages exist. However, when customers are not locally oriented, an organization's identity-based appeal becomes less meaningful.

I show that these changes in MBS duration function as large-scale shocks to the quantity of interest rate risk that must be borne by professional bond investors. I develop a simple model in which the risk tolerance of bond investors is limited in the short run, so these fluctuations in MBS duration generate significant variation in bond risk premia. Specifically, bond risk premia are high when aggregate MBS duration is high. The model offers an explanation for why long-term rates could appear to be excessively sensitive to movements in short rates and explains how changes in MBS duration act as a positive-feedback mechanism that amplifies interest rate volatility. I find strong support for these predictions in the time series of US government bond returns. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Focusing primarily on emerging markets, this paper analyzes the impact of exchange rate flexibility on credit markets during periods of large capital inflows. It is shown that bank credit is larger and its composition tilts to foreign currency in economies with less flexible exchange rate regimes, and that these results are not explained entirely by the fact that the latter attract more capital inflows than economies with more flexible regimes. The findings thus suggest countries with less flexible exchange rate regimes may stand to benefit the most from regulatory policies that reduce banks' incentives to tap external markets and to lend/borrow in foreign currency; these policies include marginal reserve requirements on foreign lending, currency-dependent liquidity requirements and higher capital requirement and/or dynamic provisioning on foreign exchange loans.","[Reinhart, Carmen M.] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Magud, Nicolas E.; Vesperoni, Esteban R.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Harvard University; International Monetary Fund,"Vesperoni, ER (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",Carmen_Reinhart@harvard.edu,"Magud, Nicolas/AAW-5912-2020","Magud, Nicolas/0000-0001-6274-7650; Vesperoni, Esteban/0000-0002-6284-9726",,,,,33,47,52,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Because the vast majority of new firms are short-lived, it is a risky decision to accept employment in a new venture. It can be argued that individuals with little (or no) labor market experience are more willing to accept the high risks associated with employment in new firms. Hence, new firms may work as an entry point to the labor market. Nevertheless, some research concludes that one disadvantage of employment in a new firm is that new firms pay less (Shane in Small Bus Econ 33:141-149, 2009). However, this empirical conclusion is primarily based on literature on the wage penalty of small firms. In this paper, we study whether the wage penalty of employment in a new firm persists if we focus solely on labor market entrants. In the empirical analysis, we employ an employer-employee matched dataset that covers the Swedish population during the period from 1998 to 2008. We use the propensity score matching method to study the wage differences between labor market entrants employed in new and incumbent firms. We find an average wage penalty of 2.9 % for labor market entrants employed in new firms over the studied period.","[Nystrom, Kristina; Elvung, Gulzat Zhetibaeva] Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Nyström, K (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Stockholm, Sweden.",kristina.nystrom@indek.kth.se,,"Nystrom, Kristina/0000-0002-1692-8677",,,,,41,21,26,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Previous studies dealing with financial crises and contagion show the linkages through which financial stress are transmitted from advanced to emerging markets. This paper extends the existing literature on the use of financial stress index (FSI) in understanding the channels of financial transmission in emerging market economies. Using FSI of 25 emerging markets, our panel regression estimates show that not only advanced economies FSI, but also regional and nonregional emerging market FSIs significantly increase domestic financial stress. Our findings also suggest that there is a common regional factor significantly affecting domestic FSI in emerging Asia and emerging Europe. Furthermore, the results from a structural vector autoregression model with contemporaneous restrictions indicate that although a domestic financial shock still accounts for most of the variation in domestic FSI, regional shocks play an important role in emerging Asia.

These axioms state essentially that neither the welfare of present nor future generations ought to be favoured over the other in determining the socially optimal path of economic development. The method is to calibrate a modified Ramsey model of optimal global growth and saving, where pollution is generated by the global output of goods and services. Pollution in turn reduces output. The simulation results illustrate how sensitive the optimal pollution price and abatement expenditure can be over time to assumptions about the social time preference rate. They also show that 'sustainable' preferences impose a lower burden on future generations in terms of the pollution price and abatement expenditure. Hence there is a case for governments to make explicit their value judgments about intergenerational welfare, in the context of their notion of sustainable development, when setting target pollution abatement levels and pollution prices over time.","Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Guest, R (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",r.guest@griffith.edu.au,,"Guest, Ross/0000-0002-7171-3054",,,,,20,4,4,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A hedonic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between median block-group-level residential property valuations and the distance to the station with TOD and other stations with direct, non-stop access to New York City, while controlling for demographic and housing variables. Spatial econometric software and techniques are used to control for spatial autocorrelation.

The model accounts explicitly for both foreign direct investment and the activities of foreign affiliates using heterogeneous production technologies. We find that the unilateral reduction of barriers to FDI in distribution services in India benefits the economy as a whole, consumers, and foreign producers but hurts domestic distributors.

The main objective is to explore whether companies that pay their CEO excessive fees (in comparison to those of peer firms in the same industry and size group) generate superior future returns and better operating performance. Our analysis, which separately considers the cash-based and incentive/equity-based components of CEO compensation, is based on a large sample of UK-listed companies over the period 1998-2010. We find that CEO incentive pay is negatively associated with short-term subsequent returns. Interestingly, firms that pay their CEOs at the bottom of the incentive-pay distribution earn positive abnormal returns and, also, significantly outperform those at the top of the incentive-pay distribution. Further analysis reveals that such outperformance can be largely explained by the excessive exposure of low-incentive-pay firms to idiosyncratic risk. Finally, evidence from panel regressions suggests that, in addition to its negative relationship with returns, incentive pay is also inversely associated with future operating performance.

Also, since our social safety net is designed to shelter Canadians, including children, from both economic hardship and economic loss, it is also important, from the perspective of policy, to assess risk factors for persistent low income as well as correlates of major economic loss.","[Burton, Peter; Phipps, Shelley] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Phipps, Shelley] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Zhang, Lihui] Univ Regina, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",Dalhousie University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); University of Regina,"Burton, P (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS, Canada.",,,,,,,,30,7,8,0,7,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Employing the event study methodology, we find that the directions, declarations, and implicit suggestions by Japanese prime ministers regarding economic countermeasures are considered by market participants as signals for future fiscal expansion. In addition, the probability that the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields increase by these statements correlates with the monthly increments in the leading index of business conditions and the number of newly issued bonds in the relevant supplementary budgets. Moreover, by estimating the reduced form equations for the long-term interest rates derived in the neoclassical framework, we find that a percentage point increase in both the projected/current deficit-to-GDP ratio and projected/current primary-deficit-to-GDP ratios raises real 10-year interest rates by 26-34 basis points. However, the increases in the projected are found to be more significant than those in the current. Furthermore, we find that the current government debt to GDP ratio only raises the rates by 1.2 basis points at most. These results suggest that the projected deficit is important than the current deficit and that budget deficits have larger effects than government debt, which are consistent with Feldstein (1986). Finally, on the basis of a factorial decomposition based on an estimation result in the current deficit case, we estimate that the real budget deficit in 2008 causes an approximately 2-3% increase in the JGB yields, which depresses the real GDP by 0.39-0.63 percentage points in 2008, on the basis of the preceding literature on private investment.

A number of prominent observers have pointed to the GSE Act as a root cause of the recent housing crisis. This paper evaluates the link between the GSE Act and relaxed mortgage market standards. Using loan application-level data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, I analyze whether the GSE Act's single-family affordable housing goals altered mortgage lending or purchasing decisions. To identify this effect, I use a regression discontinuity design that exploits arbitrary cutoffs used to determine whether a loan satisfies the GSE Act goals. I find that the GSE Act's single-family affordable housing goals increased GSE purchases from very low-income borrowers by 4.4% but had no effect on mortgage lending. These results stand up to a number of specification and robustness checks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, this paper assumes that complicated dynamics in recent asset markets are attributed to the significant effects of time-varying and heterogeneous risk attitudes as well as agents' herd behavior, and generalizes an adaptive beliefs system in order to characterize them. This paper also analyzes the existence of stable steady states of the generalized adaptive beliefs system, providing a new psychological insight into excessive and asymmetric volatility. Given the dynamic system, numerical simulations find that, when the chartists are less risk averse than the fundamentalists and their herding propensity increases, time variation in risk attitudes gives rise to large amplitude changes in proportion to agent groups and expand price fluctuations through chaotic dynamics. Along these lines, this paper highlights that psychological factors serve as decisive source of asymmetry in volatility as well as excess volatility, which are observed in the return data.

Small firms generate demand for specialized services that lower entry costs for others. This effect is particularly relevant in the presence of large firms that spawn spin-outs caused by innovations deemed unrelated to the firm's overall business. We examine MSA-level patent data during the period 1975-2000 and find that innovation output is higher in regions where both a sizable population of small firms and large labs are present.

This paper documents the presence of small and large jumps in the stochastic process of the CO futures price. The large jumps have a discrete origin, i.e. they can arise from various demand factors or institutional decisions on the tradable permits market. Contrary to the existing literature, we show that the stochastic process of carbon futures prices does not contain a continuous component (Brownian motion). The results are derived by using high-frequency data in the activity signature function framework (Todorov and Tauchen in J Econom 154:125-138, 2010; Todorov and Tauchen in J Bus Econ Stat 29:356-371, 2011). The implication is that the carbon futures price should be modeled as an appropriately sampled, centered L,vy or Poisson process. The pure-jump behavior of the carbon price might be explained by the lower volume of trades on this allowance market (compared to other highly liquid financial markets).","[Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, F-75006 Paris, France; [Sevi, Benoit] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, F-13290 Aix En Provence, France; [Sevi, Benoit] Aix Marseille Univ, EHESS, F-13290 Aix En Provence, France",IPAG Business School; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Chevallier, J (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",julien.chevallier04@univ-paris8.fr; benoit.sevi@univ-amu.fr,"Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; Chevallier, Julien/0000-0001-9109-0205",,,,,71,19,20,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

If, in contrast, an origin-based production tax is employed, a strict Pareto improvement holds whether marginal cost is decreasing or not.

Many macro-economists assumed that the global financial crisis would change the prevalent way of economic thinking. This paper considers this idea and raises the question if a paradigm change in the German debate on macroeconomic policy has occurred. To this end, the paper analyzes and compares the macroeconomic policy recommendations of the most important German macroeconomic reports - Sachverstandigenratsgutachten and Gemeinschaftsdiagnose - during the course of three economic slumps, including the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The comparison shows that - notwithstanding that some minor changes in economic policy took place - there has been no paradigm change in the economic policy debates since the 2008-2009 world crisis. The absence of a significant change in the policy concepts raises the question of why there is such a high stability of the approaches of the two reports. It is suggested that the institutional context in which the expert discourse is embedded contributes to this stability.","Univ Basel, Ctr Relig Econ & Polit, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Koehrsen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Ctr Relig Econ & Polit, Heuberg 12, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",jens.koehrsen@unibas.ch,,"Koehrsen, Jens/0000-0002-0191-9671",,,,,70,3,3,0,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This paper develops a model where board decisions depend on directors' effort in communicating their information to others. I show that directors communicate more effectively when pressure for conformity is stronger-that is, when directors are more reluctant to disagree with each other. Hence, open ballot voting can be optimal, even though it induces directors to disregard their information and conform their votes to others. I also show that communication can be more efficient when directors' preferences are more diverse.

We also show that the long-run degree of privatization is larger than the short-run one, and the long-run tariff rate is smaller than the short-run tariff if and only if the entry cost of domestic private firms is sufficiently low.

Historically, plantation companies have always provided accommodation for their workers, and as a result play a central role in the supervision of the domestic sphere. This paternalistic aspect of labour relations has evolved from being coercive during the indenture system, through a progressive loosening. This paper analyses the history of paternalistic labour relations in Indonesia and Indonesian labour laws. It includes a description of compounds in Indonesian oil palm plantations, where thousands of permanent workers and their families are housed. The compounds are characterized by comprehensive and continuous supervision. Although they generally accept paternalistic labour relations as conferring them with a high degree of security, inhabitants also manage to develop particular ways of negotiating control and asserting autonomy.","Ctr Maurice Halbwachs CNRS EHESS ENS Paris, UMR ART Dev, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Barral, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Maurice Halbwachs CNRS EHESS ENS Paris, UMR ART Dev, 73 Rue JF Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",phanette.barral@gmail.com,,"Barral, Stephanie/0000-0002-0557-5941",,,,,22,10,10,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Our main contribution is the detection of contrary dynamics within the Google Home Financing subcategory, which to date yields empirically mixed evidence (Hohenstatt, Kaesbauer, and Schaefers, 2011). Sensitivity analysis yields that transaction volume responds twice as sensitively as house prices due to a standard deviation increase of the stress indicator.

Using a linear dynamic panel data model for 113 countries from 1980 to 2006 and a system-GMM estimator, we find that an increase in the number of episodes of government crisis, less democracy and presidentialist systems raise the volatility of the discretionary component of fiscal policy.

Critics predicted that businesses would experience an increase in their borrowing costs because of the risk that politically-powerful junior claimants might now leap-frog other creditors. We examine the financial market where this effect would be most detectible, the market for bonds of highly unionized companies.

Identical consumers buy two goods using income from endowments that are mobile between sectors. Usually an increase in one sector's tax raises output price, so consumption shifts to the other good, causing positive leakage. Here, we find a new negative effect not recognized in existing literature: the taxed sector substitutes away from carbon into clean inputs, so it may absorb resources, shrink the other sector, and reduce their emissions. This abatement resource effect could offset some or all of the positive effect.

Whilst this helps to mitigate business risk, it lowers market valuations and drives down expected returns. Our evidence supports arguments that the value premium is explained by economic fundamentals rather than a risk factor that is common to all firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Our ES approach is suitable for situations where a decision maker refrains from evaluating success probabilities of forecasting models but prefers to think by analogy. It allows to determine weights of the forecasting combination by quantifying distances between model predictions and corresponding realizations of the process of interest as they are perceived by decision makers. The proposed ES approach is applied for combining models in order to forecast daily volatility of the major stock market indices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While there have been a number of empirical attempts to verify the presence of capital mobility using the Feldstein-Horioka (FH) approach, none of them to the best of our knowledge have explicitly examined capital mobility changes across regional economic groupings in Africa, analyzing sub-samples to compare effects of pre-versus post integration. Filling this gap in the literature, this paper analyzes how some major regional economic integration initiatives, such as SACU (South African Customs Union), UEMOA (West African Economic and Monetary Union), COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) and ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States)) have influenced capital mobility in their member countries. To estimate the investment and savings relationship, we use Pedroni's (2004) fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) panel cointegration method, applying to a sample of 25 African countries for which annual data is available from 1960 to 2009. To assess robustness of our results, we also employ the fixed effects, random effects and Mark and Sul's (2003) dynamic OLS (DOLS) methods. Our findings suggest that international capital mobility has only slightly increased in the African countries due to these agreements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

However, there has been surprisingly little research on whether state merit aid programs are effective at this goal. This paper investigates the effect of state merit aid programs on the post-college location of 24-30 year olds. We use decennial census and American Community Survey microdata to consider post-college retention effects in the 25 states that implemented merit aid programs between 1991 and 2004. Our preferred specification implies that strong state merit aid programs on average increase the probability that a college attendee lives in his or her birth state during ages 24-30 by 2.76 percentage points. We also estimate the effect for individual states and find meaningful differences across states in the effect of merit aid programs on in-state post-college retention and explore explanations for these differences.

We find that risk shifting through pension underfunding (and, to a lesser extent, through pension asset allocation to risky securities) is stronger with compensation structures that create high wealth-risk sensitivity (vega) and weaker with high wealth-price sensitivity (delta). These findings are stronger for chief financial officers (CFOs) than for chief executive officers (CEOs), suggesting that pension policy falls within the CFO's domain. Risk shifting through pension underfunding is also lower when the CFO's personal stake in the pension plan is larger. Overall, these findings show that top managers' compensation structure is an important driver of corporate pension policy.

The results of the questionnaire enlighten reasons for undesired deviations from plans and strategy; in addition self-estimation of internal or external factors of decisions under not-certainty and their ramifications to the sustainable execution of obligatory and voluntary tasks. Hence the results are helpful to enlighten customer responsibility. This field research was carried out in the period 2009-2012 with data evaluated from 23 filled in questionnaires with 45 questions. Targets were small to middle local municipalities up to 100.000 inhabitants and county administrations up to 400.000 inhabitants in North Rhine Westphalia of prime importance.

The likelihood of being named is greater for audit committee members and directors who sell stock during the class period. Named directors receive more negative recommendations from Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm, and significantly more negative votes from shareholders than directors in a benchmark sample.

We articulate a demand-pull innovation framework in which knowledge creation is driven by sales growth, and knowledge stems from creative recombination. Building on the literature on HGFs and economic growth, we investigate whether gazelles follow patterns of knowledge creation dominated by exploration or exploitation strategies. We construct indicators for the structure of knowledge and identify firms' innovation strategies. The empirical results show that increasing growth rates are associated with exploration, supporting the idea that HGFs are key actors in the creation of new technological knowledge, and showing also that firms that achieve higher than average growth focus on exploration based on familiar technology. This suggests that exploration is less random than has been suggested. Our main result is that HGFs, especially gazelles, predominantly adopt exploration strategies that have the characteristics of organized search more often observed among firms following an exploitation strategy.","[Colombelli, Alessandra; Krafft, Jackie; Quatraro, Francesco] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Colombelli, Alessandra] Politecn Torino, DIGEP, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Colombelli, Alessandra; Quatraro, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Polytechnic University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Colombelli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, 250 Rue Ablert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",alessandra.colombelli@polito.ot; jackie.krafft@gredeg.cnrs.fr; francesco.quatraro@unice.fr,"krafft, jackie/J-6278-2012; Quatraro, Francesco/S-3012-2017","COLOMBELLI, ALESSANDRA/0000-0003-4513-8612; Quatraro, Francesco/0000-0001-5746-2239; KRAFFT, Jackie/0000-0002-8011-9866",,,,,82,69,75,2,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The present paper is the result of an investigation carried out in this field and it is distinguished by two aspects. The first aspect is its target audience used for research - household consumers of electricity, who can be called vulnerable, captive consumers. The second aspect is the specificity of the electricity market. The aim of the research was to study the relationship between corporate social responsibility, instantiated by the quality of services provided by S.C. Electrica S.A. - Electrica Distribution and Supply South Transylvania and the consumers' loyalty towards the company, in case other electricity suppliers emerge. A subsidiary aspect was the generation of a database having an impact on customer retention. We have carried out some quantitative research, based on the survey method, having a sample of 521 household consumers from the Mures County. The study we carried out proves that consumer satisfaction, their degree of satisfaction under different aspects, is a way of gaining their trust on this particular market. Those consumers with a higher degree of trust in the company are more loyal. This will result in reducing migration to another electricity supplier, in the future, when all household consumers become eligible.","[Georgescu, Maria-Ana; Herman, Emilia] Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures","Herman, E (通讯作者)，Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania.",emilia_herman@yahoo.com,"YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/F-1270-2019; Herman, Emilia/GQB-3206-2022; Herman, Emilia/K-7284-2014; Herman, Emilia/S-8210-2019","YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/0000-0001-5240-1023; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585",,,,,19,5,5,2,32,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,123,137,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300009,0

In recent years, the visible transformation in the way that many banks are conducting business with SMEs suggests that a paradigm shift is taking place in SME finance. This country study contributes to the newly emerging literature on the subject by providing evidence on how this transformation is taking place in the Turkish banking sector. The findings of this research reveal that in Turkey, the large banks are not only allocating a bigger share of their loan portfolio to SMEs but are also reaching down to the smaller businesses more than the small banks are doing. These findings underline the importance of the large commercial banks for increasing SMEs' access to finance in the Turkish economy.","Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Banking & Finance, North Cyprus 10, Mersin, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Jenkins, H (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Banking & Finance, North Cyprus 10, Mersin, Turkey.",hatice.jenkins@emu.edu.tr,,,,,,,56,1,1,0,49,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Using propensity score matching to attempt to control for self-selection and data from two surveys implemented in 2008 and 2010, we find that the urban boomers tend to be less automobile-dependent than suburban baby boomers. Urban baby boomers also make more recreational non-motorized transport (NMT), social, utilitarian, and transit commute trips. Most of these differences seem to be primarily a result of the urban setting, not the particular preferences of boomers living in urban settings. We find very small self-selection effects on automobile commuting, recreational NMT, and utilitarian trips: 1-7% of observed influence. We also find some evidence that baby boomers' preference for social activities tends to be mismatched to their environments - suburban boomers want more social opportunities than their settings enable. For public transport, we find a relatively large self-selection effect, 43% of observed influence, suggesting a transit-oriented boomer market segment exists. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine and evaluate the direct effect of higher indebtedness on economic growth for countries in the EU which are in the epicentre of the current sovereign debt crisis. In comparison to similar empirical studies, our research will add to the existing literature by extending the sample of countries and providing the latest empirical evidence for a non-linear and concave (i.e. inverted U-shape) relationship. The empirical analysis primarily includes a panel dataset of 25 sovereign member states of the EU. Our sample of EU countries is divided into subgroups distinguishing between so-called 'old' member states, covering the period 1980-2010, and 'new' member states, covering the period 1995-2010. In order to account for the impact of the level of the debt-to-GDP ratio on the real growth rate of GDP, we employ a panel estimation on a generalized economic growth model augmented with a debt variable, while also considering some methodological issues like the problems of heterogeneity and endogeneity. The results across all models indicate a statistically significant non-linear impact of public debt ratios on annual GDP per capita growth rates. Further, the calculated debt-to-GDP turning point, where the positive effect of accumulated public debt inverts into a negative effect, is roughly between 80% and 94% for the 'old' member states. Yet for the 'new' member states the debt-to-GDP turning point is lower, namely between 53% and 54%. Therefore, we may conclude that the threshold value for the 'new' member states is lower than for the 'old' member states. In general, the research may contribute to a better understanding of the problem of high public debt and its effect on economic activity in the EU.","[Mencinger, Jernej; Aristovnik, Aleksander; Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Aristovnik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",aleksander.aristovnik@fu.uni-lj.si,"Aristovnik, Aleksander/B-4642-2010","Aristovnik, Aleksander/0000-0003-1345-9649",,,,,32,45,47,0,28,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,403,414,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300027,0

Thus far, few studies have developed comprehensive methodologies for the prioritisation of cycling infrastructure investments, and the role of end users has been underestimated in this process. The unique relationship that cyclists develop with the bicycle itself, their co-cyclists, bicycle facilities, and the urban environment as a result of sensory, kinaesthetic, symbolic, or even political reasons can assist in designing cycle facilities that are more efficient and closer to fulfilling the needs and desires of users. We propose a comprehensive four-step methodology for cycle network planning, which both accounts for the city structure and the zones in which higher cycling demand is possible and uses participative multicriteria GIS processes to incorporate cyclists' views with regard to choosing the cycle network segments. Our case study is Athens. Greece, where cycling facilities are few and heavily fragmented, although cycling demand has recently grown. This methodology may be useful for cities attempting to introduce and prioritise cycling infrastructures because it focuses on determining where cyclists would prefer to cycle to make such investments more successful in attracting users.

The consequences of a disruptions of riding times or the number of missed trips are analysed for each of the network links with a full scan approach implemented in GIS (Geographic Information Systems). Using real trips distribution, each link in the network is measured for criticality, from which the vulnerability of lines and stations can be calculated. The proposed methodology also makes it possible to analyse the role of circular lines in network vulnerability and to obtain a worst-case scenario for the successive disruption of links by simulating a targeted attack on the network. Results show the presence of critical links in the southern part of the network, where line density is low and ridership high. They also highlight the importance of the circular line as an element of network robustness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the two timespans let us compare the pre- and postadherence situations, in order to see if the subsidies offered by the EU have had any effect on the sustainability of the environment. The variables used have been of economic nature (index of real earnings), respectively related to the sustainable consumption of fish, all computed for one calendar year (total fish consumption, captures from inland waters, and aquaculture production). The results indicate significant correlations between total consumption and captures (r = .947 for the first and r = .990 for the second timespan), and between real earnings and consumption, respectively captures (only for the first timespan), but not significant correlations for the links between aquaculture and the rest of the variables.

In Greece, the impact of the recent economic crisis on growth, employment and income has led to a widespread decrease in salaries, an increase in the number of working hours and a dramatic increase in unemployment. One of the main reasons promoted was the country's high salaries' coupled with its low labour productivity. The purpose of the present work was to review the available data for labour productivity in Greece and to investigate changes in labour productivity which occurred during the recent economic crisis. Data was extracted from various national and international databases. The data presented in the present work indicate that for the first time in 2012 labour productivity in Greece exhibits a rising trend. Labour productivity can increase with training, motivation, commitment and rewards. It appears that during the period of the Banking crisis and a limited access to investment, including investment for technology, human resources management is a significant parameter for achieving increased competitiveness of the Greek economy.","[Anastasiou, S.] TEI Cent Greece, Dept Logist, Sch Business, Thebes, Greece; [Filippidis, K.] Univ Macedonia, Dept Balkan Studies, Florina, Greece; [Stergiou, K.] Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Primary Educ, Kozani, Greece",University of Western Macedonia,"Anastasiou, S (通讯作者)，TEI Cent Greece, Dept Logist, Sch Business, Thebes, Greece.",anastasiou@yahoo.com; kost_philip@hotmail.com; konstergiou@uowm.gr,"ANASTASIOU, SOPHIA/AAC-1668-2020","ANASTASIOU, SOPHIA/0000-0002-3874-5732",,,,,28,2,2,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,2100,2107,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300213,0

The comparison is based on calculations in a linear programming (LP) farm model supported with Stochastic Dominance with Respect to a Function (SDRF) for risk analysis. Mountain dairy farming involves free ranging cows on natural pastures for about 70 days. The contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids, CLA and various antioxidants in the milk increase when cows graze alpine pastures affecting its processing properties, and flavor and chemical content of dairy products. Seasonal mountain cheese production is found to be generally preferable to the other alternatives for risk neutral as well as risk-averse decision makers. This is due to a higher price for mountain products, subsidy payments for mountain farming, and exemption for farm processed milk in the national milk quota. The risks are partly price risks but also yield and output risks as well as downside political risks since the profitability depend strongly on subsidies and premiums, and exemption for farm-processed milk in the milk quota. Investments in farming co-operatives were unprofitable due to less subsidy payments compared to individual farmers. Effects of calving time, introducing fertilized pastures or night pens, and supplementary feeding to extend the mountain period and sustain milk yields are examined. The premium price for mountain products, animal welfare, and farmer co-operation on marketing are discussed.","[Asheim, Leif Jarle] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, N-0030 Oslo, Norway; [Lunnan, Tor; Sickel, Hanne] Bioforsk, Heggenes, Norway",Bioforsk,"Asheim, LJ (通讯作者)，Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, POB 8024, N-0030 Oslo, Norway.",Leif-Jarle.Asheim@nilf.no,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,5,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Since the economic crisis in 2008, economic conditions have degraded significantly across countries as reflected in particular rising of debt to GDP and rising of unemployment rates. This leaves space for the examination of the impact of these negative changes to the area of quality of life. There are numerous measurements which are focused on valuation of quality of life globally, but there are considerable differences in the methodology and results among them. Despite the diversity of the content of these indices, to the main components of examination we can include the economic, health, education and life expectancy of the population. Because of that the main aim of this article is to present findings of comparative study that explores selected well known indices measuring quality of life with main focus on Human Development Index and Legatum prosperity index. Based on the fact that those two indices have different content the results might differ. The main purpose is to compare differences of selected indices to point out the most significant indicators which influence the final results. We perform our research on a sample of EU countries out of which we focus mainly on V4 countries. Based on the results we present the most significant components of indices, which we closely research and by using statistical methods we search for potential dependence with selected macroeconomic indicators. Identification of these causes of these disparities and detection of weaknesses is the basis for the subsequent adoption of appropriate measures to develop these critical areas.

J,"Coughlin, CC",,,,"Coughlin, Cletus C.",,,The Great Trade Collapse and Rebound: A State-by-State View,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; CRISIS,"During the Great Trade Collapse in the United States, which began in late 2008, one concern was that such a large collapse would transform exporting firms into strictly domestic firms or, worse, drive them out of business. In either case, it was feared that U.S. exporting might, at best, revive slowly. However, this fear about long-lived export impacts did not materialize. Clearly there were large export effects, but the sharp decline was quickly followed by a sharp rebound that began in mid-2009. In contrast to previous research, this study examines this historic episode from the perspective of individual states. A comparison of intensive and extensive trade margins reveals that the adjustment occurred to a greater extent on the intensive than on the extensive trade margin. In other words, the adjustment process entailed relatively larger changes in average exports per firm than in the number of exporting firms. It is likely much easier to alter existing export levels than to, first, eliminate all exports by a firm and, second, either restart exports by this firm or become a new entrant into exporting.

Among Italian firms with 20 employees or more, an increasing share (from 7.1 to 13.2% between 2006 and 2011) owns a foreign productive unit. Nearly half of such units were located in developing countries. The main reason for locating units in advanced countries is to be close to outlet markets, this remains true for internationalization in developing countries even though in this case the search for lower costs becomes more important. In line with empirical research based on data from several countries, Italian multinationals are on average more productive and profitable, even when compared to exporting firms not operating abroad. More specifically, the productivity gap compared to these latter firms is 15 percent, closely aligned with that measured by Helpman at al. (2004) on a sample of US firms. In the years 2007-2012, internationalized firms' operating profit, as well as their labor utilization in Italy, were above both the general average and that of other exporting firms. In firms' opinion, the support by Italian public institutions to expand their foreign activity is generally not effective. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To test our hypothesis, we use the tracking portfolio approach of Lamont (2001) to capture news about future persistent exchange-rate movements. We find empirical evidence that supports our hypothesis, which has important implications for both international finance and empirical asset pricing. For international finance, our evidence provides an alternative explanation for the exposure puzzle and suggests researchers focus on persistent, instead of contemporaneous, exchange-rate movements. For empirical asset pricing, our findings imply a fresh and plausible perspective of exchange-rate risk, a state variable underlying the Fama-French factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier By.

Taking the Nordic countries as a baseline many European countries have adopted strong social protection programs to maintain the quality of life for their citizens. However, given the costs that come with these social benefits, there arises the question whether people truly thrive in the welfare state or are they better off without it. The objective of this research is to provide empirical evidence for the existence of a non-linear relationship between social expenditure and life satisfaction. Based on the happiness economics literature, the current paper distinguishes itself by examining the connection between life satisfaction, as a proxy for wellbeing, and social expenditure. Additionally, based on the hypothesis that countries seek out to maintain life satisfaction in periods of unfavorable economic conditions through increases in social expenditure, we calculate the optimal level of debt cost that should be supported by the respective countries. We test on a sample of 15 European countries on a time span of ten years and our findings suggest that there is a non-linear relationship between life satisfaction and social expenditure. Moreover, countries have been increasing their debt levels over an optimal level to fuel social expenses in order to maintain citizens' life satisfaction.","[Dumbraveanu, Andrada] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,dumbraveanu.andrada@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,134,142,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000018,0

It aims to identify what volume of movement at the airports associates with positive net earnings, i.e. the break-even point between revenue and expenditure, in view of aspects of airport movement and geographical factors. It examines airports serving regular airlines and with movement of up to 8 million passengers in 2010. Revenues and expenditures are explained by total passengers embarked and disembarked at each airport and by the potential of the airport's 'anchor city'. Multiple regression analysis achieved a high level of explanation for the dependent variables studied, i.e., revenues and expenditures. The model explains 81% and 91% of the variations in revenues and expenditures, respectively. The analysis shows that, considering the ranking of cities, Brazilian airports with less than 2 million passengers tend to operate at a financial loss, those with between 2 and 3 million passengers are at the transition stage between positive and negative earnings, while airports with more than 3 million passengers tend to make gains. However, the simulation modelling shows that the break-even point between expenditure and revenue functions can vary considerably when different 'city potentials' are considered. In this respect, the modelling offers investors a tool for analyzing passenger demand risk in the light of expectations for Brazilian cities' potential. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Since both the government and its creditors are likely to benefit from such restructurings, we label these episodes as voluntary debt exchanges. We present a model in which voluntary debt exchanges can occur in equilibrium when the debt level takes values above the one that maximizes the market value of debt claims. In contrast to previous studies on debt overhang, in our model opportunities for voluntary exchanges arise because a debt reduction implies a decline of the sovereign default risk. This is observed in the absence of any effect of debt reductions on future output levels. Although voluntary exchanges are Pareto improving at the time of the restructuring, we show that eliminating the possibility of conducting voluntary exchanges may improve welfare from an ex ante perspective. Thus, our results highlight a cost of initiatives that facilitate debt restructurings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By constructing a political economy model in which the formation of lobby groups and environmental policy are endogenously determined, we show that unilateral tariff reductions by a large country importing a polluting good will generate a lobby group with a relatively lower cost of organization in a small country exporting that good. A formulated lobby demands an inefficient environmental policy, and hence, the small country's environmental regulations become less efficient. Then, we show that when a lobby already exists, unilateral tariff reductions result in the formation of a rival lobby and consequently make the small country's environmental policy more efficient.","Rissho Univ, Fac Econ, Shinagawa Ku, Tokyo 1418602, Japan",,"Kawahara, S (通讯作者)，Rissho Univ, Fac Econ, Shinagawa Ku, 4-2-16 Osaki, Tokyo 1418602, Japan.",kawahara@ris.ac.jp,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In the meantime, it is noticed that the trade shows and exhibition industry has experienced a rapid growth. Trade shows are considered as a vital communication technique for those companies that operate in international markets. Making them an integral part of the marketing communication strategy in turbulence periods enables companies in: developing customer relationships; offering possibilities for sales and sales promotion; undertaking and maintaining good international business relations; monitoring international competition, as well as, minimizing entry barriers in new markets. During the last 5 years, trade shows usage has increased considerably even in Albania. Companies operating in different industries meet their competitors and their target markets in specific trade shows every year. But, it is important to mention the fact that even though trade shows usage is increasing constantly, research on its effectiveness is still limited. The aim of this paper is to study the effectiveness of marketing communication techniques. More specifically, it is focused in studying the usage of trade shows as a strategic marketing tool in competing in international markets. For this reason there were chosen two Albanian based companies that operate solely in foreign markets: FPM Albania and Henry ltd. Both companies focus their communication strategies in international markets solely on trade shows, which facilitated the process of evaluating the effectiveness of this marketing technique on variables such as sales, international business contacts, market research, etc. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Data collected from 185 poultry firms of South India form the empirical base. A significant share of broiler firms were found using amino acids in quantities above the recommended levels with negligible production and negative profitability effects, demonstrating a clear dearth of managerial skill to obtain and utilize information on poultry nutrition. A linear programming model for estimating the least-cost feed formulation showed that the potential economic impact of biofortified maize is limited by the availability of low-cost protein from the alternative sources, and that the potential cost savings from the technology would be marginal. Similar findings were obtained from additional estimation done by relaxing the assumption that the firms have perfect information on feed formulation. Also, lack of awareness of the small-scale firm management regarding poultry nutrition could pose additional challenges in the development of innovative maize-poultry value chains for diffusion of this innovation.","[Krishna, Vijesh V.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Erenstein, Olaf] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico; [Sadashivappa, Prakash] Tata Consultancy Serv, Subject Matter Expert, Bangalore 560060, Karnataka, India; [Vivek, B.

To resolve this question, This paper analysises the effects of no-target consumers brand usage on brand attitude from the perspective of brand dilution with an experiment, and the results indicate that:(1)different kinds of no-target consumers brand usage have different effects in the brand attitude of target consumers: the brand consumption of aspiration group doesn't affect target consumers' brand attitude, while neutral group and dissociative group have negative effects on consumers' brand attitude; (2)and self-construct moderates the effects: for target consumers of interdependent self-construal, neutral group and dissociative group's brand usage will bring negative effects on their brand attitude, while aspiration group doesn't; for target consumers of independent self-construal, aspiration group's brand usage has positive effects on their brand attitude, while other out-group doesn't.","[Liu Hong-yan; Wei Wei] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Liu, HY (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",,"LIU, Haotian/T-8010-2019",,,,,,21,2,2,0,1,ASIAN BUSINESS ASSOC,CENTRL HONG KONG,"9 FLR, ANTNA TOWER, 148 DES VOEUX RD, CENTRL HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2357-190X,2357-1918,,P CHIN MARK INT CONF,,,2014,,,,,,,611,628,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359385500066,0

We make two contributions to the empirical policy analysis literature. First, we argue that UQR provides more policy-relevant information than conventional quantile regression in most empirical state policy analyses. Second, we document cigarette tax elasticity across a sample of adult smokers in the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplements between 1992 and 2011. Our ordinary least squares regression show an imprecise negative relationship between taxes and cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days, while UQR reveals a U-shaped relationship: Only moderate smokers reduce their smoking following a cigarette tax increase, and the magnitude of the effect is small. A $1.00 (135 percent) increase in the cigarette tax leads to a 3.5 percent reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days among the most responsive smokers (implied tax elasticity = -0.03).

Based on this research, an Alarm System of Sirens, together with a Monitoring System of Rain (pluviometers), was installed in 103 communities. At the Rio Operations Center a team of meteorologists work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, doing rain forecast and monitoring. A Meteorological Radar reaching 250km makes the forecast and 83 pluviometers installed at the communities monitor the rain. If the rain reaches a critical level, what can cause accidents, the sirens are activated to warn the population about the risk of sliding and residents are oriented to move to safer places. The Municipal Civil Defense has identified places which can temporarily shelter these residents in the period of heavy rains. Therefore, indoor courts, residents' associations, churches, schools and other establishments located at or near the communities, are the support points for receiving these residents. Several Simulated Evacuation Exercises have been organized to train and adapt, in a concrete way and as close to reality as possible, the residents of the areas at risk for their evacuation in an emergency situation. These trainings are also a great opportunity of exercising and evaluating the work of the people involved in the activation of sirens and opening of the support points, as well as stimulating the participation of volunteers and increasing the risk perception of the residents. This way, and complementing with integrated, fast and efficient actions of answer and reconstruction, the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro can become a Resilient City, to the heavy rains and to the disasters, and therewith, gain capacity to face, adapt and absorb the impacts of these types of occurrences and restore the normality as soon as it is possible.

The growing body of knowledge in this research stream posits that creating pleasant experiences to customers while they are actively engaging with the products or services at every touch points in the retail setting, retailers can exploit these happy customers to feel emotionally attached and bonded with the retail store. If retailer attempt to create exceptionally enjoyable shopping experience, undoubtedly it is imperative to identify the predictors of shoppers' experience. In respond to this notion, hence the main objective of this research is to assess the effect of store atmospherics on shoppers' hedonic experience and in turn store loyalty. A framework was developed and tested in the context of a very popular chain bookstore in Malaysia, that is MPH. Shoppers' hedonic experience is hypothesized to be influenced by three elements of store atmosphere, namely store design, ambient and social factors. Subsequently, it was hypothesized that hedonic experience has positive effect on store loyalty. The research findings unveil that there was no evidence to support the hypothesized links between ambient factors with shoppers' hedonic experience. Interestingly, however it was discovered that store design and social factors have significant influence on the shoppers' hedonic experience. In addition, it was found that shoppers' hedonic experience has positive influence on store loyalty. Therefore, the research findings reaffirms that retailers should pay attention to consumers' in-store emotional state as the emotions of consumers are determining factors in formation of experience quality. Implications of the research findings to the body of knowledge and retail management practices were discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Leveraging on the proposed unifying lens, a cross-sectional dataset from a survey of 230 cattle farmers in the Okhahlamba Local Municipality is employed in the analysis of a Double Hurdle model. In line with the transaction cost hypothesis, the preliminary results suggest that education and cattle productivity influence positively the decision to participate in cattle markets, and given positive decision, the supply volume increases with proximity to rural towns. Vindicating the store-of-wealth hypothesis, the results also show a negative effect of access to water sources on the market participation decision, coupled with a positive and negative effects of cattle productivity and expected price, respectively, on supply volumes.

Using quarterly and monthly data covering the period from January 1987 to December 2010, the regression results show that KLCI excess returns are statistically related to change in lending interest rate, exchange rate, money supply and industrial production index. Recursive predictions derived from the optimal regression models are only capable of correctly predicting the positive signs of actual excess returns, whereas the forecasting accuracy of actual negative returns is very low, especially under quarterly trading basis. The results also indicate that the market timing strategy constructed on the basis of the recursive predictions only dominate the naive buy-and-hold strategy in monthly trading frequencies.","[Nguyen Thi Tuyet Nhung; Nguyen Thi Bich Loan; Bui Duc Nha] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University,,nguyenthituyetnhung@tdt.edu.vn,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,2,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,528,551,,,,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200039,0

The heterogeneity in expectations can lead to market instability and complicate dynamics of prices, which are driven by endogenous market forces. In this sense, we use Agent-based computational approach and more specifically artificial Stock Market modeling to explore the market dynamics from a behavioral perspective. Our aim is to point out that the investors' irrationality explains various numbers of financial anomalies, especially the phenomena that traditional financials models have never been able to explain. We built a virtual financial market that contains three types of investors: fundamentalists, non-fundamentalist and loss adverse investors. Therefore, the difficulty of the prediction is due to several features: the complexity, the non-linearity and the dynamism of the financial market system, as well as the investor psychology. The Artificial Neural Networks learning mechanism take on the role of traders, who from their futures return expectations and place orders based on their expectations.

Organic fertilizers improve poor and acid mountain soils, by organic substance and alkalinity, with minimum costs and the economic effect of maintaining the floral structure and the valuable biodiversity. In 7-8 years of interrupting this process, the natural flora starts to turn wild again, by being invaded by worthless plants. At the level of family farms an important resource of biological nitrogen is wasted and it also becomes harmful factor for animals, humans and the environment - Purina. Good management of organic fertilizer and hays - turns into economic resource and factor for guaranteeing the high quality of agri-food mountain products, obtained in the absence of chemicals and in a clean environment.

In the first step, the possible relationship between the value of intellectual capital, using the VAIC (TM) (Pulic, 2000, 2004) as a measure of efficiency, and business performance measured by classical indicators present in literature (ROI, ROE and ROS) was investigated, and then the relationship between the VAIC (TM) and Market to book value (M/BV) was measured, given that the results produced by the literature appear discordant. In the second step, the sample was reordered by taking into account the VAIC ranking and a second linear regression was performed in order to verify whether the relationship was statistically more robust than the previous one. Lastly, the sample was divided into two high and low VAIC portfolios, respectively; then the calculation of the average yields was performed and a test was carried out on the difference between the means of the two portfolios. From the results obtained there would appear to be a positive and statistically significant difference between the two portfolios: the high VAIC portfolio outperforms the low VAIC portfolio.","[Rossi, Fabrizio] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Cassino, FR, Italy; [Celenza, Domenico] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Cassino, FR, Italy",University of Cassino; University of Cassino,"Rossi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Cassino, FR, Italy.",f.rossi@unicas.it; d.celenza@unicas.it,,,,,,,47,1,1,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,168,178,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000021,0

It seems that pertaining to the task of appointing a chairperson, as for the division of labor, the use of the formality variable may explain the compliance of the structured virtual team members as opposed to the lack of compliance among members of the structured non-virtual team members.

In Kazakhstan direct partnerships between universities and business entities are rare and not very well developed. This paper studies the attitudes of telecommunications companies towards knowledge collaboration with universities and outlines the factors hindering university-industry collaboration. The discussion builds on data collected via self-administered questionnaires and face-to-face interviews with the representatives of 28 telecommunications companies. The findings reveal how these opinions depend on size and origin of businesses. This study makes a contribution by exploring this issue in the case of an emerging economy (Kazakhstan) and provides policy advice on the development of government strategies to foster such university-industry partnerships.

Government proposed Act as a response to fast growing illiquidity and insolvency. Years of irresponsible business operations brought many enterprises to the edge. There were two excuses for bringing Act. First one objected that most of enterprises are in situation where regular bankruptcy would lead to cessation of business. Second was connected to first one, stating that bankruptcy means loss of work places. Idea was to allow debtors to continue business by reprogramming and writing-off of part of debt with consent from majority of creditors. Financial and operating restructuring plan, a key part of pre-bankruptcy settlement, sets how enterprise will operate and what is necessary for continuation of business. However, by accepting plan, creditors agree that some of their claims will not be settled. Therefore, Act approves non-payment of some of the debts, directly damaging creditors and other enterprises that pay on time.

Prominent among these is quantitative easing (QE) the purchase of a large quantity of longer-term debt on the assumption that it will reduce long-term yields through the portfolio balance channel. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and others suggest that QE works through the portfolio balance channel, which implies a strong, statistically significant positive relationship between the public's holding of long-term Treasury debt and long-term Treasury yields. The author uses the econometric approach of Gagnon et al. (2011) and others to investigate the relationship between a variety of measures of the public's debt holding and various yield measures in the literature.

It develops a strategy which divides economic and social aspects in delivering its activities of business. The performance of social entrepreneurship is measured economically as it applies the resource utilization exploitatively and desire-based.

The models are applied to a comprehensive sample of firms that have been subject to enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly misstating their financial statements between 1982 and 2005. The results suggest that while maintaining a comparable Type-I error, out-of-sample predictions of the Bayesian models improve in terms of sensitivity and the Type-II error.

One of the highly growth markets at present is the Halal packaged food industry. Even though several studies have focused on the purchase of Halal products produced by Non-Muslim manufacturer, however their results are still inconclusive. Thus, this study aims to investigate the determinant factors that consumers may consider in buying Halal packaged food produced by Non-Muslim manufacturers. Halal awareness, Islamic brand and product ingredients are used as the pre-determined factors in measuring consumer's purchase intention. A total of 150 set of questionnaires were distributed randomly in Klang Valley. The hypotheses which were tested using Pearson Correlation have revealed that Halal awareness and product ingredients have significantly influenced Muslim's intention to buy Halal packaged food that are produced by Non-Muslim manufacturers. It is expected that the findings of this study will assist the Non-Muslim's Halal certified manufacturers to develop the best strategy in winning the heart of Muslim consumers.","[Yunus, Nor Sara Nadia Muhamad; Ariffin, Norafifa Mohd; Rashid, Norhidayah Mohd] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Bandar Puncak Alam 42300, Selangor, Malaysia; [Rashid, Wan Edura Wan] Univ Teknol MARA, Inst Business Excellence, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,,norsara2711@salam.uitm.edu.my,"WAN RASHID, WAN EDURA/IXW-9960-2023","Wan Rashid, Wan Edura/0000-0002-3344-6485",,,,,28,31,32,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1877-0428,,,PROCD SOC BEHV,,,2014,130.0,,,,,,145,154,,10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.04.018,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB7EU,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345439600018,0

The natural experiment provides an opportunity to examine two classic questions related to incentives and risk-how boards adjust incentives in response to firms' risk and how these incentives affect managers' risk-taking. We find that, after left-tail risk increases, boards reduce managers' exposure to stock price movements and that less convexity from options-based pay leads to greater risk-reducing activities. Specifically, managers with less convex payoffs tend to cut leverage and R&D, stockpile cash, and engage in more diversifying acquisitions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As conditions deteriorate, cross exposures generate the possibility of a domino effect of bankruptcies. As this happens, banks face an increasingly complex environment since they need to understand a greater fraction of the financial network to assess their own financial health. Complexity dramatically amplifies banks' perceived counterparty risk, and makes relatively healthy banks reluctant to buy risky assets.

With the purpose of analysing the selection of heterogeneous firms into different internationalisation patterns, we jointly model the decisions on the forms of internationalisation through a multivariate probit. This model allows us to avoid any a priori assumption about the firm's behaviour. In this context we study the complementarity/ substitutability relationships between forms of internationalisation. The results obtained show that: (i) neglecting some forms could lead to an incomplete representation about the firm's internationalisation strategy, (ii) different firm's characteristics influence the choice of internationalisation pattern, i. e. some types of firm are more prone to choosing one type of process over another, (iii) complementarity between forms of internationalisation seems to be preferred over substitution, but some heterogeneity also arises in this context.","[Calia, Pinuccia; Ferrante, Maria Rosaria] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy",University of Bologna,"Ferrante, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy.",pinuccia.calia@unibo.it; maria.ferrante@unibo.it,"CALIA, PINUCCIA PASQUALINA/AAT-5111-2020","CALIA, PINUCCIA PASQUALINA/0000-0002-6638-4081; ferrante, maria/0000-0001-9813-2420",,,,,51,9,9,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We differentiate between two types of leverage ratios: book leverage and market leverage. We show that market leverage instead of book leverage observed before the crisis has statistically and economically significant predictive power for the cross-sectional variation in bank performance during the crisis, even after controlling for a variety of other indicators reflecting bank's characteristics and financial conditions. We also find that banks with lower market leverage ratios were affected more adversely by the failure announcements of large financial institutions during the crisis. The results are robust across alternative model specifications, statistical methodologies, lengths of sample intervals, and measures of bank share performance during the crisis. Our results therefore have important implications for regulators in identifying distressed banks that are vulnerable to the deterioration in conditions of the financial system. J. Japanese Int.

Large bank returns are favorably affected by increases in implied market volatility during the crisis, while small banks are adversely affected by increases in implied market volatility. We attribute the different effects among the size-categorized bank portfolios to the perception that large banks are protected by too-big-to-fail policies. Within the sample of small banks, the adverse share price response to increased implied market volatility is more pronounced for banks that rely more heavily on non-traditional sources of funds, use a high proportion of loans in their assets, have a higher level of non-performing assets, and have a relatively low provision for loan losses. The adverse effect of negative innovations in implied market volatility on small bank returns during the crisis is primarily driven by exposure of their loan portfolio to weak economic conditions.

The use of intraday data permits us to examine the direct impact of these events, and the length of time the market takes to incorporate this information with a higher degree of precision than the research currently on offer. The study is framed within an event study methodology, with a number of robustness measures: a matched sample approach; analysis of cross-sectional determinants; the removal of penny stocks; and, procedures to account for sample selection bias. We find significant share price reversals following a query announcement, with a reversal of 33% by the end of the widest event interval.

Moreover, prior to liberalization, the number (concentration) of stocks available in the market is negatively (positively) correlated with the pricing of idiosyncratic risk. The decrease in the pricing of idiosyncratic risk can explain the reduction in the cost of capital around liberalizations.

Using a logit approach to predicting banking crises in 14 OECD countries we find a significant impact of a proxy for the ratio of banks' off-balance-sheet activity to total (off and on balance sheet) activity, as well as capital and liquidity ratios, the current account balance and GDP growth. These results are robust to the exclusion of the most crisis prone countries in our model. For early warning purposes we show that real house price growth is a good proxy for off balance sheet activity prior to the sub-prime episode. Variables capturing off-balance sheet activity have been neglected in most early warning models to date. We consider it essential that regulators take into account the results for crisis prediction in regulating banks and their off-balance sheet exposures, and thus controlling their contribution to systemic risk.

The present paper investigates this link using a laboratory experiment. In the experiment, public officials have the opportunity to accept a bribe and can then decide between a neutral and a corrupt action. The corrupt action benefits the briber but poses a large negative externality on a charity. The results show that increasing public officials' wages greatly reduces their corruptibility. In particular, low-wage public officials accept 91% of bribes on average, whereas high-wage public officials accept 38%. Moreover, high-wage public officials are less likely to choose the corrupt option. Additionally, the results suggest that a positive monitoring rate may be necessary for these effects to arise.

Using state antitakeover laws as an exogenous measure of variation in takeover vulnerability, I investigate whether product market competition has a disciplinary effect that can lower a firm's cost of bank loans. After taking into account the industry composition of borrowers, I find that banks charge higher spreads to borrowers that are vulnerable to takeovers, but only in concentrated industries. In the absence of disciplinary competitive pressure, the effect of takeover vulnerability on the cost of bank loans is mitigated for larger firms, firms followed by analysts, firms with existing credit ratings, non-family firms, and for borrowers with shorter maturity loans or loans with covenants and collateral in place. Taken together, the results suggest that the effect of governance on the cost of financing is not homogenous across all industries, and that concentrated industry firms may need to use supplementary governance mechanisms to mitigate debt holder agency problems.

The optimal insurance contract takes the form of a system of implicit deductibles, resulting in the same indemnities as a contract with full insurance above a variable deductible positively related to the elasticity of medical expenditures with respect to the insurance rate. In a model with a predefined ceiling on expenses, there is no reimbursement for expenses below the stop-loss amount. One motivation to have some insurance below the deductible arises if regular health care expenditures in a situation of standard health have a negative effect on the probability of getting into a state with large medical expenses.","[Dreze, Jacques H.; Schokkaert, Erik] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Schokkaert, Erik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; KU Leuven,"Schokkaert, E (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Louvain, Belgium.",Erik.Schokkaert@kuleuven.be,,"Schokkaert, Erik/0000-0003-0981-3449",,,,,26,13,13,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

It finds that more active as well as more consistent communication by committee members improves the predictability of monetary policy decisions significantly. This effect is sizeable as communication dispersion across committee members accounts on average for one third to one half of the market's prediction errors of FOMC policy decisions. Moreover, more active and more consistent communication are found to also reduce the degree of uncertainty about the future path of interest rates.

However, studies that investigate the influence of family ownership on small business growth remain scarce and suffer from several shortcomings. To remedy these shortcomings, this paper uses a very large sample of French SMEs to explore the relationship between family ownership and small business growth. First, this study shows that there is a negative, although non-monotonic, relationship between family ownership and small business economic growth. Second, it explores the channel through which family ownership affects firm growth. Results suggest that firms with greater family ownership are prone to below-potential rates of economic growth, given their internal financing resources. Overall, the results suggest that small family businesses have a propensity to deliberately limit their growth (i.e., they adopt conservative growth behavior).","[Hamelin, Anais] EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LaRGE, F-67082 Strasbourg, France; [Hamelin, Anais] Univ Strasbourg, F-67082 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Hamelin, A (通讯作者)，EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LaRGE, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",Anais.hamelin@unistra.fr,"Hamelin, Anais/AFL-2951-2022","Hamelin, Anais/0000-0001-6530-5487",,,,,73,31,34,3,100,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The GARCH-jump model can capture the behavior of asset prices more appropriately given its consistency with abundant empirical findings that discontinuities in the sample path of financial asset prices still being found even allowing for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity. With our lattice model, it shows that both the GARCH and jump effects in the GARCH-jump model are negative for near-the-money options, while positive for in-the-money and out-of-the-money options. In addition, even when the GARCH model is considered, the jump process impedes the early exercise and thus reduces the percentage of the early exercise premium of American options, particularly for shorter-term horizons. Moreover, the interaction between the GARCH and jump processes can raise the percentage proportions of the early exercise premiums for shorter-term horizons, whereas this effect weakens when the time to maturity increases.","[Lin, Bing-Huei] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Hung, Mao-Wei; Wang, Jr-Yan; Wu, Ping-Da] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University; National Taiwan University,"Wang, JY (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",linbh@dragon.nchu.edu.tw; hung@management.ntu.edu.tw; jywang@management.ntu.edu.tw; charly.wu@msa.hinet.net,,,,,,,39,4,4,2,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

We find significantly negative risk premiums when realized variance is computed from intraday data with low frequency. As a likely consequence of microstructure effects however, the evidence is ambiguous when realized variance is based on high-frequency data. Common to all estimates, variance risk premiums are highly time-varying and inversely related to the risk-neutral expectation of future variance. When we test whether variance risk premiums can be attributed to classic risk factors or fear of jump risk, we find that conditional premiums remain significantly negative. However, we observe a strong relationship between the size of log variance risk premiums and the VIX, the TED spread and the general shape of the implied volatility function of the corresponding currency pair.

In contrast to the view of Gordon (1992) small countries appear to be the leader of the tax competition game.","[Devereux, Michael P.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Univ Ctr BusinessTaxat, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Loretz, Simon] Univ Oxford, Oxford Univ Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England; [Loretz, Simon] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Bayreuth,"Devereux, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Univ Ctr BusinessTaxat, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England.",Michael.Devereux@sbs.ox.uk; Simon.Loretz@bayreuth.de,,"Loretz, Simon/0000-0002-7117-1531",,,,,120,51,55,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Through the use of stock market data and credit default swap (CDS) spreads, this paper examines investors' reaction to Lehman's collapse in an attempt to identify a spillover effect on the surviving financial institutions. The empirical analysis indicates that (i) the collateral damage was limited to the largest financial firms; (ii) the institutions most affected were the surviving non-bank financial services firms; and (iii) the negative effect was correlated with the financial conditions of the surviving institutions. We also detect significant abnormal jumps in CDS spreads that we interpret as evidence of sudden upward revisions in the market assessment of future default probabilities assigned to the surviving financial firms.

We analyze this question using the collapse of India's equity market in 1997, which provides an exogenous shock to firms' ability to issue equity. We find that both public and private firms exhibit higher bankruptcy rates and lower growth after 1997. The decline in growth is greater among firms with more external finance needs and fewer tangible assets.

This model subjects the short-term interest rate to monetary regime shifts, specifically a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and normal regimes, which depend on macroeconomic variables. The estimates show that under the ZIRP regime, the effect of deflation (inflation) on lowering (raising) bond yields amplifies on the long end of yield curves, compared with a case with positive interest rates under the normal regime.

The stock's contribution to the asymmetry and the fat tails of the market portfolio's payoff are priced into a coskewness premium and a cokurtosis premium. We construct zero-investment strategies that are long and short in coskewness and cokurtosis equity risks; we infer from the spread the returns attached to a unit exposure to US equity coskewness and cokurtosis. The coskewness and cokurtosis premiums present positive monthly average returns of 0.27% and 0.14% from January 1959 to December 2011. Comoment risks appear to be significantly priced within the US stock market and display significant explanatory power regarding the US size and book-to-market effects. The premiums do not subsume, but rather complement the empirical capital asset pricing model. Our analysis relies on data collected from CRSP (Chicago Research Center for Security Prices) over December 1955 to December 2011. To our knowledge, the paper is the first to propose investable higher-moment risk factors over such an extensive time period. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our simulations indicate that common price discovery metrics - Hasbrouck information share and Harris-McInish-Wood component share - are only consistent with this view of price discovery if the price series have equal levels of noise, including microstructure frictions and liquidity. If the noise in the price series differs, the information and component shares measure a combination of leadership in impounding new information and relative avoidance of noise, to varying degrees. A third price discovery metric the 'information leadership share' uses the information share and the component share together to identify the price series that is first to impound new information. This third metric is robust to differences in noise levels and therefore correctly attributes price discovery in a wider range of settings. Using four recent empirical studies of price discovery we show that the choice and interpretation of price discovery metrics can have a substantial impact on conclusions about price discovery.

In comparison to the baseline of either doing nothing or the optimality of an externality-correcting tax, a discriminatory reverse auction and two screening contracts are tested. In limited budget situations, the auction achieved the lowest social surplus, while screening contracts that rely upon the government observing the development value yield the highest relative social surplus.

Using over 2.5 million observations for 600.000 firms in 8 euro area countries in the period 1993-2009, we show that firms use the trade credit channel to manage growth. In countries where the trade credit channel is more present, the marginal impact is lower, but the total impact is still higher. Further, firms that are more vulnerable to financial market imperfections, rely more on the trade credit channel to manage growth.

We show that large pharmaceutical companies have adopted a blockbuster model in an effort to maximize shareholder value, which is explained by various factors including financialization, technical change, product market regulations, and market competition. The stock market is used to make large acquisitions and control the US drug market, creating a growing dependency on stock performance and blockbuster drug sales.

This paper uses data from the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey to examine if students who have received school-based HIV instruction behave differently than those who have not. To address potentially endogenous exposure to HIV education, this paper considers a propensity score matching approach. Findings from the propensity score analysis suggest that standard ordinary least squares results are biased. Despite this, there remains some evidence that exposure to HIV education decreases risky sexual activity. Among male students, HIV education is also negatively related to the rate of using needles to inject illegal drugs into the body. The needle use results are robust to a sensitivity analysis, while the results for sexual behaviors are not.

I estimate the willingness to pay to live in a high-income suburb, above and beyond the demand of wealthy neighbors, by measuring changes in housing prices across city-suburban borders as the income disparity between the two municipalities changes over time. I find that a $10,000 increase in town-level median income is associated with a seven percent increase in housing values at the border. The estimated demand for high-income municipalities is primarily driven by school quality and lower property tax rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This is in contrast to financial market-based variables that almost never have out-of-sample forecasting power. Using the stock return predictability that we uncover, we find that international versions of conditional asset pricing models perform well.

We confirm the hypothesis using a sample of UK public-to-private transactions over the period 1997-2003. A post going private performance analysis reveals that both management buyouts and private equity backed deals outperform their industry peers. However, private equity backed deals outperform their peers already before the deal takes place whereas management buyouts improve performance afterwards.

Increasing the efficiency of transportation systems alone will not solve these problems and may exacerbate them.

This paper discusses the role of sensed transportation, geographic information science and social media to cultivate transportation systems where participants share, cooperate and act collectively to solve operational, tactical and strategic mobility and accessibility problems. This paper also provides a vision of the future by imaging a seamless multi-modal transportation system combined with a virtual environment where data streams are fused, interpreted and made available with tools for human engagement and shared decision making.

Based on a logistic regression model using municipal-level employment data (1993-2008), it aims at assessing whether municipalities with small amounts of employment are likely to experience high employment growth depending on their location vis-A-vis transport infrastructures. Motorways are found to have an influence for very small areas and airports for bigger ones.

According to the literature we find that market liquidity is impaired when stock markets decline, implying a positive relation between market and liquidity risk. Moreover, this relationship is the stronger the deeper one digs into the order book. Even more interestingly, this paper sheds further light on so far puzzling features of market liquidity: liquidity commonality and flight-to-quality. We show that liquidity commonality varies over time, increases during market downturns, peaks at major crisis events and becomes weaker the deeper we look into the limit order book. Consistent with recent theoretical models that argue for a spiral effect between the financial sector's funding liquidity and an asset's market liquidity, we find that funding liquidity tightness induces an increase in liquidity commonality which then leads to market-wide liquidity dry-ups. Therefore our findings corroborate the view that market liquidity can be a driving force for financial contagion. Finally, we show that there is a positive relationship between credit risk and liquidity risk, i.e., there is a spread between liquidity costs of high and low credit quality stocks, and that in times of increased market uncertainty the impact of credit risk on liquidity risk intensifies. This corroborates the existence of a flight-to-quality or flight-to-liquidity phenomenon also on the stock markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that BDPs are relevant to only a minority of entrepreneurs. This can be explained by variations in household vulnerability and entrepreneurial ambition.

We find that the median fall in wealth among individuals was 8 per cent of total household gross wealth with, on average, richer individuals having experienced a larger decline.

Liquidity increases the likelihood of block formation. Conditional upon acquiring a stake, liquidity reduces the likelihood that the blockholder governs through voice (intervention)-as shown by the lower propensity for active investment (filing Schedule 13D) than passive investment (filing Schedule 13G). The lower frequency of activism does not reflect the abandonment of governance, but governance through the alternative channel of exit (selling one's shares): A 13G filing leads to positive announcement returns and improvements in operating performance, especially in liquid firms. Moreover, taking into account the increase in block formation, liquidity has an unconditional positive effect on voice as well as exit.

This study deals with the effects of immigration on firm exports. Can firms benefit from hiring immigrants to expand their export sales? Or do immigrants who live in the firm's region affect trade? In contrast to the existing literature, we are able to distinguish these two distinct channels. Using matched employer-employee data from Denmark for the years 1995-2005, we provide novel insights in the nexus between exports and immigration. We further contribute to the literature by providing first evidence on the adjustment of firms' product portfolio in response to immigration. Our empirical results are consistent with the claim that immigration lowers barriers to trade. Both, regional immigration and foreign employment matter for the composition of firm-level exports. As a novel insight, our findings suggest that firms benefit from immigration in terms of expanded export sales, when they hire foreign employees. We only find weak evidence for the local presence of foreigners to increase export sales, which we ascribe to the conjecture that at least some trade-cost reducing forces of immigration like for example intercultural knowledge or personal and business networks abroad, can only be accessed or exploited via foreign employment.","[Hiller, Sanne] Univ Luneburg, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Hiller, Sanne] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, DK-8230 Aabyhoj, Denmark",Leuphana University Luneburg; Aarhus University,"Hiller, S (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",shiller@leuphana.de,,,,,,,59,36,40,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

First, it examines the global macroeconomic linkages among the dollar exchange rate, oil price, China's producer price, U.S.'s export price, EU's export price and Japan's export price. Second, it investigates the effects of global and country-specific shocks on the industrial production and consumer price indices of these GCC member countries and the potential member Jordan. It thereby examines which individual global/local shocks command more importance in explaining the variations in the economic growth and inflation of each actual and potential GCC member. Third, it analyzes the similarities in economic growth and inflation among the GCC countries after controlling for different global and country-specific shocks. The results suggest that the overall CPI inflation rates of Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Jordan are highly and positively correlated. The economic growth of Jordan shows negative correlations with those of the member countries. If the GCC members are to focus only on stabilizing inflation, there is no harm for them to accept Jordan as a new GCC member. However, if the GCC's objective is not only the stabilization of inflation but also the business cycle synchronization, the GCC members should be more cautious in accepting Jordan as a new member.

One sector (the agrarian) produces a homogeneous good, and the other (the modern) produces a vertically differentiated product. The modern sector is segmented according to quality: high-quality varieties are produced by formal firms which employ only adult labor, whereas low-quality varieties are produced by informal firms which employ child labor as well. Differences in tastes and incomes across households generate demand for both high-quality and low-quality varieties. Stricter enforcement of child-labor regulations and increases in minimum wages can have beneficial effects regarding the incidence of child labor and the size of the formal sector. However, since these policies have undesirable welfare effects among segments of wage-earning households, they may not garner the necessary political support.","[Moutos, Thomas] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Moutos, T (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, 76 Patiss Str, Athens 10434, Greece.",tmoutos@aueb.gr,"Moutos, Thomas/AAE-2552-2022",,,,,,31,3,3,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In this paper, we reconsider the link between relationship lending and firm growth, distinguishing firms by size and expansion/contraction conditions. The idea is that the beneficial effects of relationship lending on information asymmetries can be compensated by other negative capture, risk, and externality effects which make relational banks reluctant to support long-term growth projects of client firms, and that the strength of these compensating effects varies with firm size and health status. We explore the influence of long-lasting bank relationships on employment and asset growth of a large sample of Italian firms. The main finding is that relationship lending hampers the efforts of small firms to increase their size, while it mitigates the negative growth of troubled, medium-large enterprises.","[Gambini, Alessandro] Univ Politecn Marche, Mo Fi R Money & Finance Res Grp, CeMaFiR Ctr Macroecon & Finance Res, Ancona, Italy; [Zazzaro, Alberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Mo Fi R Money & Finance Res Grp, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Marche Polytechnic University,"Gambini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Mo Fi R Money & Finance Res Grp, CeMaFiR Ctr Macroecon & Finance Res, Piazzale Martelli 8, Ancona, Italy.",a.gambini@univpm.it; a.zazzaro@univpm.it,,,,,,,112,35,40,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Firms compete in quantities and their location choices result from a trade-off between on the one hand, the informational advantage due to the output flexibility afforded by the location in the country with the weakest employment protection legislation (EPL), and on the other hand, the strategic advantage of the quantity commitment which credibility is ensured by the location in the country with the strictest EPL. Although the analytical framework is very favorable to the flexibility - which is costless -, the country with the strictest EPL may nevertheless attract firms even for relatively high levels of demand uncertainty. Moreover, when a dispersion equilibrium emerges, the level of activity (and hence the level of employment) is higher - on average - in the country with the strictest EPL. Finally, contrary to what might be expected, if firms competed in prices instead of in quantities, they never would agglomerate in the country with the weakest EPL.","[Lecostey, Sophie] Normandie Univ, Caen, France; [Lecostey, Sophie] UNICAEN, CREM CNRS 6211, TEPP, F-14032 Caen, France",Universite de Caen Normandie,"Lecostey, S (通讯作者)，Normandie Univ, Caen, France.",sophie.lecostey@unicaen.fr,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,7,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The likelihood of running a non-farm firm and the returns to running such firms co-vary with agricultural productivity shocks. Diversification into non-farm activities thus provides limited protection against fluctuations in agricultural performance. This may explain why ex-ante risk has no impact on the likelihood of running a non-farm firm. It nonetheless hampers non-farm enterprise development by repressing investment and inducing sorting into less capital-intensive activities. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, what are children's reported valence (unpleasantness-pleasantness) and activation (deactivation-activation) while travelling to different destinations and does this experience have spill-over effects on how they perceive activities at the destination. 206 Children (101 girls) recorded their travels in a diary throughout a school week along with reports of travel mode, experience of every-day travel, activities on arrival, and the experiences of activities. Results showed that average valence and activation was significantly lower while travelling to school than travelling to other destinations. Degree of activation during a school day was significantly lower for those who had travelled by car than for those who had cycled to school. Girls experienced less activation than boys on their way to school and during a school day when they had travelled by car. It is concluded that children's affective experiences differ depending on how they travel and where they go. Moreover, there is a difference between boys' and girls' experiences.

This often requires an understanding of the way in which people interact with their surroundings. Theorists have paid special attention to the interactions of people and place, specifically the endowment of meaning to places (termed sense of place). This work has a host of applications to explain different facets of behavior. Among these, travel behavior is a prime area for sense of place application due to the constant interaction of land use with transportation. In this paper, we explore relationships and examine sense of place using structural equations and derive six distinct factors representing unique dimensions of sense of place. The data used are from a 719-person survey of two shopping centers in Santa Barbara, California, specifically designed to measure sense of place. The factors extracted represent aspects of attachment - the bond between person and place, dependence - the strength of association between person and place, identity - the individual's identity with respect to place, satisfaction - which corresponds to many of the services offered at each place, atmosphere - such as aesthetics and surrounding ambiance, and community - which highlights the views of the place as being family and kid friendly, or a place with kind or friendly people around. These factors are pilot tested as determinants in behavioral models of mode selection, sequencing of activities, and companionship during activities exhibiting substantial potential of explanatory power. This finding motivates a few additional research directions we outline in this paper.

We reevaluate a Bayesian estimated two-country real business cycle model with non-sequentially traded intermediates and a New Keynesian model that incorporates simple vertical specialization using trade-weighted observable series of nine East and Southeast Asian economies. Unsurprisingly, counterfactual co-movements are generated. The failure of these models, we argue, stems from the inappropriate formalization of vertical linkage in production and trade. By extending a two-country New Keynesian model with three processing stages to authentically embrace vertical specialization in the form of vertical and processing trade, we show that the Bayesian estimated model is capable of replicating satisfactorily the business cycle co-movements over a large set of macroeconomic variables. And the quantitative ability survives a battery of sensitivity analysis. We thus infer that formalizing vertical and sequential linkage in production through the lens of three processing stages is a fruitful exercise for an international business cycle model to solve trade-comovement puzzle.

Correlations and volatilities depend on a common market factor, which is the key to stressing them in a consistent and intuitive way. Our approach is based on a new asset price model where correlations and volatilities depend on the current state of the market, which captures market-wide movements in equity-prices. For sample portfolios we compare correlations and volatilities in a normal market and under stress and explore consequences for value-at-risk. We compare our modeling approach with multivariate GARCH models. For all data analyzed our model performs well in capturing the dynamics of volatilities and correlations under stress.

In this paper, we revisit this price disparity puzzle using the channel of parameter uncertainty. In the presence of information asymmetry and market segmentation, investors have different views on a firm's asset volatility, and hence different valuations of the same reference firm. We estimate a structural model for equity pricing using a Bayesian approach, in which the uncertainty of investor model parameters is represented by the posterior standard deviation of the firm's asset volatility. Our regression analysis shows that in addition to other market-based and macro factors, parameter uncertainty explains variations in price disparity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

There are no findings, however, on how public investment affects private investment on a disaggregated basis, such as sectoral private investment. More specifically, previous research has neglected the distinctions of sectoral investment behavior in response to public investment and the possibility of crowd-in effects in some industries, such as industries blessed with public demand. Meanwhile, public investment decreases sectoral private investment not only by keeping rental cost high, but also by differences in the resource misallocation effect of public investment itself; one sector receives a positive wealth effect while another suffers the opposite. In this paper we use a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR), a model capable of analyzing large-scale VAR models, to investigate the extent to which public investment is crowded out or crowded in in different categories of industrial investment. Our results demonstrate that public investment confers different effects, both quantitative and qualitative, in individual sectors. This implies that public investment reaps different benefits in different sectors and that it can bring the worse effect of resource misallocation on some sectors. J. Japanese Int.

We employ personal political contributions' data to measure political ideology distance among groups of inside, outside directors and the CEO. Our empirical evidence strongly supports the notion that outside directors' monitoring effectiveness is more likely to be enhanced when their viewpoints are distinct from those of management. We find that ideologically diverse boards are associated with better firm performance, lower agency costs and less insiders' discretionary power over the firm's Political Action Committee (PAC) spending.

With the help of panel data obtained from rural Kenya, we observed that the proportion of children attending private primary schools increased from 4.6% in 2004 to 11.5% in 2007. The estimation results suggest that parents react to the quality of public education, as measured by the pupil teacher ratios of public schools, by attending private schools and transferring to different schools. Their reaction also depends on the wealth of households and gender. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

But do men and women benefit from the same credit conditions? We investigate this issue by presenting an original model and testing its predictions on an exceptional database comprising 34,000 loan applications from a Brazilian microfinance institution. The model determines the optimal loan size fixed by a gender-biased lender, depending on the borrower's creditworthiness and the intensity of the lender's bias. The empirical analysis detects no gender bias in loan denial, but uncovers disparate treatment with regard to credit conditions. In particular, we find a glass ceiling effect. The gender gap in loan size increases disproportionately with respect to the scale of the borrower's project. The results are insensitive to the loan officer's gender. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We model two primitive assets: value assets and growth assets that are options on assets in place. The cost of option exercise, which is endogenously determined in equilibrium, is highly procyclical and acts as a hedge against risks in assets in place. Consequently, growth options are less risky than value assets, and the model features a value premium. Our model incorporates long-run risks in aggregate consumption and replicates the empirical failure of the conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM) prediction. The model also quantitatively accounts for the pattern in mean returns on book-to-market sorted portfolios, the magnitude of the CAPM-alphas, and other stylized features of the cross-sectional data.

For each market and at a given horizon, we show that the risk premium is well determined by the conditional expected variance of the change in the real exchange rate, agents' real NMP in assets and a constant composite risk aversion coefficient, as suggested by a two-country portfolio asset pricing model. The expected variance depends on the past values of the observed variance and the unobservable real NMP is estimated as a state variable using the Kalman filter methodology. We found that the trends of our estimated horizon-specific NMPs are consistent with the ones of the observed short term aggregate NMPs calculated using the U.S. Treasury International Capital System dataset. Moreover, we show that the ex-post premia tend to adjust toward the ex-ante values, suggesting that experts' beliefs provide a relevant information to the market. These results bring new responses to the difficulties reported by the widespread expost risk premium literature and enhances the usefulness of survey data in modeling the risk premium.

Now, many questions appeared related to the effectiveness of nutrition information in guiding the consumer purchasing behaviour, by encouraging the healthy foods choice. It becomes increasingly clear that many consumers have difficulties in understanding the nutritional information, preferring a simpler way in providing this information, helping them in the rapid evaluation of the nutritional characteristics of a foodstuff. In response to the obvious need to develop a more effective presentation of nutritional information, which convey this information in a simplified and systematic manner, manufacturers and retailers from different countries have created some systems for signalling the nutritional profile. For the nutritional information of greatest interest to be easily perceived by consumers, they have used various forms of graphical representation, that were marked on the front of individual packages (generically called front of package - FOP). Although created in order to facilitate healthy food choices, the effect of these FOP systems on consumers is now controversial. Following a literature review, the paper highlights the main benefits and limitations of the widely used FOP systems in the European Union (Traffic Light and Guideline Daily Amounts). The paper presents also some suggestions for developing an optimal FOP system, standardized and adapted to consumers' needs.","[Tarabella, Angela] Univ Pisa, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Voinea, Lelia] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",University of Pisa; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Voinea, L (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",lelia.voinea@gmail.com,"Voinea, Lelia/AAD-5088-2019","Voinea, Lelia/0000-0002-6164-426X",,,,,27,4,4,2,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2013,15.0,33,,,,,198,209,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,087FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314746900015,0

One adolescent per house/building was purposively interviewed within randomly chosen streets in the locations of study. The study locations consist of densely populated urban areas in Lagos metropolis, Nigeria. The locations were chosen due to high proportion of adolescents in the areas according to the country's census results. Data were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Common social media identified among the respondents includes Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Instagram and LinkedIn. The result also revealed that users of social media in age group 10-14 years are 4.614 times more likely to be exposed to sexual activity at P-value = 0.000. Adolescent users of social media with primary education are 26.953 times more likely to be involved in sexual activity (P-value = 0.000). Those who use social media like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram are 6.932, 4.630, 3.566 and 2.682 times (respectively) more likely to be exposed to sexual activity compared to their counterparts that use other forms of media.

Triggered by the waves of decentralization occurred in many developing countries over the past few decades, following the demise of a development paradigm in which centralized states played a leading role, have led into the important research question, i.e. the effects of decentralization on the equality growth. The recent studies have questioned the existence of a negative relationship between inequality and growth, which becomes the major dilemma of governance institutions in a developing country. Those studies revealed that inequality would be associated with growth more strongly in democracies, which decentralization and autonomy are the proxies. Inequality is bad for growth because it leads to high levels of redistribution, which lead to lower growth. Those empirical findings also revealed that inequality leads to less redistribution, and inequality can be harmful to growth either because redistribution is actually growth enhancing, or because it has other indirect effects on growth. This study aims at re-examining the effect of Indonesian autonomy policy on the equality growth. By using 35 autonomous districts and urban municipals in Central Java Province (Indonesia) for eight years (2001-2008), the study employed a quantified BCG Matrix analysis to test two hypotheses. The results showed that decentralization (the regional autonomy program) has caused inequality of growth, either in the contribution value or in the growth rate of GDP. The results imply that the implementation of decentralization policy and development strategy should be based on the individual characteristics of each regency, or endogenous development. This study contributes to the governance practices, i.e. giving an insightful panorama how to create a better coordination between central government and local management, especially in implementing the stabilized macro economy policy.","[Badrudin, Rudy] STIE YKPN Sch Business Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",,,rudy.badrudin@stieykpn.ac.id; ari.warokka@gmail.com,"Warokka, Ari/M-1314-2019; Warokka, Ari Ari/P-5066-2016","Warokka, Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780; Warokka, Ari Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780",,,,,31,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1255,1267,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100133,0

To tackle these problems this research proposes an intentional model that adopts Map formalism to support personalized learning guidance by an adaptive learning system. The model couples the learner's intention with the learning strategies, and provides a multitude of paths between learner intentions. In fact, based on the corresponding learning mode, the individual learning style and the current electronic media, the learning system can adaptively support the learner to achieve his/her intention through the selected strategy. Preliminary evaluation results shows that the proposed model can successfully guide the adaptive and dynamic learning process construction according to the learning situation and the learners' preferences.","[Bayounes, Walid; Saadi, Ines Bayoudh; Ben Ghezala, Henda] ENSI Manouba Univ, RIADI Res Lab, Manouba, Tunisia; [Kinshuk] Athabasca Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Athabasca, AB, Canada",Universite de la Manouba; Athabasca University,"Bayounes, W (通讯作者)，ENSI Manouba Univ, RIADI Res Lab, Manouba, Tunisia.",walid.bayounes@gmail.com; Ines.bayoudh@ensi.rnu.tn; Kinshuk@ieee.org; henda.benghezala@riadi.rnu.tn,"Ben Ghezala, Henda Hajjami/AAK-7052-2021; Bayoudh Saadi, Ines/M-2391-2015","Ben Ghezala, Henda Hajjami/0000-0002-6874-1388; Bayoudh Saadi, Ines/0000-0001-7419-3800",,,,,13,4,4,2,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1476,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500144,0

The paper is devoted to the sensitivity of the HHI values, which allows simulations of changes in concentration of the relevant market in case of new entry into the market. Let assume model situation in which a new entity has entered the industry with a relevant market share while keeping the total production of the industry unchanged and the production of subjects operating on the market is proportionately reduced. Based on this assumption, it is possible to derive relations that allow to set the boundaries in which the characteristic of the sector remains the same (levels unconcentrated, moderately concentrated, concentrated on the base of methodology of European Commission). Derived relations of the HHI sensitivity can be successfully used as a tool in assessing the entry of a new subject in any industry. It may be difficult to use analysis based on the methodology of the European Commission in case of smaller economies with a smaller number of subjects. Therefore we proposed our approach of setting of the border ranges to characterize the concentration of the industry.

It is only possible to talk on the knowledge-based economy if knowledge, abilities and experiences become the main factor of production. The knowledge management consists of gaining, keeping and utilization of knowledge in the way that allows to perform work better and it is headed towards the status where every process in the organization creates an added value The process-managed organization applies and uses employees' knowledge and abilities, thus, in addition to the organization performance increase, it also increases the performance of individuals through its operation. This is the way of creation of preconditions for the knowledge-based economy formation. The paper submitted focuses on the problems of transformation of organizations that apply the functional management using the principles and elements of the knowledge management in their business.

The main objective is to raise the level of regional convergence in order to offer a better life for the inhabitants of Europe. The European Union spends about 40% of its budget to help poorer regions catch up with the wealthier ones. Whether this hypothesis is valid or not is our main research topic. We tried to identify whether poorer regions register convergence and manage to reduce the gap in terms of GDP/capita between them and if there is any link between the level of structural funds absorption and regional convergence. The paper focuses on the Eastern European countries that joined the European Union in the last accession wave that took place in 2004 and 2007. We used a parametric linear model in order to be able to observe the evolution of the regional convergence in the East European regions of NUTS II level, and compare it to the structural funds absorption rate. Our study focuses on Romania, a new Member State of the European Union that is struggling at present to enforce the structural funds absorption. Through the present study we try to identify whether there is a connection between regional convergence and the structural funds absorption rate.

Recently, many multinational firms have recognised the concept of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and started to accept the necessity of environmental management and launched a number of proactive sustainable practices across their supply chains in order to compete in the global market. Nevertheless, the current knowledge about the impact of SSCM adoption on firms' performance is limited. Previous studies have revealed that organisations seldom gain the potential competitive advantage offered by environmental management programmes. In addition, a number of researchers raised the question of whether or not embracing sustainable practices within the supply chain really pays off, as they did not find a significant direct link between SSCM practices and firms' economic performance and consequently this issue remained inconclusive. Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the relationships between the successful adoption of SSCM practices and organisational performance to understand whether the effective implementation of SSCM practice leads to improved environmental performance and enhance overall financial performance of firms. More specifically, this study explores the linkage between greening the supply chain and environmental and economic performance of manufacturing firms. To support this development, an integrated framework of sustainable supply chain management performance has been conceptualised based on the institutional and resource based view theory. This research provides practitioners with a framework to assess the impact of SSCM practices on firms' environmental and economic performance. Moreover, this work enables manufacturing firms with validated measurement scales to identify particular areas of SSCM where acceptance and improvements are required, facilitating the prioritisation of their green efforts.","[Esfahbodi, Ali; Zhang, Yufeng; Watson, Glyn] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Management, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,,,,"zhang, Yufeng/0000-0003-3531-8193",,,,,38,1,1,0,12,"UNIV CAMBRIDGE, INST MANUFACTURING",CAMBRIDGE,"17 CHARLES BABBAGE RD, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0FS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-902546-18-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,6,14,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BIB59,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000327279000002,0

To attain this objective, sound economy, good governance and sustainable development have been identified as essential vehicles for transforming the economy and the lives of Nigerians. This desire further necessitates the need for a globally competitive public sector that is largely fraud and corruption free. Fraud is a significant problem to the world economy of today. In Nigeria, the government parastatals are known for the increased and alarming rate of fraud, misappropriation and embezzlement of public funds, growing inefficiency and ineffectiveness relative to the private sector, ghost workers, weak institutional structure, poor accountability, excessive centralization of administrative power, and undue rivalry between generalist administrators and professionals.

The research method employs the use of survey research design and engages the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test for analysis. The research finds that fraud and corruption are fundamental problems of the Nigerian public sector and that forensic accountants can assist in ensuring compliance of government units, businesses, and individuals, with regulations at all levels towards the 2020 vision attainment.

At the end of this research, it was clear that the interpretations of this role's span across a project's lifecycle as well as the boundaries to other roles such as the Enterprise Architect's one were not the same.

Anyway, the scope dilemma still persists within a project leading to a role overlap between Enterprise and Solution Architect.","[Faria Magalhaes, Pedro Miguel] Univ Minho, Dept Informat Syst, Guimaraes, Portugal; [Sousa, Rui Dinis] Univ Minho, Dept Informat Syst, Algoritmi R&D Ctr, Guimaraes, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Magalhaes, PMF (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Informat Syst, Guimaraes, Portugal.",pmfmagalhaesa@gmail.com; rds@dsi.uminho.pt,"Sousa, Rui Dinis/M-6477-2013; Magalhães, Pedro Miguel/AAW-6364-2020","Sousa, Rui Dinis/0000-0001-7607-555X;",FEDER through the Competitiveness Factors Operational Programme - COMPETE; FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-022674],FEDER through the Competitiveness Factors Operational Programme - COMPETE; FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work is supported by FEDER funding through the Competitiveness Factors Operational Programme - COMPETE and national funding through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology under the project FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-022674.,,18,0,0,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1681,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500167,0

In the Czech Republic the consequences of the ageing of the population for the pension system are partially eliminated by the constant raising of the retirement age. The article contains the projection of the development of some demo-economic characteristics in the Czech Republic, taking into account the above-mentioned fact with various variants of demographic development. Both values and trends of the development of these characteristics differ relatively strongly from the indicators normally used, which assume a constant upper limit of 65 years for productive age. From the projection it emerges that the constant raising of the retirement age can, in the medium variant of demographic development (assuming the preservation of the size of the population of the Czech Republic at roughly the present level) prevent a decline in labour force in the long term and also contribute to the financial stability of the present pension system. The consequences of the ageing of the population of the Czech Republic would then not look anything like as ominous.","[Fiala, Tomas] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Demog, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,fiala@vse.cz,,,,,,,12,5,5,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,398,407,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100041,0

The model considers bilateral gravity equation as a statistical relationship limited by the multilateral specialization patterns among countries. We test the model on disaggregated bilateral trade data of the European Union (EU) countries. Our results show that trade in final goods between East and West in Europe is driven by multilateral specialization incentives. The identified key drivers are supply side country differences in labour costs with respect to the rest of the world. This finding is compatible with the idea of incomplete specialization.

Second, when used as measures of national performance, the criterion of success should focus on the pace of progress rather than on achieving the targets. Third, we propose an alternative measurement method and find that with this metric, countries of Africa outperform global averages in progress to achieving the MDG targets. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Examples include mobile equipment, such as aircraft, railroad equipment, ships, trucks and trailers, as well as energy generation assets, heavy factory equipment and construction equipment. In the event of obligor default, after a repossession delay and incurring costs of repossession, maintenance, re-marketing and re-deployment, the lender repossesses the asset and sells it on the secondary market and is, thus, subject to the risk of decline in the market value of the asset. The model we develop in this paper treats all forms of asset financing in a unified fashion as contingent claims on the collateral asset and the credit of the borrower. As an application, we estimate the collateral asset model on historical secondary market data for aircraft values and calibrate the financing model to the Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs) issued in 2007 by Continental Airlines and secured by a fleet of new aircraft. We then apply the calibrated model to value private market financing, including bank loans, leases, and credit guarantees, consistently with the capital market financing, and assess the impact of repossession delays on credit spreads. This analysis leads to a policy insight suggesting that bankruptcy laws limiting asset repossession delays lead to lower costs of asset financing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using multiple regression analysis, the results of this questionnaire-based study, show that there is a fairly significant impact of state institutions on the quality of accounting practice in Nigeria. Though joint significance was observed, however, the level of impact differs among the institutions which implies that institutional regulations are not enough to ensure that the quality of accounting practice is high in Nigeria. These findings provide support for the need to streamline, strengthen and harmonize existing regulatory arrangements and codify them as separate law in order to enhance their effectiveness in regulating accounting practice.

We want to show the ways if and how it is possible to get preference for green procurement. There are many ways to do it in practice. Firstly it is necessary to define what the green procurement is and make public choice about supporting it. It is possible to think about three ways to do it: through tender conditions, evaluations (ecological choice of criteria and their weight which should be at 30 % in the framework of the most advantageous offers), and 'green variants.

The raising of retirement age may indeed lead to the preservation of the proportion of persons of productive age in the population, but their age structure will change. The number of new school-leavers entering the labour market will drop and the extension of working activity to an increasingly higher age can be expected both in the case of males and especially in the case of females. The article includes a projection of the development of the age structure of persons of productive age with different variants based on the latest available data.

Whether they place more emphasis on value investment and concerning about long-term development of their enterprises or utilize their advantage of controlling large scale of capital, continue to use dominate and speculation methods to seek short-term interests? hi this paper, we focus on institutional investor's preference for stocks, trying to find certain evidence from their stock preference to judge whether the institutional investors were intended to make long-term investment or short-term speculation when they invested in stocks. Here we use the stocks holding by institutional investors at the end of the fourth quarter from 2003 to 2007 to perform empirical analysis. The regression results of non-equilibrium panel data model indicate that institutional investors preferred companies with higher financial achievement. That indicates institutional investors pay much attention to the basic factors of the companies which they choose and they are prepared to carry out long-term investment. As for our study on corporate governance variables, 2 of the 4 selected variables reveals that institutional investors prefer the companies with a reasonable structure of corporate governance. It shows the corporate governance level is taken into consideration by institutional investors when selecting stocks. The ex ante effect reveals that institutional investors didn't intended to perform short-term spinning speculation, but to long-term investment when they were investing listed companies. However, whether institutional investors take an active part in the process of improving the corporate governance level, whether the ex ante effect exists, whether institutional investors implement active monitoring, are left for further research.","[Li Jing] Foshan Univ, Sch Business, Foshan 528000, Peoples R China",Foshan University,,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-063-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,245,251,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGR19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323863400046,0

This paper analyses an individual firm's behaviour regarding new technology adoption in the presence of illegal immigrants. We assume a Ricardian economy and analyse immigration of illegal unskilled workers in a model of Cournot duopoly where firms are producing homogenous and non-traded goods, and hiring illegal immigrants. A two-stage simultaneous move game is set up: in Stage 1, given the opportunity of hiring illegal immigrants, an individual firm decides whether to adopt the new technology or not, where technology adoption is costly. In Stage 2, each firm will choose the Cournot output level. Solving this two-stage game, we conclude that (i) given the opportunity of hiring illegal immigrants, an individual firm may adopt the new technology and (ii) in the case of zero tolerance of illegal immigration, technology adoption may increase but such technology adoption is immiserizing as it reduces the total surplus.","[Nabin, Munirul H.; Sgro, Pasquale M.] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Burwood, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Sgro, PM (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Burwood, Vic, Australia.",sgro@deakin.edu.au,"Sgro, Pasquale M/C-7629-2013","Sgro, Pasquale/0000-0002-1450-730X",,,,,20,1,1,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The question is whether companies do distinguish between different audience profiles across TV channels and take it into account when considering placing a commercial. This paper analyzes the distribution of commercials among Czech TV channels in 2011 to determine if different audience profiles also reflect a different industry structure of aired commercials. Analysis is based on complete TV commercials data from 2011 obtained from a research agency which provides a comprehensive media monitoring for the whole advertising market in the Czech Republic. To quantify the similarity (or dissimilarity) among TV channels, the cosine similarity measurement was performed. The results indicate there are only small differences in a TV commercial industry structure between TV channels and audience targeting is implemented only by a very few thematic channels.","[Novak, Michal; Kincl, Tomas] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,novak@michalnovak.eu; kincl@fm.vse.cz,"Kincl, Tomas/P-5475-2015; Novák, Michal/C-9906-2011; Kincl, Tomáš/C-2157-2019","Novák, Michal/0000-0001-7893-7774;",,,,,24,8,8,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1,9,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100001,0

Three issues are addressed: (1) what is multi-stakeholder engagement (MSE); (2) why is MSE particularly useful in the context of wicked problems; and, (3) what are some fundamental principles for managing MSE? The first two issues have been addressed by other authors and are covered quickly by laying a sparse logic for their importance and interdependence. The third issue has not been as widely dealt with, yet needs to be more completely fleshed out if MSE is to be a fully intentional vertical coordination strategy in supply chain management. Case-based research into the 30 practical projects in sustainable development carried out by TransForum will provide the motivation for a list of five fundamental principles for managing MSE: (1) focus on system and process performance, (2) manage initiating conditions, (3) engage the multiple stakeholders throughout the process, (4) practice innovation management, and (5) practice monitoring and reflection.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Nowlin Chair Consumer Respons Agr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Peterson, HC (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Nowlin Chair Consumer Respons Agr, 83 Agr Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",peters17@msu.edu,,,,,,,10,13,15,1,20,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Using data from three major surveys conducted between 1957 and 2008, an Eastern Cape district was used as a case study to assess farmers' perceptions of the changes that had occurred, particularly as a result of legislation. Considering the changes, the impacts on the farm labour market and wage and non-wage working conditions are analysed. The legislation focused on includes the Extension of Security of Tenure Act 62 (ESTA) of 1997, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 (BCEA) of 1997 and minimum wage legislation. Farmers believed legislation had both positive and negative effects, which were compounded by changes in the political and economic contexts. The case study reveals that government has a role in improving the status of farm labourers, with education and healthcare services requiring special attention. However, caution is needed to ensure that further reductions in farm employment are restricted.","[Roberts, T.; Antrobus, G.

This is the case of trade declared by non-resident units, which is more and more common within the European Union. This phenomenon is even enhanced by the strategic geographical location of the Czech Republic, which is important factor why a lot of this quasi-transit trade is being operated. The overvaluation of the trade balance is divided into exports (which are over-valuated) and imports (which are under-valuated).

The increasing demand for high-quality and sustainable coffees is driving land-use decisions among Colombian farmers. A value chain analysis shows that farmers who sell to differentiated markets significantly captured a larger portion of the value added and faced lower volatility than mainstream producers. Consequently, regions apt for producing differentiated coffees experienced the greatest increase in area planted. Tracing the value chain reveals how land use decisions increasingly depend on the pressures and opportunities created by global markets, with detectable impacts on livelihoods and landscapes.

The project team consisted of various different actors with different interests with one actor eventually revolting against the project.

Methodological approaches of economic, social, cultural and political history, economics and statistics were pursued and required in this study. An interdisciplinary approach that enabled further determination of factors will serve as the approach for all subsequent research of the UEP position in science in the fifties of the 20th century. Yet untapped primary sources from UEP Scientific Council Meetings were used, also published sources, newspapers, etc. We came to the conclusion that UEP failed to significantly increase the number of professors and associate professors in the first seven years of its existence. The reasons behind were: 1) Policy of the Communist leadership that followed cadre policies which frustrated many personalities and prevented them a chance to work for universities. 2) Only highly politically reliable teachers were awarded. 3) Bureaucratic apparatus rigidity and poor flexibility of the Ministry of Education and the State Committee for Scientific Degrees. 4) Ongoing continual changes in laws and regulations. 5) Lack of experienced teachers who had also been overwhelmed with paperwork and various out of university activities so they had little time to immerse in intense research activity. Analysis showed that some of the preferred fields after 1948 such as political economy were not preferred at the expense of others.","[Stellner, Frantisek] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, CZ-40096 Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Vokoun, Marek] Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Stellner, F (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Pasteurova 1, CZ-40096 Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",fstellner@gmail.com; marek.vokoun@vse.cz,"Vokoun, Marek/AAI-3302-2020","Vokoun, Marek/0000-0001-5659-3085",,,,,37,2,2,0,6,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The paper provides direct empirical evidence on cyclicality and the long-term and short-term relationship between government expenditure in compliance with the COFOG international standard and output. The Johansen cointegration test and the error correction model are used for analysis. The results state significant differences in size and importance of public sector in the selected countries.

Yet, these theories may not be adequate to explain today's human collective behaviors in the Digital Age. Societies worldwide are witnessing more and more unexpected collective behaviors such as flash mobs than a decade ago. Therefore, understanding what is shaping human collective behaviors in the 21st century would give insight into a variety of current, important societal phenomena and issues in the Digital Age. The researchers conducted a pilot study on flash mobs as a means to investigate the collective behaviors inspired by modern social media and its potential impact on business practices in the Digital Age. Researchers observed that flash mobs serve a wide range of purposes ranging from business marketing to personal artistic expression. Some are constructive to our society and others are not. What factors trigger flash mobs? Can flash mobs be an effective tool used in business practices? In this research, we develop a framework with social, economic, demographic, and technological dimensions based on Melucci's (1989) new social movement theory and five hypotheses. Data was collected, filtered, and analyzed based on flash mob activities in the United States occurred during 2003-2013 that was posted on YouTube. The results of this study revealed that: 1.The frequency of flash mobs activities and the number of mobbers (participants of flash mobs) are highly correlated to the city's population. 2. The more people with higher post-secondary education, the more frequency of flash mobs activities. 3. No correlation exists between the income level and the frequency of flash mobs. 4. More business- type flash mobs happened in the Northern states than elsewhere in the United States. At this stage, there is no sufficient data to support the possession of mobile cellular phones as a contributing factor to the frequency of flash mob occurrence.","[Wang, C.

THRIVE Farmers International is a socially-oriented start-up with a new model for the coffee supply chain. The traditional supply chain for coffee is often criticized as being exploitative of farmers and the environment. The THRIVE system allows farmers to own their product further along the supply chain. Thus, the farmers function like a vertically integrated operation, selling a high-value product and retain the corresponding profit margins-5 to 10 times what they would get in traditional markets. As a result, the THRIVE model connects farmers and consumers directly. THRIVE offers customers the value of knowing who grows their high quality coffee.

We analyze the determinants of trying local wine and visiting local wineries. Finally, we examine differences in post-winery visit behavior. Our results suggest that the frequency of wine consumption and increase in wine knowledge positively influence the decision to try a local wine and visit a local winery.","[Woods, Timothy A.; Nogueira, Lia] Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Yang, Shang-Ho] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 402, Taiwan",University of Kentucky; National Chung Hsing University,"Nogueira, L (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, 317 Charles E Barnhart Bldg, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",tim.woods@uky.edu; lia.nogueira@uky.edu; e8310040@msn.com,,,Kentucky Horticulture Council; Kentucky Ag Development Fund; USDA Southern Risk Management Education Center,Kentucky Horticulture Council; Kentucky Ag Development Fund; USDA Southern Risk Management Education Center,"We would like to thank the Kentucky Horticulture Council, the Kentucky Ag Development Fund and the USDA Southern Risk Management Education Center for supporting this project.",,34,10,12,0,9,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

In this direction, the introduction of the seismological education in schools was welcomed with great interest. The Romanian Educational Seismic Network is a national project with many educational, scientific and social goals and represents an innovative program in Romania. The main educational objectives are referring to: training students and teachers in the analysis and interpretation of seismological data, preparing educational materials, designing and testing didactic activities. The scientific objective is to introduce in schools the use of scientific instruments like seismographs (SEP Seismometer) and experimental methods (seismic data analysis) that are usually restricted to research laboratories. The main product is to create an earthquake database which will be used by students and teachers for educational purposes. Regarding the social objectives, the project represents an effective instrument for informing and raising seismic risk awareness. The network consist of nine seismic stations with SEP seismometers installed in high-schools from the most important seismic areas (Vrancea, Banat, Fagaras, Dobrogea), vulnerable cities (Bucharest, Iasi) or high populated places (Cluj, Sibiu, Timisoara, Zalau). The educational materials consist of a collection entitled Earthquakes and their effects, which includes educational materials for all pre-university education classes taking the form of two books (except preschool level), one for teachers and one for students. They are governed by the concept learning by doing. Applying this concept the students will develop scientific aptitudes (measurements, direct observations, theory formulation and verification, database study) and they will be attracted to domain as Geology, Geography, Physics, Mathematics, Informatics, etc. Teaching modules includes laboratory exercises like earthquake location and magnitude estimation using waveforms recorded by their school seismometers, valuables information on how the earthquake affects the surrounding environment and buildings.","[Zaharia, Bogdan; Tataru, Dragos; Grecu, Bogdan; Constantin, Ionescu; Tibu, Speranta] Natl Inst Earth Phys, Magurele, Romania; [Tibu, Speranta] Inst Sci Educ, Bucharest, Romania; [Bican-Brisan, Nicoleta] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",National Institute for Earth Physics (NIEP); Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,,,"Zaharia, Bogdan/G-1943-2010; Brisan, Nicoleta-Sanda B/L-6743-2013","Brisan, Nicoleta-Sanda B/0000-0003-1264-712X",,,,,5,0,0,0,8,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,513,520,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400068,0

The widespread decline in CME services suggests that it is important to understand what is at stake in terms of the critical benefits and values of these services. This article examines how environmental and resource economics has contributed to our knowledge of CME services and discusses progress as well as challenges in valuing these services. The article highlights case studies in which the economic valuation of key CME services has influenced policy decisions concerning the management of CMEs. Two key features of CME benefits are also examined. First, the natural spatial variability in these systems can influence the economic value of CME services. Second, because they occur at the interface between watersheds, the coast, and open water, CMEs can produce cumulative and synergistic benefits across the entire seascape that are much more significant and unique than the services provided by any single ecosystem.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ebarbier@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,106,150,176,0,228,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

This paper is concerned with empirically assessing the effects of risk aversion and rainfall variability on farm level diversity. Unique panel data from Ethiopia consisting of experimentally generated risk aversion measures combined with rainfall data are employed in the analysis. The major contribution of this study is its explicit treatment of individual risk preferences in the decision to diversify, simultaneously controlling for environmental risk in the form of rainfall variability. Covariate shocks from rainfall variability are found to positively contribute to an increased level of diversity with individual risk aversion having a positive but less significant role. We find that rainfall variability in spring has a greater effect than rainfall variability summer-the major rainy season. This finding is in line with similar agronomic-meteorological studies. These results imply that in situ biodiversity conservation could be effective in areas with high rainfall variability. However, reduction in risk aversion, which is associated with poverty reduction, is likely to reduce in situ conservation.","[Bezabih, Mintewab] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England; [Sarr, Mare] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Sussex; University of Cape Town,"Bezabih, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Mantel Bldg, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England.",M.Bezabih@sussex.ac.uk; mare.sarr@uct.ac.za,,"Sarr, Mare/0000-0002-5903-7102",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,42,53,61,5,71,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

For firms listing before Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), we find that governance has no significant effect on delisting but after SOX, it becomes one of the main forces driving delisting. For firms whose delisting decision is most likely attributable to SOX, we find they realize low benefits from listing - they originate from countries with strong home market governance, and from listing onward realize low trading volume, analyst coverage, and make little use of capital raising. Our results suggest that SOX has had a large influence on the benefits seek from a U.S. listing, leading firms from well governed countries and low capital raising needs to delist.

Thus, in the presence of an ACM, bailout expectations of a regional government do not lead to excessive borrowing.

Simulation results demonstrate that, in contrast to continental migration, increased intercontinental migration has strong positive household welfare effects. Similarly, an increase in the stay abroad of intercontinental migrants impacts positively on welfare of the migrant-sending household. Results of these simulations lend support to the introduction of a TMP, which would, in addition to facilitating migration control in host economies, improve the welfare of sending households by allowing for increased engagement in intercontinental migration. The temporary nature of such a program would ensure that Dutch disease effects would be mitigated through eventual migrant return. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First it explains the reasons why services exports are presumably connected with manufacturing exports and altogether to goods exports. The paper scrutinises the various headings of the services account of the BOP. It points out that firms, whether manufacturing or services-producing tend to exports both goods and services. It then turns to the international division of labour and fragmentation process. Second, the paper proposes statistical analyses based on time series of goods and services exports. The first one concerns annual one-digit headings for 13 developed countries. The last one pertains to quarterly data from 1994 to 2011 for 24 developed countries. Not surprisingly, the results tend to ascertain the complementarities of the two types of exports, with a correlation of around 60 %. This exploratory study however calls for future improvements and reconsiderations that could go beyond basic time series analysis.","Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, LAb Rech Gest & Econ LARGE, F-67082 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Damien, B (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, LAb Rech Gest & Econ LARGE, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",damien.broussolle@unistra.fr,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2012,14.0,,,,6,,600,620,,,,,,21,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,038UI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311199200003,0

These effects are investigated separately for three dimensions of dynamic capabilities (sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring) and for different business strategies (prospector, analyzer and defender). Empirical evidence was obtained from 203 companies operating in different sectors in nine countries. The distribution of companies with respect to countries is as follows: Turkey (49), Denmark (26), the Netherlands (46), Finland (13), Australia (19), Norway (8), Spain (18), Portugal (11) and Slovakia (13). The findings revealed that sensing capabilities not only had significant effects on new product development performance for prospectors but unexpectedly for analyzers and defenders as well. Furthermore, seizing capabilities was a significant driver of performance for both prospectors and analyzers. Reconfiguring capabilities was identified as a significant driver of performance only for analyzers. The findings are discussed along with theoretical and managerial implications.","Bilkent Univ, Isletme Fak, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Gumusluoglu, L (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Isletme Fak, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",tomruk@bilkent.edu.tr,"Gumusluoglu, Lale/AGO-1336-2022",,,,,,73,1,1,1,45,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

A proposal for such a line put forward by Network Rail in 2009 is used as the basis for the analysis. Using travel time to London as the main benchmark to measure accessibility of a station on the current (conventional) and future (high-speed) rail networks the paper examines the likely winners and losers from the construction of the new line. The results show that the accessibility benefits from the proposed line are relatively limited in terms of geographic spread and that many cities close to it would not see any travel time reductions on journeys to London, thus will not see any accessibility benefits in this respect. For such places, this will translate to a relative reduction in the accessibility to London, when compared to other locations, and thus to potentially adverse socioeconomic implications. The paper concludes by arguing that any examination of a HSR line must consider a wider geographic area than just the cities, and especially the stations, on the line and it therefore must give due consideration to integration between transport networks, and especially between the high-speed and conventional rail networks. Based on the current analysis, the paper concludes that the case for a HSR line in the UK from a regional accessibility perspective is questionable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Since shareholders ultimately decide when to announce bankruptcy, such tax subsidies can incentivize them to strategically postpone default. Therefore, corporate taxation can influence corporate cost of debt. Using a large panel of corporate bonds, we find supporting evidence: credit spreads become smaller as tax loss carries grow larger. In contrast, tax shields such as depreciation, which limit loss carry gains, lead to wider spreads. Interestingly, when stockholders hold greater bargaining power - due to large managerial ownership - larger corporate tax shields lead to even narrower credit spreads. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing research is specialized in analyzing the determinants of fund flows, but few studies have been able to investigate buying and selling behavior separately. Unique data from Spain allow us to tackle this issue by using exact information of purchases and redemptions. We find that investment flows are sensitive to past performance, though this sensitivity is more noticeable when using inflows and outflows in contrast to implied flows. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest asymmetric behavior of investors given that purchases are better explained by fund return than redemptions.

This paper attempts to test Friedman velocity hypothesis by examining the relationship between income velocity and monetary growth variability for Turkey during the period 1987Q1-2010Q3, using linear and nonlinear time series methods. To this end, both unit root and cointegration tests with structural break as well as asymmetric cointegration and error correction models proposed by Enders and Granger (1998), Enders and Siklos (2001) are employed. The empirical results indicate that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between income velocity and monetary growth variability derived from EGARCH model.

The article uses a unique database on asset retirements by manufacturing firms in the Netherlands and relates it to a range of economic and innovation variables. We find that innovation plays a significant role in determining the discard of capital assets. Process innovation by a firm is important in the case of machinery scrapping, while the introduction of a new product in a firm increases discards of computers. We also find evidence for an obsolescence effect: the average age has a significant role in discarding, in particular, computers.

One of our major findings is that the magnitude of the indirect effect exceeded that of the direct effect over almost the entire period. This implies that more than half of the effects of exports appeared through intraindustry linkages. We also found the indirect effect of goods exports is not limited to goods industries. As a result, the increases in the export dependence of employment are not limited to major Japanese export-oriented industries such as electrical machinery, motor vehicles, and general machinery. In identifying the potential risks of negative external shocks, it is important for policy makers to estimate how much employment is indirectly as well as directly dependent on exports.

We use data collected from households, vendors and seed samples to test the way market purchases of grain and seed affect household food consumption and millet genetic diversity. Purchase of millet grain in markets contributes to food security, but reduces dietary diversity - suggesting that scarce cash was directed toward meeting staple food needs first. Farmers purchased millet grain for seed only in the site with riskier rainfall and smaller market fairs. Although they were more likely to purchase in markets where the genetic dissimilarity of seed was higher, purchasing seed in markets was negatively associated with on-farm diversity. Seed shortage rather than variety experimentation appears to be the motivation for seed purchase. Introducing certified seed in rural markets through small-scale traders will require the provision of market services and promotional efforts.","[Smale, Melinda] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Smale, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",msmale@msu.edu; lamissa.diakite@ier.ml; naman.keita@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,20,12,13,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We use firm-level evidence to empirically examine the effect of US corporate governance on Japanese M&A and non-M&A FDI.

The recent turn in China's agrarian transition towards vertical integration of agriculture with industries is, however, undermining these conditions and may move China towards more convergence with other countries.

We consider policy choice in a representative democracy when voters do not fully anticipate a politician's strategic behavior to manipulate his reelection chances. We find that this limited strategic sophistication affects policy choice in a fundamental way. Under perfect sophistication, a politician does not make any use of his private information but completely panders to voters' opinions. In contrast, under limited sophistication, a politician makes some use of private information and panders only partially. Limited sophistication crucially determines how welfare under representative democracy compares to welfare under alternative political institutions such as direct democracy or governance by experts. We find that, under limited strategic sophistication, representative democracy is preferable to the other institutions from an ex ante perspective. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It uses data from a large survey of commuter rail passengers, a detailed parking inventory of station parking lots, and data from the American Community Survey. It compares the catchment areas of stations and the likelihood of individuals boarding at stations with and without parking restrictions by using ordinary least squares, mixed regression, and logit models. It further examines the rail use propensity of communities when the nearest station prohibits non-resident parking by ordinary least squares and tobit models. The analyses show that, all else being equal, stations with nonresident parking restrictions have smaller catchment areas and passengers are less likely to use these stations compared to stations without restrictions.

It documents two contrasting eras: first a Rules-Based Era from 1985 to 2003 and second an Ad Hoc Era from 2003 to the present. During the Rules-Based Era, monetary policy, in broad terms, followed a predictable systemic approach, and economic performance was generally good. During the Ad Hoc Era, monetary policy is best described as a discretion of authorities approach, and economic performance was decidedly poor. By considering alternative explanations of this policyperformance correlation and examining corroborating evidence, the lecture concludes that rules-based policies have clear advantages over discretion.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Taylor, JB (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",johnbtaylor@stanford.edu,,,,,,,33,70,80,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

On one hand, Chinese policymakers must develop sustainable transportation policies including those of car demand reduction: on the other, they must continue to promote the auto industry in the name of economic growth. Understanding the cultural currents behind car ownership, future car growth, and driver behavior is critical for developing responsive and effective policies. However, little is known regarding the attitudes and socio-cultural context surrounding the explosive growth in car ownership. A survey of Chinese college students - consumers with greater future purchasing power - was conducted to understand student attitudes, social norms, and aspiration for car ownership. A strong desire for car ownership among the participants supports the assertion that rapid car growth is likely to continue, but most likely in smaller cities and rural areas. Moreover, perceived psychosocial values of car ownership such as feelings of freedom and control are more likely to be framed by the students' immediate social environment. The psychosocial valuations dominate the aspiration for car ownership at a level greater than the instrumental valuations of car ownership - for example, speed or convenience of using a private car. Understanding and changing consumers' psychosocial valuation of cars is increasingly critical in curbing future growth in car ownership and use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For decades, the Reuters/Michigan Survey of Consumers and other national surveys have asked about expectations for prices in general, with responses being used by academic economists, policy makers, and central bankers. Although median responses track official inflation estimates, respondents exhibit considerable disagreement, with some reporting seemingly large overestimations. Here, we demonstrate that changes in the wording of survey questions about inflation expectations affect the central tendency of responses as well as their dispersion. We randomly assigned respondents to questions asking about prices in general, inflation, or prices you pay. Respondents' expectations and perceptions were lower and less dispersed when questions asked about inflation instead of prices in general or prices you pay, with the latter two formulations eliciting similar response patterns. These question-wording effects were mediated by how much respondents thought of (extreme) personal price experiences when receiving questions about prices in general or prices you pay. Compared to questions about inflation, questions about prices in general and prices you pay elicited expectations that were more strongly correlated to expected increases in gas prices, which were relatively large and likely salient at that time.

When managerial compensation comprises both ownership shares and an earnings-based bonus, there are significant differences in the effects of these two types of performance compensation on managers' optimal investment and financing decisions, agency costs, optimal debt ratios and credit spreads, as a result of the specific interactions between the investment and financing decisions.

Accounting for uncertainty, results indicate that, on average, current variability reduces gross domestic product by 4% over a 10-year period and pulls 2% of the population below the poverty line. Socioeconomic impacts are much larger during major drought years, thus underscoring the importance of extreme weather events in determining climate damages. Climate change scenarios draw on projections for 2025. Results indicate that, in the worst case scenario, damages caused by climate change are half the size of those from current variability. The paper concludes that current climate variability, rather than climate change, will remain the more binding constraint on economic development in Zambia, at least over the next few decades.","[Thurlow, James] UNU WIDER, FI-00160 Helsinki, Finland; [Zhu, Tingju; Diao, Xinshen] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Thurlow, J (通讯作者)，UNU WIDER, Katajanokanlaituri 6 B, FI-00160 Helsinki, Finland.",thurlow@wider.unu.org,"Thurlow, James/JQW-4545-2023; Zhu, Tingju/C-8175-2015","Thurlow, James/0000-0003-3414-374X; Zhu, Tingju/0000-0002-6882-3551",,,,,19,42,47,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

He states that it is critical that policymakers, business leaders, investors, and researchers alike understand better why so many unthinkable events have become facts, why the outlook remains unusually uncertain, and what changes are needed to limit the risks of further disruptions and bad surprises down the road.

The implementation of FAS 123R represents an exogenous change in the accounting benefits of stock options that has no effect on the economic costs and benefits of options for providing managerial incentives. Our results do not support the view that the convexity inherent in option-based compensation is used to reduce risk-related agency problems between managers and shareholders. We show that all firms dramatically reduce their usage of stock options (convexity) after the adoption of FAS 123R and that the decline in option use is strongly associated with a proxy for accounting costs. Little evidence exists that the decline in option usage following the accounting change results in less risky investment and financial policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that positive earnings surprises and positive profit announcements produce a larger uncertainty resolution than negative earnings surprises and loss announcements. We demonstrate an inverse relation between the change in implied volatility and earnings news in a three-day window immediately after an earnings announcement. We refer to the magnitude of this relation as the 'options market earnings response coefficient'. This 'options market earnings response coefficient' is stronger for both bad news announcements and positive profit announcements. We do not find any significant relation between changes in implied volatility and earnings news in the pre- or post-announcement periods. We conclude that the options market efficiently absorbs earnings information. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of panel data for European firms that were included in the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index over time, our micro-econometric analysis with fixed and random effects models implies positive impacts on return on assets for continental European countries, but insignificant effects for Anglo-Saxon European countries (i.e., the United Kingdom and Ireland). Furthermore, the impacts on alternative indicators of corporate financial performance such as Tobin's Q are generally insignificant. The weak or neutral effect of inclusion in the DJSI World on corporate financial performance can be explained by several mutually confounding factors. Furthermore, the composition of this sustainability stock index is influenced by factors that need not necessarily be directly connected to corporate environmental or social activities, so that potential positive and negative effects of corporate sustainability performance on financial performance can be weakened. Methodologically, this study again supports the strong relevance of unobserved firm heterogeneity since the application of misspecified pooled regression models leads to obviously biased estimation results.","[Ziegler, Andreas] Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Ziegler, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Ctr Corp Responsibil & Sustainabil, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland",Universitat Kassel; University of Zurich,"Ziegler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",andreas.ziegler@uni-kassel.de,,,,,,,41,23,24,3,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Repo transactions are collateralized, frequently with securitized bonds. We refer to the combination of securitization plus repo finance as securitized banking and argue that these activities were at the nexus of the crisis. We use a novel data set that includes credit spreads for hundreds of securitized bonds to trace the path of the crisis from subprime-housing related assets into markets that had no connection to housing. We find that changes in the LIB-OIS spread, a proxy for counterparty risk, were strongly correlated with changes in credit spreads and repo rates for securitized bonds. These changes implied higher uncertainty about bank solvency and lower values for repo collateral. Concerns about the liquidity of markets for the bonds used as collateral led to increases in repo haircuts, that is the amount of collateral required for any given transaction. With declining asset values and increasing haircuts, the US banking system was effectively insolvent for the first time since the Great Depression. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyses the causal impact of fathers' job loss on their children's educational attainment and later economic outcomes. To do so, we isolate the effect of job loss associated with major industry contractions, mainly in manufacturing, during the recession of the 1980s by mapping industry-level employment change data from 1980 to 1983 into the British Cohort Study (BCS). Children with fathers who were identified as being displaced did significantly worse in terms of their GCSE attainment than those with non-displaced fathers. A child with a displaced father obtained, on average, 18 grade points lower or half a GCSE at grades A*C less than their otherwise-identical counterparts, the equivalent of about 2 per cent lower wages as an adult. There is also a small effect of fathers' displacement on the early labour market attachment of children, but no direct impact on their earnings at age 30/34. This does not mean that the impact of job loss will not affect social mobility. Those with lower income, education and social class were most affected by job losses and there is a direct effect on education and youth unemployment, which we know to be drivers of later earnings. This suggests that the recent recession may have significant long-term consequences for the children of those who have lost their jobs.","[Gregg, Paul] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Macmillan, Lindsey] Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [Nasim, Bilal] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Bath; University of Bristol; Imperial College London,"Gregg, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",p.gregg@bath.ac.uk; lindsey.macmillan@bristol.ac.uk; b.nasim10@imperial.ac.uk,"Macmillan, Lindsey/B-1840-2016","Macmillan, Lindsey/0000-0003-1262-303X","ESRC [ES/E00234X/1, ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E00234X/1, ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,23,26,29,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

The Case of Diesel-Electric Hybrid Technology for Urban Delivery Vehicles,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMICS,"A central question for environmental policy is whether the long-term benefits of energy-saving technologies are sufficient to justify their short-term costs, and if so, whether financial incentives are needed to stimulate adoption. The fiscal effects of incentivizing new technologies, and the revenue effects of using the technology, are also policy relevant, given current fiscal constraints. This study evaluates the economic and fiscal effects of promoting diesel-electric hybrid technology in urban delivery vehicles, an application supported by U.S. policymakers. An economic model is used to simulate the conditional probability density functions of the net present values (NPVs) of diesel electric hybrids annually from 2012 to 2030. The NPV time paths, which reflect fuel price, environmental, and technology trends, show the expected dates that hybrids become economically viable, and allow an evaluation of the net benefits of hybrid technology as an investment over the entire simulation horizon. The NPV distributions are computed for five stakeholder classes, including transportation firms, parties benefiting from reduced externality damages, state and local governments, and the larger society. The analysis shows that hybrid technology investment does not appear to be justified from a societal perspective at a 7 percent discount rate, but the probability for positive net returns increases substantially at a 3 percent rate.

First, although information demand and supply tend to be positively correlated, their dynamic interactions do not allow conclusive inferences about the information discovery process. Second, demand for information at the market level is significantly positively related to historical and implied measures of volatility and to trading volume, even after controlling for market return and information supply. Third, information demand increases significantly during periods of higher returns.

First, we show that recent criticism of such decompositions is misplaced and builds on invalid VAR models and erroneous interpretations. Second, we derive the requirements needed for VAR decompositions to be valid. A crucial - but often neglected - requirement is that the asset price needs to be included as a state variable in the VAR. In equity return decompositions this requirement is equivalent to including the dividend-price ratio in the VAR. Finally, we clarify the intriguing issue of the role of the residual component in return decompositions. In a properly specified first-order VAR, it makes no difference whether cash flow news or discount rate news is backed out residually, and it makes no difference whether both news components are computed directly or one of them is backed out residually.

Motivated by this finding, we establish a set of assumptions needed to construct a beta estimate from option-implied return moments using equity and index options.

In doing so, we highlight historical transformations in fishing operations given the commodification of bluefin tuna and the growth imperative of capitalism. Fieldwork in Sicily and Sardinia, in-depth interviews, and primary and secondary data inform this analysis. Within the global agro-food system, traditional trap fisheries that operated for centuries have diminished. Industrialized fishing and tuna-ranching operations that make use of high-tech, capital-intensive methods have reorganized production, including the labour process, the capture of fish and the lifecycles of bluefin tuna. In an attempt to profit from the exploitation of the most prized fish in the world, capitalist fishing operations are harvesting bluefin tuna at a rate that exceeds the reproductive capabilities of the existing stock, which has had negative consequences for the traditional trap fishery and may lead to the collapse of this fishery. Modern capitalist social relations have destabilized an ecological system that has long been coupled with human systems within a few decades, with extensive socio-ecological consequences.

The results suggest that (1) losses in pension benefits were the greatest if unemployment occurred in the middle of a career (between 31 and 50); (2) social security policies have had a mitigating effect on losses in pension benefits.

We focus on two aspects: wealth and income transfers from borrowing firms to lenders and firm heterogeneity. At the firm level, we find that the currency collapses are preceded and associated with sharply rising financial transfers from firms to lenders. The debt and income structure is central in explaining the asymmetric firm dynamics. Most affected are firms with high levels of unhedged foreign-currency debt. At the country level, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico display three contrasting examples. Argentina has a large currency mismatch, Brazil balances the currency denomination of debt and income (natural hedge), and Mexico occupies an intermediate position. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Federal regulators instituted preemption that limited the scope and reach of state antipredatory lending regulations for certain lenders. Based on the variation in state laws and the variation in the regulatory environment among lenders, this paper identifies the effects of federal preemption of state APLs on the quality of mortgages originated by preempted lenders. The results provide evidence of a relatively higher increase in default risk among loans exempted from strong state antipredatory laws. These results are most robust among refinance mortgages with adjustable interest ratesa large and highly dynamic market in the period of analysis. The findings provide initial evidence that preemption of state mortgage lending regulations may result in an increase in mortgage default risk, thus limiting consumer protection in the residential mortgage market.","[Ding, Lei] Wayne State Univ, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Quercia, Roberto G.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Community Capital, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA; [Reid, Carolina K.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, Res Grp, Community Dev Dept, San Francisco, CA USA; [White, Alan M.] Valparaiso Univ, Sch Law, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA",Wayne State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; Valparaiso University,"Ding, L (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",,,"Reid, Carolina/0000-0002-1315-6413",,,,,31,19,25,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

It draws on analyses of secondary data sources, qualitative interviews and a focus group discussion with employers, trainers and other actors in the labour market, and a survey of young people in their penultimate year of compulsory schooling. Using the concept of the low skills equilibrium', it discusses how a relatively poor transport infrastructure and a dispersed population combine to present challenges for local economic development. It concludes that transport and travel play a crucial 'cause' and 'effect' role in exacerbating poor skills and low productivity, through thwarting attempts to improve access to learning and training that would help the local economy to achieve higher levels of productivity and economic growth.

It does so by considering a case study of Belfast. Although Belfast has a distinctive recent history as the site of political violence and territorial division, it also has a spatial configuration that emerged out of a modernising roads and redevelopment programme in the 1960s and 1970s. However, an understanding of contemporary Belfast, particularly its urban structure and form, requires an analysis of how the social impacts of such ubiquitous regional and urban planning practices were not addressed. The article argues that a culture of 'politically safe' bureaucratic inaction developed during the 'war years' has been sustained in the 'new democracy'. In turn, this has had significant consequences for the functioning of the city. Major areas of derelict land around the city core together with the impediments created by regional road infrastructure have combined to create a doughnut city that, on the one hand, facilitates a commuting middle class, while on the other, discriminates against the poorest inner city communities. The article goes on to examine how an activist urban design group, known as the Forum for Alternative Belfast, has responded to these challenges. It focuses particularly on action-research undertaken during its 2010 Summer School which aimed to address issues of disconnection in inner North Belfast that affect some of the most territorialised and deprived communities in the city.

Several studies have put forward a number of possible costs and benefits for a firm if it interrupts the life of its convertible bonds prior to their contractual maturity. However, in this paper we argue that the managerial decision to call back a convertible bond is mainly driven by a fundamental variable almost neglected up until now: the time value extraction from bondholders' conversion option. Accordingly, we propose a measure for the effective convenience of calling which we define as net time value advantage and we show, using a survival analysis, that it is more effective than previously proposed measures in explaining the firms' observed call policy.

The decline and disappearance are robust to considerations of R&D and cash reserves, and across groups of firms. The information content in cash flow regarding investment opportunities has declined, but measurement error in Tobin's q does not completely explain the patterns in investment-cash flow sensitivity.

This evidence suggests that connected firms' managers list their firms overseas for private (political) benefits.

I show that imperfectly insured household consumption distorts household incentive to supply labor hours through an idiosyncratic income effect, which in turn generates strategic complementarities in price setting and thus amplifies business cycle fluctuations. This mechanism diminishes the role of nominal rigidities and makes sticky-price models more consistent with microeconomic evidence on the frequency of price changes.","Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",jwlee@econ.rutgers.edu,"Lee, Jaewon/IQR-8432-2023",,,,,,43,2,3,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Prior research, however, only focused on whether apologies can reveal positive effects on the reconciliation process but did not focus yet on whether perpetrators are actually willing to apologize. In this paper we investigate perpetrator's willingness to apologize for a trust violation in a bargaining setting. We hypothesized that perpetrators willingness to apologize would be a function of the extent to which the victim of the trust violation is willing to forgive. This effect, however, was expected to emerge only among those perpetrators who are low in dispositional trust. The results from a laboratory study with actual transgressions and actual apologetic behavior supported our predictions and thus emphasize an instrumental view on apologizing in bargaining situations.

A set of three hypotheses has been tested during the research using primary information obtained through a questionnaire-based survey. The information has been processed using SPSS software. The results of our research outline the facts that the population of Bucharest is selective when choosing the information channels, that there is a low correlation between the civic expression and the individual behaviour due to an early development of the non-government organizations, the reduced civic involvement and the adverse accommodation of messages to target groups.

While most studies in the literature focus on point forecasts, we apply semiparametric interval forecasting to a group of exchange rate models. Forecast intervals for 10 OECD exchange rates are generated and the performance of the empirical exchange rate models are compared with the random walk. Our contribution is twofold. First, we find that in general, exchange rate models generate tighter forecast intervals than the random walk, given that their intervals cover out-of-sample exchange rate realizations equally well. Our results suggest a connection between exchange rates and economic fundamentals: economic variables contain information useful in forecasting distributions of exchange rates. We also find that the benchmark Taylor rule model performs better than the monetary, PPP and forward premium models, and its advantages are more pronounced at longer horizons. Second, the bootstrap inference framework proposed in this paper for forecast interval evaluation can be applied in a broader context, such as inflation forecasting.","[Wang, Jian] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX USA; [Wu, Jason J.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX USA.",jian.wang@dal.frb.org; jason.j.wu@frb.gov,,,,,,,62,16,22,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

This paper develops the concept of resource spillover, which captures the various ways in which firms can benefit from collaborations with university scientists. The study categorizes the resources possessed by university scientists into intellectual capital, social capital, and positional capital, and tests the impact of each on the performance of firms.

The learning experiences included realistic trade scenario allowing students to simulate the process and explore possible results of their actions during the game. The conversations used during the game were derived from real business environment helping students to realize how their classroom learning was connected to actual international trade environment during this activity. The purpose of this research was to observe the effects of business simulation game on maritime business students' understanding of international trade process.
