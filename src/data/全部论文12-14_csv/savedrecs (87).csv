The same property is shown not to apply for nonlinear cointegration. The limit properties of the Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator for cointegrating regression under misspecified lag structure are derived, showing the NW estimator to be inconsistent, in general, with a pseudo-true function limit that is a local average of the true regression function. In this respect nonlinear cointegrating regression differs importantly from conventional linear cointegration which is invariant to time translation. When centred on the pseudo-true function and appropriately scaled, the NW estimator still has a mixed Gaussian limit distribution. The convergence rates are the same as those obtained under correct specification (root h root n, h is a bandwidth term) but the variance of the limit distribution is larger. The practical import of the results for index models, functional regression models, temporal aggregation and specification testing are discussed. Two nonparametric linearity tests are considered. The proposed tests are robust to dynamic misspecification. Under the null hypothesis (linearity), the first test has a chi(2) limit distribution while the second test has limit distribution determined by the maximum of independently distributed chi(2) variates. Under the alternative hypothesis, the test statistics attain a h root n divergence rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It begins by successfully replicating the well-known cross-section association between health and job seniority. Then, however, it turns to longitudinal patterns. Worryingly for the hypothesis, the dataon a large sample of randomly selected British workers through timesuggest that people who start with good health go on later to be promoted. The paper can find relatively little evidence that health improves after promotion. In fact, promoted individuals suffer a significant deterioration in their psychological well-being (on a standard General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) mental ill-health measure).

We derive conditions under which their difference is of a smaller order of magnitude than the inverse of the square root of the sample size in large samples. This result depends crucially on the relation between posterior odds and frequentist model selection criteria. Weak conditions are given under which consistent model selection is feasible, regardless of whether models are nested or nonnested and regardless of whether models are correctly specified or not, in the sense that they select the best model with the least number of parameters with probability converging to 1. Under these conditions, Bayesian posterior odds and BICs are consistent for selecting among nested models, but are not consistent for selecting among nonnested models and possibly overlapping models. These findings have important bearing for applied researchers who are frequent users of model selection tools for empirical investigation of model predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Roessler, C",,,,"Roessler, Christian",,,A limit to price-increasing competition,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Price-increasing competition; Differentiated products; Multidimensional spatial analysis,,"Differentiated entry may cause an incumbent firm to increase its price if the entering brand attracts price-sensitive consumers. This paper generalizes from the known cases with one-dimensional and two-dimensional products, showing for a finite number of attributes that there is scope for price-increasing competition, depending on the entrant's product positioning. The extension is critical because it leads to a reversal that has not been considered. The highest possible duopoly price converges to the monopoly price as the dimensionality increases.

Assessing causal effects of the program is made difficult, however, by missing counterfactuals and systematic underreporting of program participation. Combining survey data with auxiliary administrative information on the size of the NSLP caseload, we extend nonparametric partial identification methods that account for endogenous selection and nonrandom classification error in a single framework. Similar to a regression discontinuity design, we introduce a new way to conceptualize the monotone instrumental variable (MIV) assumption using eligibility criteria as monotone instruments. Under relatively weak assumptions, we find evidence that the receipt of free and reduced-price lunches improves the health outcomes of children. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Different tuberculosis control strategies, which included health-worker, community-member, and family-member directly observed treatment (DOT) and a mobile phone contact-reminder system, were compared with self-administered treatment (SAT). Cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken by using a decision tree model. Costs (2005 international dollars [I$]) were calculated on the basis of treatment periods and treatment outcomes. Health outcomes were estimated over the lifetime of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted on the basis of Thai evidence on the efficacy of the selected strategies. Results: Cost-effectiveness results indicate no preference for any strategy. The uncertainty ranges surrounding the health benefits were wide, including a sizeable probability that SAT could lead to more health gain than DOT strategies. The health gain for family-member DOT was 9400 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval -7200 to 25,000), for community-member DOT was 13,000 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval -21,000 to 37,000), and for health-worker DOT was 7900 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval -50,000 to 43,000). There were cost savings (from less multi-drug resistant tuberculosis treatment) associated with family-member DOT (-I$9 million [95% uncertainty interval -I$12 million to -I$5 million]) because the trial treatment failure rate was significantly lower than that for SAT. The mobile phone reminder system was not cost-effective, because the mortality rate associated with it was much higher than that associated with other treatment strategies. Conclusions: Because of the large uncertainty intervals around health gain for DOT strategies, it remains inconclusive whether DOT strategies are more cost-effective than SAT. It is evident, however, that family-member DOT is a cost-saving intervention.","[Hunchangsith, Pojjana] Mahidol Univ, Inst Populat & Social Res, Phutthamonthon 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Hunchangsith, Pojjana; Vos, Theo; Bertram, Melanie] Minist Publ Hlth, Setting Prior Using Informat Cost Effectiveness P, Nonthaburi, Thailand; [Barendregt, Jan J.; Vos, Theo; Bertram, Melanie] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Ctr Burden Dis & Cost Effectiveness, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Mahidol University; Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; University of Queensland,"Hunchangsith, P (通讯作者)，Mahidol Univ, Inst Populat & Social Res, Phutthamonthon 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",tepsja@gmail.com,"Barendregt, Jan J/F-6895-2010",,"Wellcome Trust, UK [071842/Z/03/Z]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [301199]","Wellcome Trust, UK(Wellcome Trust); National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia)","This work was completed as part of the Setting Priorities using Information on Cost-Effectiveness project, funded by the Wellcome Trust, UK (grant number 071842/Z/03/Z), and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (grant number 301199).",,35,14,19,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S50,S55,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.006,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265067.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000009,0

An outcome below this reference outcome is regarded as resulting from a loss: a loss decreases the decision maker's basic utility more than a comparable gain increases this utility. An elegant and simple way to model this phenomenon was proposed by Shalev (2002): the utility of an outcome below the reference outcome is obtained from the basic utility by subtracting a multiple of the loss in basic utility: this multiple, the loss aversion coefficient, is constant across different reference outcomes. We provide a preference foundation for this loss aversion model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The regression results imply that the illness incidence of adults decreased by 11 percent and their weight-for-height increased by 0.835 kg/m, and that children's weight-for-height and height itself both rose by 0.446 kg/m and 0.962 cm respectively, as a result of the program.

We provide the characterization of a CPM in terms of an induced family of conditional convex risk measures. In the case of indexes these risk measures are coherent. Then, Dynamic Performance Measures (DPMs) are introduced and the problem of time consistency is addressed. The definition of time consistency chosen here ensures that the positions which are considered good tomorrow are already considered good today.

Our model predicts that the elasticity of inebriation with respect to weight is equal to the own-price elasticity of alcohol, consistent with body mass increasing the effective price of inebriation. Given that alcohol is generally considered price inelastic, this result implies that as individuals gain weight, they consume more alcohol but become less inebriated. We test this prediction and find that driver blood alcohol content (BAC) is negatively associated with driver weight. In fatal accidents with driver BAC above 0.10, the driver was 7.8 percentage points less likely to be obese than drivers in fatal accidents that did not involve alcohol. This relationship is not explained by driver attributes (age and sex), driver behaviors (speed and seatbelt use), vehicle attributes (weight class, model year, and number of occupants), or accident context (county of accident, time of day, and day of week).

This paper examines the role of health at birth in determining academic achievement in childhood, which may provide the link between birth weight and adult outcomes. Using three waves of the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data over 1997-2007, we build on the literature by employing the fetal growth rate as a proxy for net nutritional intake in utero and propose a nested error-component two-stage least squares estimator that draws on internal instruments from alternative dimensions of the multilevel panel data set. In particular, this alternative estimator allows us to exploit the information on children with no siblings in the sample, which comprise over 40% of the observations in our sample, as well as to obtain coefficient estimates for the time-invariant variables such as race and maternal education. This would not be feasible with the usual mother fixed effects estimation. We obtain modest but significant effects of both birth weight and the fetal growth rate on math and reading scores, with the effects concentrated in the low birth weight range. Infant health measures appear to explain little of the well-documented racial disparity in test scores.

That is, we have panel data, fixed individual (firm) effects, and the usual stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) composed error. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of this model has been considered by Greene (2005a,b). It is subject to the incidental parameters problem, that is, to possible inconsistency due to the number of parameters growing with the number of firms. In the linear regression model with normal errors, it is known that the MLE of the regression coefficients is consistent, and the inconsistency due to the incidental parameters problem applies only to the error variance. Greene's simulations suggest that the same is true in the fixed effects SFA model. In this paper we take a somewhat different approach. We consider MLE based only on the joint density of the deviations from means. In the linear regression model with normal errors, this estimator is the same as the full MLE for the regression coefficients, but it yields a consistent estimator of the error variance. For the SFA model, the MLE based on the deviations from means is not the same as the full MLE, and it has the advantage of not being subject to the incidental parameters problem. The derivation of the joint density of the deviations from means is made possible by results in the statistical literature on the closed skew normal family of distributions. These results may be of independent interest to researchers in this area. Simulations indicate that our within MLE estimator performs quite well in finite samples. We also present an empirical example. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With risk-rated premiums in the private system and community-rated premiums in the public system, advantageous selection in favor of private insurers is expected. Using 2000 to 2007 data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), we find such selection. While private insurers are unable to select the healthy upon enrollment, they profit from an increase in the probability to switch from private to public health insurance of those individuals who have experienced a negative health shock. To avoid distorted competition between the two branches of health care financing, risk-adjusted transfers from private to public insurers should be instituted.

Methods: To improve on methods of health state valuation for the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, we investigated the performance of different variants of time trade-off and discrete choice tasks in a multinational setting. We also investigated the effect of three modes of administration on health state valuation: group interviews, online self-completion, and face-to-face interviews. Results: The research program provided the basis for the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire valuation protocol. Two different types of tasks are included to derive preferences: a newly developed composite time trade-off task and a forced-choice paired comparisons discrete choice task. Furthermore, standardized blocked designs for the selection of the states to be valued by participants were created and implemented together with all other elements of the valuation protocol in a digital aid, the EuroQol Valuation Technology, which was developed in conjunction with the protocol. Conclusions: The EuroQol Group has developed a standard protocol, with accompanying digital aid and interviewer training materials, that can be used to create value sets for the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. The use of a well-described, consistent protocol across all countries enhances the comparability of value sets between countries, and allows the exploration of the influence of cultural and other factors on health state values.","[Oppe, Mark] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Devlin, Nancy J.] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, HEDS, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Krabbe, Paul F.

Under the partial PPS, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) utilization became relatively more profitable than other procedures, since it was excluded from prospective payments. We find that hospitals have responded to PPS adoption by increasing NICU utilization and by more frequently manipulating infants' reported birth weights which in large part determine their maximum allowable stay in the NICU. This induced demand substantially increases the reimbursements received by hospitals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Data from six European countries for the time period 1991 to 2006 are used to study the cases of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors. Empirical evidence shows that patent expiry of captopril and enalapril led to a switch in total (off-patent originator and generic) consumption towards other in-patent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, whereas patent expiry of omeprazole led to a switch in consumption towards other proton pump inhibitors. This phenomenon makes generic policies ineffective and results in an increase in pharmaceutical expenditure due to the absence of generic alternatives in the market of in-patent molecules.

I consider a consumer (or an investor) who wishes to discount her future income in order to finance her present consumption (investment). Under asymmetric information, such an agent may incur a liquidity constraint (credit rationing). However, the optimal constrained consumption, as a function of future income, resembles a short position of a put option written on future income. This implies that allocating savings to a long call option position on futures may restore the unconstrained relationship between the optimal present consumption and future income. The option on a futures contract is constructed so that the (future) agent's income is correlated with some futures contract (but this is private information) on which the option is issued. The allocation of savings of the borrower to the option on futures turns out to be financially beneficial compared to the allocation of savings to the risk-free investment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Analyzing the Patient Experience in Safety-Net Hospitals,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems; Disproportionate Share Hospital; Hospital Compare; hospital reimbursement,INFORMATION; CARE,"Background: Low-income, publicly insured admissions historically cost more to treat than does the average patient. To ensure that hospitals are reimbursed an adequate amount for care of indigent populations, Medicare reimburses hospitals an additional percentage amount according to federally set financial schedule. At 15% of a disproportionate patient percentage, a hospital is reimbursed an extra 2.5% of the standard prospective payment rate. Objective: This research seeks to determine whether hospital qualification as a Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital results in higher patient experience ratings. Methods: A regression discontinuity method was used to determine the effect of lagged Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) status on next year patient experience ratings. The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems data provide publicly available patient ratings. Results: On average, hospital ratings increase by 6% as a result of DSH status. Hospital ratings increase by an average of 6.5% when nonprofit hospitals are analyzed. This finding is primarily driven by patient facility cleanliness and medical provider communication ratings. Conclusions: The federal mandate that individuals purchase health insurance in the United States coupled with the state expansion of Medicaid coverage will theoretically eliminate the need for Medicare DSH payments. It is calculated, however, that hospitals will need increased Medicaid reimbursements of more than $300 per patient to make up for the loss of Medicare DSH reimbursements. Hospitals will likely suffer financially as a direct result of reduced Medicare reimbursements through the DSH program.","ABT Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",ABT Associates,"Marier, A (通讯作者)，ABT Associates Inc, 55 Wheeler St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Allison_Marier@abtassoc.com,,,,,,,18,7,11,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2014,17,2.0,,,,,231,237,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.12.001,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AD6EB,24636381.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333346600010,0

Furthermore, truth-telling requires the ex-ante allocation to satisfy a non-trivial monotonicity condition. I show that this problem is technically different from the one analyzed in related single agent settings. I provide a procedure to identify the main properties of the ex-post allocation. Typically, the solution does not entail a single reserve price. More specifically, each agent faces an allocation rule contingent on whether his and his rival's types fall below, in or above the (endogenously determined) subset of types that obtain their reservation utility.

The distribution of spouses' bargaining power may change as a result of new outside opportunities that become available to them, so that individual consumption may fluctuate over time. This is what we call bargaining risk. To reduce this risk, spouses may decide to over-invest in marriage-specific capital (which, by definition, is completely lost in the case of divorce) and thereby limit the attractiveness of spouses' outside opportunities. This strategy is shown to be optimal. More surprisingly, over-investment in marriage-specific capital remains an optimal strategy when spouses are confronted with a (small) risk of divorce.

We derive a filtered likelihood from a given quasi likelihood (QL), called a limited information quasi likelihood (LI-QL), that contains relevant but limited information on the data generation process. Our LI-QL approach, in one hand, extends robustness of the QL approach to inference problems for which the existing approach does not apply. Our study in this paper, on the other hand, builds a bridge between the classical and Bayesian approaches for statistical inference under possible model misspecification. We can establish a large sample correspondence between the classical QL approach and our LI-QL based Bayesian approach. An interesting finding is that the asymptotic distribution of an LI-QL based posterior and that of the corresponding quasi maximum likelihood estimator share the same sandwich-type second moment. Based on the LI-QL we can develop inference methods that are useful for practical applications under possible model misspecification.

From a historical point of view, `Tiangong Kaiwu' was a Chinese encyclopedia complied by Song Yingxing that covered a wide range of technical issues in Ancient China with a great number of illustrations. Thus,this paper provides a five-aspect analysis of the illustration aiming to discuss the characteristics of empirical technology in Ancient China. According to `Tiangong Kaiwu', we found that there are following characteristics of the empirical technology in Ancient China: 1) the practicability of the technological system in relation to handicraft industry and farming; 2) the workshop is the main technology scene embodied in the technology activities; 3) craftsmen played important roles as technology operators; 4) direct using the nature force; and 5) the drawing style and level of illustrations matched with the experiential knowledge of the low-level craftsman.","[Luo, Lingling; Zhang, Hui] Northeastern Univ, Res Ctr Hist Sci & Technol, Shenyang, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China,"Luo, LL (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Res Ctr Hist Sci & Technol, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",lll_19500619@126.com; 352522616@qq.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,2,7,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-1685-5,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2014,44,,,,,,173,179,,10.5729/lnms.vol44.173,0.0,,,7,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC9DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356316000028,0

These axioms generate a utilitarian social welfare function implying the use of cost-effectiveness analysis in ordering health projects, based on maximizing the healthy years equivalents gained from a fixed health budget. For projects outside the health sector, our cost-effectiveness axioms imply a form of cost-benefit analysis where both costs and benefits are measured in equivalent healthy life years.

We derive optimal weights for one step ahead forecasts. Under continuous breaks, our approach largely recovers exponential smoothing weights. Under discrete breaks, we provide analytical expressions for optimal weights in models with a single regressor, and asymptotically valid weights for models with more than one regressor. It is shown that in these cases the optimal weight is the same across observations within a given regime and differs only across regimes. In practice, where information on structural breaks is uncertain, a forecasting procedure based on robust optimal weights is proposed. The relative performance of our proposed approach is investigated using Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application to forecasting real GDP using the yield curve across nine industrial economies.

Methods: Our decision-analytical model compared alternative strategies for preventing IFD at up to three clinical decision time points (critical care admission, after 24 hours, and end of day 3), followed with antifungal prophylaxis for those judged high risk versus no formal risk assessment. We developed prognostic models to predict the risk of IFD before critical care unit discharge, with data from 35,455 admissions to 70 UK adult, critical care units, and validated the models externally. The decision model was populated with positive predictive values and negative predictive values from the best-fitting risk models. We projected lifetime cost-effectiveness and expected value of partial perfect information for groups of parameters. Results: The risk prediction models performed well in internal and external validation. Risk assessment and prophylaxis at the end of day 3 was the most cost-effective strategy at the 2% and 1% risk threshold. Risk assessment at each time point was the most cost-effective strategy at a 0.5% risk threshold. Expected values of partial perfect information were high for positive predictive values or negative predictive values (11 pound million-13 pound million) and quality-adjusted life-years (11 pound million). Conclusions: It is cost-effective to formally assess the risk of IFD for non-neutropenic, critically ill adult patients. This integrated approach to developing and evaluating risk models is useful for informing clinical practice and future research investment.","[Sadique, Z.; Grieve, R.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Harrison, D.

This assumption of consumer inertia causes (noncooperative) coordination on high prices only to be possible as an equilibrium for low values of the discount factor. High discount factors increase opportunism and aggressiveness of competition to such an extent that high prices are no longer sustainable as an equilibrium outcome.

Using the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure (which subtracts out-of-pocket medical expenses from family resources), we estimated the impact of eliminating Medicaid. In our counterfactual, Medicaid beneficiaries would become uninsured or gain other insurance. Counterfactual medical expenditures were drawn stochastically from propensity-score-matched individuals without Medicaid. While this method captures the importance of risk protection, it likely underestimates Medicaid's impact due to unobserved differences between Medicaid and non-Medicaid individuals. Nonetheless, we find that Medicaid reduces out-of-pocket medical spending from $871 to $376 per beneficiary, and decreases poverty rates by 1.0% among children, 2.2% among disabled adults, and 0.7% among elderly individuals. When factoring in institutionalized populations, an additional 500,000 people were kept out of poverty.

Previous studies have resorted to inherently incomplete outcome measures such as mortality or re-admission rates to assess this claim. This study makes use of a novel dataset of routinely collected patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) linked to inpatient records to (i) access the degree to which cost variation is associated with variation in patients' health gain and (ii) explore how far judgement about hospital cost performance changes when health outcomes are accounted for. We use multilevel modelling to address the clustering of patients in providers and isolate unexplained cost variation. We find some evidence of a U-shaped relationship between risk-adjusted costs and outcomes for hip replacement surgery. For three other procedures (knee replacement, varicose vein and groin hernia surgery), the estimated relationship is sensitive to the choice of PROM instrument. We do not observe substantial changes in cost performance estimates when outcomes are explicitly accounted for.

Methods: An electronic search was undertaken of articles published between 1979 and 2009, without language restriction, that focused on interventions to improve antihypertensive medication adherence among patients (>= 18 years) with essential hypertension. Studies must have measured adherence as an outcome of the intervention. We followed standard guidelines for the conduct and reporting of the review and conducted a narrative synthesis of reported data. Results: Ninety-seven articles were identified for inclusion; 35 (35 of 97, 36.1%) examined interventions to directly improve medication adherence, and the majority (58 of 97, 59.8%) were randomized controlled trials. Thirty-four (34 of 97, 35.1%) studies reported a statistically significant improvement in medication adherence. Discussion/Conclusions: Interventions aimed at improving patients' knowledge of medications possess the greatest potential clinical value in improving adherence with antihypertensive therapy. However, we identified several limitations of these studies, and advise future researchers to focus on using validated adherence measures, well-designed randomized controlled trials with relevant adherence and clinical outcomes, and guidelines on the appropriate design and analysis of adherence research.","[Gwadry-Sridhar, Femida H.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, London, ON, Canada; [Gwadry-Sridhar, Femida H.; Ratzki-Leewing, Alexandria] Lawson Hlth Res Inst, I THINK Res, London, ON, Canada; [Manias, Elizabeth] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Hlth Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Lal, Lincy] Ingenix, Ingenix Consulting, Houston, TX USA; [Salas, Maribel] Univ Penn, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Salas, Maribel; Grubisic, Maja] AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE USA; [Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Econ & Policy Hlth, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Grubisic, Maja] Prov Hlth Care, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Melbourne; University of Pennsylvania; AstraZeneca; Bangor University,"Gwadry-Sridhar, FH (通讯作者)，268 Grosvenor St,Room FB-112, London, ON N6A 4V2, Canada.",femida.gwadry-sridhar@lhsc.on.ca,"Manias, Elizabeth/D-2035-2009; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Manias, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3747-0087; Ratzki-Leewing, Alexandria/0000-0002-9474-7900; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459",International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,Sources of support: We acknowledge the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research for the funding of a summer student to help with the extraction.,,143,110,120,0,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2013,16,5.0,,,,,863,871,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.03.1631,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CL,23947982.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325466600022,0

This article presents a framework to simultaneously support these three decisions from a societal perspective. The framework is applied to the 70-gene signature, a gene-expression profile for breast cancer, deciding which patients should receive adjuvant systemic therapy after surgery. The original signature performed on fresh frozen tissue (70G-FFT) could be further developed to a paraffin-based signature (70G-PAR) to reduce test failures. Methods: A Markov decision model comparing the current guideline Adjuvant Online (AO), 70G-FFT, and 70G-PAR was used to simulate 20-year costs and outcomes in a hypothetical cohort in The Netherlands. The 70G-PAR strategy was based on projected data from a comparable technology. Incremental net monetary benefits were calculated to support the adoption decision. Expected net benefit of development for the population and expected net benefit of sampling were calculated to support the development and research decision. Results: The 70G-PAR had the highest net monetary benefit, followed by the 70G-FFT. The population expected net benefit of development amounted to (sic)91 million over 20 years (assuming (sic)250 development costs per patient receiving the test). The expected net benefit of sampling amounted to (sic)61 million for the optimal trial (n = 4000). Conclusions: We presented a framework to simultaneously support adoption, development, and research decisions in early stages of medical technology development. In this case, the results indicate that there is value in both further development of 70G-FFT into 70G-PAR and further research.","[Retel, Valesca P.; van Harten, Wim H.] Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hosp NKI AVL, Netherlands Canc Inst, Dept Psychosocial Res & Epidemiol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Grutters, Janneke P.

However, as mentioned by others, it is not clear if and how such a method can be extended to calculate the expected value of sample information (EVSI). In this article, we provide a nonparametric definition for EVPI and EVSI, which is based on considering the entire population distribution as the uncertain entity for which the current RCT provides partial information. This enables a theoretical justification for using the bootstrap for EVPI calculation and allows us to propose a two-level resampling method for EVSI calculation. What is considered as the sampling unit in this algorithm can range from the individual level net benefits to the full panel of the RCT data for an individual, enabling the analyst to decide on a trade-off between computational efficiency and comprehensiveness in value of information analysis. As such, we argue that this method, in addition to being consistent with the popular bootstrap method of RCT-based economic evaluations, is a flexible approach for EVPI and EVSI calculations.

These often target a small population, have data based on smaller clinical trials, are expensive, and may have questionable advantage. This is a result of how the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves medications, which is based only on safety and efficacy. Cancer drugs, once approved by the FDA, regardless of cost or value must be covered by Medicare. Some states have laws requiring additional coverage as well. All of this has created an unintended consequence: It has driven up costs with questionable evidence to support the medication's value, placing patients, payers, and providers in an ethical conflict. In this new era of health care transformation, health care leaders must focus on creating value to support a sustainable health system. Christiana Care Health System's Value Institute has designed a new model to evaluate specialty medications, using value as its main criterion. Methods: This article describes the process and outcomes using a new value model for evaluating specialty medications for a hospital formulary. It also introduces a new criterion of evaluation entitled Societal Benefit that provides a rating on quality- of-life issues. With measurable factors of efficacy, risk, cost, and quality-of-life concerns, our methodology provides a more balanced approach in the evaluation of specialty medications. Results: Specialty medications are the fastest growing segment of drug expense, and it is hard to understand how these medications will be sustainable under health care reforms. Unlike other countries, the United States has no national agency providing cost-effectiveness review; review occurs, if at all, at a local level. Laws governing Medicare and most private insurers' coverage of FDA-approved medication and some clinical quality standards conflict with cost-effectiveness, making this type of review difficult. Finally, because these medications affect the health system as a whole, it is a great example to begin to support health care reform. Conclusions: Hospitals need to challenge the value of specialty medication. Although our model will continue to evolve, value is now our central consideration when selecting specialty medications to be added to the formulary.

Our testing procedure utilizes the infinitesimal operator-based martingale characterization combined with a generalized spectral approach. Such a testing procedure is feasible and convenient because the infinitesimal operator of the diffusion process has a closed-form expression. The proposed test is applicable to both univariate and multivariate processes and has an N(0, 1) limit distribution under the diffusion hypothesis. Simulation and empirical studies show that the proposed test has reasonable performance in small samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The intertemporal preferences of individuals are represented by a model of recursive rank dependent utility, which has the advantage of allowing risk perceptions to vary over time and with health status. The main results of the paper are the following. Concerning the impact of risk perception on prevention, two types of pessimists have to be distinguished: the moderate pessimists and the fatalists. Both types overestimate the probability of disease, but the fatalists underestimate the reduction of the disease probability by prevention. Risk perception modification after the occurrence of the disease influences prevention decisions. Indeed, we show that moderate pessimists often choose a high level of primary and tertiary prevention, but a moderate pessimist who becomes fatalist after the occurrence of the disease may choose a high level of primary prevention and a low level of tertiary prevention.

Score tests are a natural application, and in general a variety of tests can be heavy-tail robustified by our method, including white noise, GARCH affects, omitted variables, distribution, functional form, causation, volatility spillover and over-identification. The test statistic is derived from a tail-trimmed sample version of the moments evaluated at a consistent plug-in (theta) over cap (T) for theta(0). Depending on the test in question and heaviness of tails, (theta) over cap (T) may be any consistent estimator including sub-T-1/2-convergent and/or asymptotically non-Gaussian ones, since (theta) over cap (T) can be assured not to affect the test statistic asymptotically. We adapt bootstrap, p-value occupation time, and covariance determinant methods for selecting the trimming fractile in any sample, and apply our statistic to tests of white noise, omitted variables and volatility spillover. We find it obtains sharp empirical size and strong power, while conventional tests exhibit size distortions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The UK Food Standards Agency initiated a campaign at the end of 2004 to reduce salt intake in the population. There is disagreement over whether the campaign was effective in curbing salt intake or not. We provide fresh evidence on the impact of the campaign, by using data on spot urinary sodium readings and socio-demographic variables from the Health Survey for England over 2003-2007 and combining it with food price information from the Expenditure and Food Survey. Aggregating the data into a pseudo-panel, we estimate fixed effects models to examine the trend in salt intake over the period and to deduce the heterogeneous effects of the policy on the intake of socio-demographic groups. Our results are consistent with a previous hypothesis that the campaign reduced salt intakes by approximately 10%. The impact is shown to be stronger among women than among men. Older cohorts of men show a larger response to the salt campaign compared to younger cohorts, while among women, younger cohorts respond more strongly than older cohorts.

Here we develop and implement a novel method for utilizing interstate heterogeneity to estimate the aggregate effects of a federal tax increase on rates of injury fatality and crime. We provide evidence that the relative importance of alcohol in violence and injury rates is directly related to per capita consumption, and build on that finding to generate estimates. A conservative estimate is that the federal tax (which increased alcohol prices by 6% initially) reduced injury deaths by 4.5% (6480 deaths), in 1991, and had a still larger effect on violent crime.

This study aims to explore how children use open space in the Zhonghaifuyuan neighborhood located between the second and third ring road in Beijing, China. The neighborhood is representative of many contemporary high-rise residential areas in Beijing. 456 children between 3-11 years of age were observed during the time period of winter 2008-until summer 2011, using a fixed-point observation and tracking to obtain information on their perceptions about opportunities for physical activity and the characteristics of play spaces for children. Our study found that child care or supervision during play activities greatly influences the level of children's outdoor physical activities, as well as the locations and play processes of children. Second, the study discovered that activity facilities within the playground and the 'pre-playground' area with diverse landscape elements, such as circular paths around those areas, support and encourage higher levels of physical activity. Third, the study revealed the benefit and interplay of the natural environment including water, topography, and plants, with the built environment and its man-made elements such as pavement, artificial structures/pathways and public works of art, that provide more and improved possibilities for an increased level of children's physical activity.

The aims of this study were 1) to provide an overview of how mapping is currently used as reported in the published literature and in an HTA policy-making context, specifically at the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom, and 2) to comment on best current practice on the use of mapping for HTA more generally. The review of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance found that mapping has been used since first established but that reporting of the models used to map has been poor. Recommendations for mapping in HTA include an explicit consideration of the generalizability of the mapping function to the target sample, reporting of standard econometric and statistical tests including the degree of error in the mapping model across subsets of the range of utility values, and validation of the model(s). Mapping can provide a route for linking outcomes data collected in a trial or observational study to the specific preferred instrument for obtaining utility values. In most cases, however, it is still advantageous to directly collect data by using the preferred utility-based instrument and mapping should usually be viewed as a second-best solution.","[Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Rowen, Donna] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Brunel University; University of Sheffield,"Longworth, L (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Louise.longworth@brunel.ac.uk,,"Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109",National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence through its Decision Support Unit; Decision Support Unit of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence through its Decision Support Unit; Decision Support Unit of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,"The production of this document was funded by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence through its Decision Support Unit.

Two main results are shown. Firstly, a bootstrap Invariance Principle is derived pointwise in i, obtaining an upper bound for the order of truncation of the AR polynomial that depends on n and T. Consistent estimation of the long run variances is also studied for (n, T) -> infinity. Secondly, joint bootstrap asymptotics is also studied, investigating the conditions under which the bootstrap is valid. In particular, the extent of cross sectional dependence which can be allowed for is investigated. Whilst we show that, for general forms of cross dependence, consistent estimation of the long run variance (and therefore validity of the bootstrap) is fraught with difficulties, however we show that one-cross-sectional-unit-at-a-time resampling schemes yield valid bootstrap based inference under weak forms of cross-sectional dependence.

Our intent-to-treat estimates show that expanding health insurance has significant effects on self-reported health at one year following health insurance enrollment, positive effects on mental health and physical health at one year following health insurance enrollment, and no significant effects on mortality within our observation period. About 30% of control group members obtained health insurance coverage within one year following enrollment. We use two-stage least square models to estimate the impact on those who would not have obtained health insurance coverage without the demonstration project and find larger effects on self-reported health and mental health among these SSDI beneficiaries. Finally, we examine distributional impacts to show that mean impacts miss meaningful effects.

Contrary to statements in the original papers, our analytical results establish that the ratio-based break point estimators of Kim [Kim, J.Y., 2000.

Tests of stationarity against a change in persistence. Journal of Econometrics 123, 33-66] are inconsistent when a mean (or other deterministic component) is estimated for the process. In such cases, the estimators converge to random variables with upper bound given by the true break date when persistence changes from I(0) to I(1). A Monte Carlo study confirms the large sample downward bias and also finds substantial biases in moderate sized samples, partly due to properties at the end points of the search interval.

Our results extend those of Chamberlain (1992b) and Ai and Chen (2003) for semiparametric conditional moment restrictions with identical information sets to the case of nested information sets, and those of Chamberlain (1992a) and Brown and Newey (1998) for models of sequential moment restrictions without unknown functions to cases with unknown functions of possibly endogenous variables. Our results are applicable to semiparametric panel data models and two stage plug-in problems. As an important example, we compute the efficiency bound for a weighted average derivative of a nonparametric instrumental variables regression (NPIV), and find that simple plug-in NPIV estimators are not efficient. We present an optimally weighted, orthogonalized, sieve minimum distance estimator that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

High quality premium and low quality punishment are found to depend on how the impact of marginal costs on quality relates to the intensity of the network effect and the optimism of the producer about final demand. More precisely, marginal costs have to be low enough (but not too low) with respect to the intensity of the network effects and/or the optimism about final demand so that higher prices reflect higher quality. A similar conclusion can be drawn about incentives for quality provision, whenever quality is considered endogenous together with price. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By adopting a hierarchical model, we provide a solution for determining optimal sample size with this assumption relaxed. The solution is illustrated with two examples from the literature. Expected net gain increases with increasing between-study variation, reflecting the increased uncertainty in incremental net benefit and reduced extent to which data are borrowed from previous evidence. Hence, a trial can become optimal where current evidence is sufficient assuming no between-study variation.

Each member of the family assigns an agent part of the cost of connecting him to his immediate predecessor, and all of his followers are equally responsible for the remaining part. We characterize the family by imposing the axioms of efficiency, non-negativity, independence of following costs, group independence, and weak first-link consistency. The Bird and the sequential equal contributions rules are two distinguished members of the family. The Bird rule is obtained by requiring an agent to pay the entire cost of connecting him to his immediate predecessor, and the sequential equal contributions rule is obtained by requiring an agent and each of his followers to be equally responsible for this cost. We show how each of these two rules can be singled out from the family. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.

Of particular interest is whether the health production function has constant returns to scale, as in the standard Grossman model, or decreasing returns to scale, as in the EhrlichChuma model and extensions thereof. The model with decreasing returns to scale has a number of theoretically and empirically desirable characteristics that the constant returns model does not have. Although our empirical equation does not point-identify the decreasing returns to scale curvature parameter, it does allow us to test for constant versus decreasing returns to scale. The results are suggestive of decreasing returns and in line with prior estimates from the literature. But when we attempt to control for the endogeneity of health by using instrumental variables, the results become inconclusive. This brings into question the robustness of prior estimates in this literature.

The paper explores consequences for organizational design of a theorem (attributed to Von Neumann by Moore and Shannon) on how to build reliable networks using unreliable components. The paper examines general properties of committee decision making and shows the superiority of committees with respect to composition, that is when each member of organization is replaced by a replica of the entire organization. The paper links with the modern Condorcet Jury Theorem literature. It also shows that organizational screening performance is sigmoid in individual screening performance for hierarchies of polyarchies and for polyarchies of hierarchies. The supermodularity and sub-modularity properties of organizations' screening performance allows us to link with results from the theory of teams. When agents are heterogeneous, hierarchies favor sorting and polyarchies favor mixing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The asymptotic distributions of least squares (LS), infeasible generalized least squares (GLS), and feasible GLS estimators and t statistics are determined. The GLS procedures allow for misspecification of the form of the conditional heteroskedasticity and, hence, are referred to as quasi-GLS procedures. The asymptotic results are established for drifting sequences of the autoregressive parameter rho(n) and the distribution of the time series of innovations. In particular, we consider the full range of cases in which rho(n) satisfies n(1 - rho(n)) -> infinity and n(1 - rho(n)) -> h(1) is an element of vertical bar 0, infinity) as n -> infinity, where n is the sample size.

Deriving model selection criteria for the leads-and-lags regression is a nontrivial task since the true model is of infinite dimension. This paper justifies using the conventional formulas of those model selection criteria for the leads-and-lags cointegrating regression. The numbers of leads and lags can be selected in scientific ways using the model selection criteria. Simulation results regarding the bias and mean squared error of the long-run coefficient estimates are reported. It is found that the model selection criteria are successful in reducing bias and mean squared error relative to the conventional, fixed selection rules. Among the model selection criteria, the BIC appears to be most successful in reducing MSE, and C-p in reducing bias. We also observe that, in most cases, the selection rules without the restriction that the numbers of the leads and lags be the same have an advantage over those with it. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

There exist two types of agents: the first correctly anticipates all future contingent endogenous variables with complete information as in Radner [Radner, R. (1972). Existence of equilibrium of plans, prices and price expectations in a sequence of markets. Econometrica, 289-303] and the second has exogenous expectations about the future environment as in Grandmont [Grandmont, J. M. (1977). Temporary general equilibrium theory. Econometrica, 535-572] and information based on the current and past aggregate variables including those which are private knowledge. Agents with exogenous expectations may have inconsistent optimal plans but have predictive beliefs in the context of Blackwell and Dubbins [Blackwell, D., Dubins, L (1962). Merging of opinions with increasing information. The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 882-886] with probability transition rules based on all observed variables. We provide examples of this framework applied to models of differential information and environments exhibiting results of market selection and convergence of an equilibrium. The existence result can be used to conclude that, by adding the continuity assumption on the probability transition rules, we obtain the existence of an equilibrium for some models of differential information and incomplete markets.

Mother's health, child characteristics, prenatal care, socioeconomic status (SES), and the socioeconomic and healthcare environment of mother's community are important inputs into the birthweight production function, and a vast literature has delved into obtaining causal estimates of their effect on infant health. What is unknown is how much of the racial gap in LBW is explained by all these inputs together. We apply a nonlinear extension of the OaxacaBlinder method proposed by Fairlie to decompose this gap into the portion explained by differences in observed characteristics and the portion that remains unexplained. Data are obtained from several sources in order to capture as many observables as possible, although the primary data source is the Natality Detail Files. Results show that of the 6.8 percentage point racial gap in LBW, only 0.91.9 points are explained by whiteblack differences in endowments across those measures, and of those endowments, most of the gap in LBW is explained by the differences in SES. The unexplained difference is attributed to racial differences in the returns to or the marginal product of investments in infant health.

Methods: Five panels covering the years 1999 to 2008 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided interview, demographic, and laboratory data for 8769 (365,503,838 weighted) people aged 20 years or older who were not taking a statin medication. An individual's risk for coronary heart disease and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal were determined, following the Adult Treatment Panel III Cholesterol Guidelines. The percentage LDL cholesterol lowering required to reach his/her LDL cholesterol level goal was calculated. Depending on the amount of LDL cholesterol lowering needed and on if the individual had a liver condition (i.e., enhanced risk of rhabdomyolysis) statins were hypothetically prescribed. Predicted use was compared to actual use by US Medicaid beneficiaries in the third quarter of 2009, obtained from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Results: Results showed that 72.34% of the population was in the lowest coronary heart disease risk group and that 86.30% required no statin therapy. Among the people who did require LDL cholesterol lowering, a significant majority (37.3 million or 10.22% of the population) needed 30% lowering or less. Only 314,784 (0.09%) required LDL cholesterol lowering of greater than 60%. Utilization shares based on safety and efficacy were estimated at 19.26% (rosuvastatin), 18.67% (atorvastatin), 16.48% (simvastatin), 16.30% (lovastatin), 14.93% (pravastatin), and 14.36% (fluvastatin). Conclusions: Actual statin use differed substantially from predicted use. It may be appropriate to develop and maintain policies that encourage use of less costly products that have essentially equivalent safety profiles and efficacy.","[Kelton, Christina M.

The MacNew Heart Disease health-related quality of life questionnaire has been validated in English-speaking patients with myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to validate the MacNew in English-speaking patients with angina or ischemic heart failure. Methods: Canadian and American patients with angina or ischemic heart failure completed the MacNew, the Short Form-36 Health Survey, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: We administered questionnaires to 276 patients with angina (mean age, 65.9 years) and 155 patients with ischemic heart failure (mean age, 70.3 years). The mean +/- SD MacNew global score in patients with ischemic heart failure (5.1 +/- 1.2) was statistically (P < 0.001), but not clinically, poorer than in patients with angina (5.3 +/- 1.1). The three-factor measurement model explained 46.1% of the observed variance in the MacNew in patients with angina and 46.5% in patients with ischemic heart failure. Internal consistency was >= 0.90, and test-retest reliability was >= 0.70 for each MacNew scale and the a priori convergent and discriminative validity hypotheses were confirmed in both diagnoses. The MacNew was highly accepted by patients with little respondent or administrative burden. Conclusions: The English version of the MacNew is reliable and valid in patients with angina or ischemic heart failure. This permits health-related quality of life outcome comparisons in patients with angina, ischemic heart failure, and myocardial infarction with the MacNew and provides a better understanding of the full range of health-related quality of life outcomes.","[Hoefer, Stefan] Innsbruck Med Univ, Dept Med Psychol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Saleem, Atif] Seton Hall & St Josephs Reg Med Ctr, Paterson, NJ USA; [Stone, James] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Cardiac Wellness Inst, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Thomas, Randal] Mayo Clin & Mayo Fdn, Rochester, MN USA; [Tulloch, Heather] Univ Ottawa, Inst Heart, MINTO Prevent & Rehabil Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Oldridge, Neil] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Oldridge, Neil] Aurora Sinai Aurora St Lukes Med Ctr, Publ Hlth Serv, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Oldridge, Neil] Aurora Sinai Aurora St Lukes Med Ctr, Aurora Cardiovasc Serv, Milwaukee, WI USA",Medical University of Innsbruck; University of Calgary; Mayo Clinic; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa Heart Institute; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; United States Public Health Service,"Höfer, S (通讯作者)，Innsbruck Med Univ, Dept Med Psychol, Speckbacherstr 23-3, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",stefan.hoefer@i-med.ac.at,"Stone, J M/H-9424-2019; Höfer, Stefan/B-8393-2008; Höfer, Stefan/N-8253-2019","Stone, J M/0000-0003-3051-0135; Höfer, Stefan/0000-0002-6128-3687; Thomas, Randal/0000-0003-1448-7182",European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation; European Society of Cardiology,European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation; European Society of Cardiology,"We thank T.

Methods: Documentary reviews supplemented by experiences of policymakers. Results: National health insurance policy in all the three countries has been developed toward coverage for all. It leads to higher health-care expenditures and requires a good reimbursement system for health-care services, including drugs. Drug reimbursement decision-making in these countries is to develop a reimbursement list with the help of various committees having different roles. Primarily, they assess the clinical and safety evidence. Economic evidence, including budget impact and pharmacoeconomic evaluation, has also been very important for their reimbursement decision-making. This evidence is sometimes used in negotiation mechanism, which allows pharmaceutical companies to lower their drug prices and leads to lower overall drug expenditures. Several common barriers, for example, human capacity and data availability, for obtaining economic evidence in all the three countries, however, still exist. Conclusions: Drug reimbursement decision-making in Thailand, China, and South Korea is in its transition period. It seems to run in the same direction, for example, guideline development and pharmacoeconomic evaluation agency establishment. Pharmacoeconomic evaluation plays important roles in the efficiency of drug reimbursement decision-making, even though there are several barriers to be overcome.","[Ngorsuraches, Surachat] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Hat Yai 90112, Songkhla, Thailand; [Meng, Wei] China Hlth Insurance Res Assoc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kim, Bo-Yeon] Hlth Insurance Review & Assessment Serv, Seoul, South Korea; [Kulsomboon, Vithaya] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Bangkok, Thailand",Prince of Songkla University; Chulalongkorn University,"Ngorsuraches, S (通讯作者)，Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Hat Yai 90112, Songkhla, Thailand.",surachat.n@psu.ac.th,,"Ngorsuraches, Surachat/0000-0002-2327-224X",,,,,4,35,39,0,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S120,S125,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.002,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265058.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000022,0

In contrast to classical fixed effects models with conditional mean restrictions, conditional quantile restrictions are not preserved by taking differences in the regression equation over time. This paper shows however that a conditional quantile restriction, in conjunction with a weak conditional independence restriction, provides bounds on quantiles of differences in time-varying unobservables across periods. These bounds carry observable implications for model parameters which generally result in set identification. The analysis of these bounds includes conditions for point identification of the parameter vector, as well as weaker conditions that result in point identification of individual parameter components.

When faced with a choice between various innovation options, it is, therefore, possible that some respondents eliminate and/or select innovations based on certain characteristics. This paper proposes a flexible method for exploring and accommodating situations where respondents exhibit such behaviours, whilst addressing preference heterogeneity. We present an empirical case study on the public's preferences for health service innovations. We show that allowing for elimination-by-aspects and/or selection-by-aspects behavioural rules leads to substantial improvements in model fit and, importantly, has implications for willingness to pay estimates and scenario analysis.

Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of telaprevir plus PR compared with PR alone in 1) previously untreated patients and 2) patients who had received treatment with PR earlier. Methods: Sustained virological response rates and average treatment durations of telaprevir and PR (given with or without telaprevir) were taken from the telaprevir ADVANCE and REALIZE clinical trials but were modified to take account of differences in prescribing rules between the trials and Australian clinical practice. The probability of transitioning between Markov disease states was based on data from the Australian Kirby Institute where possible and supplemented using data from the published literature. Utility values obtained from the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire data collected in the ADVANCE and REALIZE trials were used to represent the utility during HCV treatment. Utility values for Markov health states were taken from the published literature. Unit costs (2014 AU $) were taken from Australian sources. Results: In treatment naive patients, the discounted cost per life-years gained was AU $37,706 and the discounted cost per quality-adjusted life year was AU $19,283.

The existence of asset bubbles increases the equilibrium interest rate. Although the increased interest rate excludes less productive agents from production activity, these agents benefit from the liquidity of an intrinsically useless asset, rolling over the asset to the next period. As a result, allocative inefficiency is corrected, and capital accumulation can be promoted. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Tejada, O; Borm, P; Lohmann, E",,,,"Tejada, O.; Borm, P.; Lohmann, E.",,,A unifying model for matrix-based pairing situations,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"We present a unifying framework for transferable utility coalitional games that are derived from a non-negative matrix in which every entry represents the value obtained by combining the corresponding row and column. We assume that every row and every column is associated with a player, and that every player is associated with at most one row and at most one column. The instances arising from this framework are called pairing games, and they encompass assignment games and permutation games as two polar cases. We show that the core of a pairing game is always non-empty by proving that the set of pairing games coincides with the set of permutation games. Then we exploit the wide range of situations comprised in our framework to investigate the relationship between pairing games that have different player sets, but are defined by the same underlying matrix. We show that the core and the set of extreme core allocations are immune to the merging of a row player with a column player. Moreover, the core is also immune to the reverse manipulation, i.e., to the splitting of a player into a row player and a column player. Other common solution concepts fail to be either merging-proof or splitting-proof in general. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These contaminations include processes whose spectral density functions dominate at low frequencies such as random level shifts, deterministic level shifts and deterministic trends. We show that our modified estimator has the usual asymptotic distribution applicable for the standard local Whittle estimator in the absence of such contaminations. We also show how the estimator can be modified to further account for additive noise and that our modification for low frequency contamination reduces the bias due to short-memory dynamics. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed estimator provides substantial efficiency gains compared to existing semiparametric estimators in the presence of contaminations, with little loss of efficiency when these are absent.

Because of the indivisibility, the preference maximization does not imply the expenditure minimization. An expenditure-minimizing Walrasian equilibrium is a state where, under some price vector, all agents satisfy both the preference maximization and the expenditure minimization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate a two-stage nested logit model of demand, and on the basis of an oligopolistic model of multi-product firms, we then recover the marginal costs and markups. We finally evaluate the effect of the parallel imports' policy by calculating a counterfactual scenario without parallel trade. According to our estimates, parallel imports reduce the prices for patented drugs by 11% and do not have a significant effect on prices for generic drugs. This amounts to an increase in the demand-side surplus by (sic)19 million per year (or (sic)130 million in total), which is relatively small compared with the average annual market size of around (sic)227 million based on ex-factory prices. The variable profits for the manufacturers of original drugs from the German market are reduced by (sic)18 million (or 37%) per year when parallel trade is allowed, yet only one third of this difference is appropriated by the importers.

Although the effects of child care subsidies on maternal employment and child development have been recently studied, many other dimensions of family well-being have received little attention. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the impact of child care subsidy receipt on maternal health and the quality of child-parent interactions. The empirical analyses use data from three nationally representative surveys, providing access to numerous measures of family well-being. In addition, we attempt to handle the possibility of non-random selection into subsidy receipt by using several identification strategies both within and across the surveys. Our results consistently indicate that child care subsidies are associated with worse maternal health and poorer interactions between parents and their children. In particular, subsidized mothers report lower levels of overall health and are more likely to show symptoms consistent with anxiety, depression, and parenting stress. Such mothers also reveal more psychological and physical aggression toward their children and are more likely to utilize spanking as a disciplinary tool. Together, these findings suggest that work-based public policies aimed at economically disadvantaged mothers may ultimately undermine family well-being.

But asymptotic approximations can easily be unreliable in such cases, for standard regularity conditions may not apply or may hold only weakly. This paper proposes finite-sample tests and confidence sets for tail thickness and asymmetry parameters (alpha and beta) of stable distributions. The confidence sets are built by inverting exact goodness-of-fit tests for hypotheses which assign specific values to these parameters. We propose extensions of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk and Filliben criteria, as well as the quantile-based statistics proposed by McCulloch (1986) in order to better capture tail behavior. The suggested criteria compare empirical goodness-of-fit or quantile-based measures with their hypothesized values. Since the distributions involved are quite complex and non-standard, the relevant hypothetical measures are approximated by simulation, and p-values are obtained using Monte Carlo (MC) test techniques. The properties of the proposed procedures are investigated by simulation. In contrast with conventional wisdom, we find reliable results with sample sizes as small as 25. The proposed methodology is applied to daily electricity price data in the US over the period 2001-2006. The results show clearly that heavy kurtosis and asymmetry are prevalent in these series.

There has been debate over which method is more appropriate when making resource allocation decisions. Objective: This article informs this debate by assessing whether differences between these methods have an effect on the mean EQ-5D-3L tariff scores of different patient groups. Methods: The European tariff based on GHS valuations was compared with a German EHS tariff. Comparison was made in the context of EQ-5D-3L health states describing a number of diagnosed chronic diseases (stroke, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and cancer) taken from the Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region population surveys. Comparison was made of both the difference in weighting of the dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L and differences in mean tariff scores for patient groups. Results: Weighting of the dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L were found to be systematically different. The EHS tariff gave significantly lower mean scores for most, but not all, patient groups despite tariff scores being lower for 213 of 243 EQ-5D-3L health states using the GHS tariff. Differences were found to vary between groups, with the largest change in difference being 5.45 in the multiple stoke group. Conclusions: The two tariffs have systematic differences that in certain patient groups could drive the results of an economic evaluation. Therefore, the choice as to which is used may be critical when making resource allocation decisions.","[Little, Matthew H.

Both are grounded in expected utility theory but impose strong assumptions about the form of the utility function. Preference elicitation tasks for both are complicated, limiting the number of health states that each respondent can value and, therefore, that can be valued overall. The usual approach has been to value a set of the possible health states and impute values for the remainder. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) offer an attractive alternative, allowing investigation of more flexible specifications of the utility function and greater coverage of the response surface. We designed a DCE to obtain values for EQ-5D health states and implemented it in an Australia-representative online panel (n = 1,031). A range of specifications investigating non-linear preferences with respect to time and interactions between EQ-5D levels were estimated using a random-effects probit model. The results provide empirical support for a flexible utility function, including at least some two-factor interactions. We then constructed a preference index such that full health and death were valued at 1 and 0, respectively, to provide a DCE-based algorithm for Australian cost-utility analyses.

Objectives: 1) To estimate the proportion of studies that identified SES as a potential risk indicator of nonadherence, 2) to describe the type of SES measurements, and 3) to quantify the association between SES and nonadherence to antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis research design was used. We searched multiple electronic databases for studies in English or French examining nonadherence to antihypertensive medications measured by electronic prescription databases where explanatory factors were considered. Two authors independently assessed quality, described the SES measure(s), and recorded its association with nonadherence to antihypertensives. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed, and heterogeneity was examined by using the 12 statistic. Results: Fifty-six studies with 4,780,293 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-four of these studies (43%) did not report any SES measures. When it was reported (n = 32), only seven (13%) examined more than one component but none performed a multidimensional assessment. Most of the studies relied on income or income-related measures (such as prescription-drug benefits or co-payments) (27 of 32 [84%]). meta-analysis could be quantified in 40 cohorts reported in 30 studies. Overall, the pooled adjusted risk estimate for nonadherence according to SES (high vs low) was 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.87-0.92; l(2) = 95%; P < 0.001). Similar patterns were observed in all subgroups examined. Conclusions: Published studies have not found a strong association between low SES and nonadherence to antihypertensive medications. However, important limitations in the assessment of SES can be identified in virtually all studies. Future studies are required to ascertain whether a stronger association is observed when SES is determined by comprehensive measures.","[Alsabbagh, M. H. D.

The remaining 22 questions belong to an overall credibility domain and pertain to assessments about whether the network meta analysis results provide a valid answer to the question they are designed to answer by examining 1) the used evidence base, 2) analysis methods, 3) reporting quality and transparency, 4) interpretation of findings, and 5) conflicts of interest. The questionnaire aims to help readers of network meta-analysis opine about their confidence in the credibility and applicability of the results of a network meta-analysis, and help make decision makers aware of the subtleties involved in the analysis of networks of randomized trial evidence.

Cost effectiveness analysis of healthcare investment options presents the effectiveness of a particular action in proportion to the resources required, and cost effectiveness thresholds, while somewhat arbitrary, define the level at which the investment can be considered value for money. Currently, cost effectiveness thresholds reflect the national budget context or willingness-to-pay, which is problematic when making cross-country comparisons. Defining a global minimum monetary value for the disability adjusted life year (DALY) would in effect set a global baseline cost effectiveness threshold. A global minimum DALY value would reflect a universal minimum value on human health, irrespective of a national provider's willingness or ability to pay. A minimum DALY value and associated threshold has both limitations and flaws but is justified on similar grounds to the Millennium Development Goals or the absolute poverty threshold and has the potential to radically improve transparency and efficiency of priority setting in global health.

For fictitious play process with incomplete learning, we discuss the absorbability of Nash equilibriums and the consistency of utilities in a finite game and discuss the convergence in a 2 x 2 game with an identical learning-period set. The main results for incomplete learning models are that, if it is uniformly played, a strict Nash equilibrium is absorbing in a fictitious play process; a fictitious play has the property of utility consistency if it exhibits infrequent switches and players learn frequently enough; a 2 x 2 game with an identical learning-period set has fictitious play property that any fictitious process for the game converges to equilibrium provided that players learn frequently enough.

A similar phenomenon occurs with deterministically trending instruments. The present work shows that such irrelevant deterministic trend instruments may be systematically used to produce asymptotically efficient estimates of a cointegrated system. The approach is convenient in practice, involves only linear instrumental variables estimation, and is a straightforward one step procedure with no loss of degrees of freedom in estimation. Simulations reveal that the procedure works well in practice both in terms of point and interval estimation, having little finite sample bias and less finite sample dispersion than other popular cointegrating regression procedures such as reduced rank VAR regression, fully modified least squares, and dynamic OLS. The procedure is a form of maximum likelihood estimation where the likelihood is constructed for data projected onto the trending instruments. This trend likelihood is related to the notion of the local Whittle likelihood but avoids frequency domain issues. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Phillips, Peter C.

This paper explores the spillover effects of the Medicare Advantage program on the traditional Medicare program and other patients, taking advantage of changes in Medicare Advantage payment policy to isolate exogenous increases in Medicare Advantage enrollment and trace out the effects of greater managed care penetration on hospital utilization and spending throughout the health care system. We find that when more seniors enroll in Medicare managed care, hospital costs decline for all seniors and for commercially insured younger populations. Greater managed care penetration is not associated with fewer hospitalizations, but is associated with lower costs and shorter stays per hospitalization. These spillovers are substantial - offsetting more than 10% of increased payments to Medicare Advantage plans. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This pattern of the data is not captured by the standard specification that model spreads as persistent processes reverting to a time-varying mean determined by two factors: a local factor, driven by fiscal fundamentals and growth, and a global world factor, driven by the market's appetite for risk. This paper argues that a third factor, expectations of exchange rate devaluation, gained traction during the crises. This factor is well captured via a GVAR that models the interdependence among spreads by making each country's spread function of global European spreads. Global spreads capture the exposure of each country's spread to other spreads in the euro area in terms of the time-varying 'distance' between their fiscal fundamentals. This new specification dominates the standard one in modelling the time-varying pattern of co-movements among spreads and the response of euro area spreads to the Greek debt crisis.

J,"Grabisch, M; Rusinowska, A",,,,"Grabisch, Michel; Rusinowska, Agnieszka",,,A model of influence based on aggregation functions,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AUTHORITY DISTRIBUTIONS; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; ORGANIZATIONS,"The paper concerns a dynamic model of influence in which agents make a yes-no decision. Each agent has an initial opinion which he may change during different phases of interaction, due to mutual influence among agents. We investigate a model of influence based on aggregation functions. Each agent modifies his opinion independently of the others, by aggregating the current opinion of all agents. Our framework covers numerous existing models of opinion formation, since we allow for arbitrary aggregation functions. We provide a general analysis of convergence in the aggregation model and find all terminal classes and states. We show that possible terminal classes to which the process of influence may converge are terminal states (the consensus states and nontrivial states), cyclic terminal classes, and unions of Boolean lattices (called regular terminal classes). An agent is influential for another agent if the opinion of the first one matters for the latter. A generalization of influential agent to an irreducible coalition whose opinion matters for an agent is called influential coalition. The graph (hypergraph) of influence is a graphical representation of influential agents (coalitions). Based on properties of the hypergraphs of influence we obtain conditions for the existence of the different kinds of terminal classes. An important family of aggregation functions - the family of symmetric decomposable models - is discussed. Finally, based on the results of the paper, we analyze the manager network of Krackhardt.

Objective health outcomes are observed before and after a new addition to the family. To date, the literature on family size has focused on a quality-quantity trade-off; the more children in a family, the less resources devoted to each child. We present a theoretical framework which highlights that the quantity-quality trade-off may only be relevant in the case of an unplanned sibling. We also suggest that a planned sibling may result in health gains for the other children. We use two waves of data for more than 1800 children from Peru from the Young Lives Project to test our hypothesis. The data relate to the children at 1 and 5years. For health outcomes, height for age and weight for age Z are considered. The results highlight significant negative independent effects on height for age when an unplanned sibling is added to the household. In addition, we find positive sibling effects on height for age when a planned sibling arrives. We find only small planning effects for weight for age. We view our hypothesis as a pathway that can further explain the quantity-quality trade-off.

The focus on the change in health is at the possible expense of other experiences of life once in that health state. We analyse personal preferences to a pairwise choice task involving trade-offs between quality and length of life, where satisfaction levels with life or health are introduced in the description of the health states. We find that a health scenario including low levels of satisfaction increases the likelihood of preferring to die sooner in full health, whereas scenarios including high levels of satisfaction increase the likelihood of preferring to live for longer in poor health. The differences highlight the sensitivity of preferences to what is described in health states and therefore show the importance of on-going discussions about precisely what respondents should be asked to consider in preference elicitation studies.

Methods: We used a cross-sectional survey to ascertain demographic, clinical, and health utility data from patients who had undergone LAGB in Washington State from 2004 to 2010. The EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire was used for health utility estimation. We calculated adjusted EQ-5D questionnaire indices across BMI categories by using a two-part model. We also used logistic regression to examine the relationship between BMI and the likelihood of reporting problems on each of the EQ-5D questionnaire dimension. Results: Data were obtained from 790 subjects. The mean adjusted EQ-5D questionnaire indices for all obese BMI categories were significantly lower than those in the normal weight category. The relationship between BMI and EQ-5D questionnaire indices was nonlinear. Respondents classified as morbidly obese II (BMI > 50 kg/m(2)) had the greatest decrement (-0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.28 to -0.01) in EQ-5D questionnaire indices. The association between EQ-5D questionnaire indices and BMI at the time of the survey was weaker after adjusting for weight loss after LAGB. Respondents with higher BMI were more likely to report having problems in the mobility, usual/activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression dimensions (trend test, P < 0.05), but not for the self-care dimension (trend test, P = 0.08). Conclusions: The EQ-5D questionnaire has a negative and nonlinear relationship with BMI for obese patients who had LAGB. The relationship is confounded by weight loss.

Beneficiaries vary in their demand for care. TM fully accommodates demand but creates a moral hazard inefficiency. MA rations care but disregards some elements of the demand. We describe an efficient assignment of beneficiaries to these two options, and argue that efficiency requires an MA program oriented to serve the large middle part of the distribution of demand: the middle class. Current Medicare policy of a single premium for MA plans cannot achieve efficient sorting. We characterize the demand-based premium policy that can implement the efficient assignment of enrollees to plans. If only a single premium is feasible, the second-best policy involves too many of the low-demand individuals in MA and a too low level of services relative to the first best. We identify approaches to using premium policy to revitalize MA and improve the efficiency of Medicare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

There are large racial disparities in pneumococcal vaccination rates in this population. Here, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical national vaccination intervention program designed to eliminate racial disparities in pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly. Methods: In an exploratory analysis, a Markov decision-analysis model was developed, taking a societal perspective and assuming a 1-year cycle length, 10-year vaccination program duration, and lifetime time horizon. In the base-case analysis, it was conservatively assumed that vaccination program promotion costs were $10 per targeted minority elder per year, regardless of prior vaccination status and resulted in the elderly African American and Hispanic pneumococcal vaccination rate matching the elderly Caucasian vaccination rate (65%) in year 10 of the program. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness of the vaccination program relative to no program was $45,161 per quality-adjusted life-year gained in the base-case analysis. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the likelihood of the vaccination program being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained was 64% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: In a conservative analysis biased against the vaccination program, a national vaccination intervention program to ameliorate racial disparities in pneumococcal vaccination would be cost-effective.","[Michaelidis, Constantinos I.; Zimmerman, Richard K.; Nowalk, Mary Patricia] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Zimmerman, Richard K.; Nowalk, Mary Patricia] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Family Med & Clin Epidemiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Smith, Kenneth J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Sect Decis Sci & Clin Syst Modeling, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Michaelidis, CI (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, 3550 Terrace St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",michaelidis.constant@medstudent.pitt.edu,"Nowalk, Mary Patricia/ACU-4712-2022","Zimmerman, Richard/0000-0001-5941-6092; Smith, Kenneth J/0000-0001-8088-566X",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI076256]; University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Clinical Scientist Training Program,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Clinical Scientist Training Program,This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant no.

We shall call this the Becker proposition (BP). The BP is derived under the assumptions of expected utility theory (EU). However, EU is heavily rejected by the evidence. A range of non-expected utility theories have been proposed to explain the evidence. The two leading alternatives to EU are rank dependent utility (RDU) and cumulative prospect theory (CP). The main contributions of this paper are: (1) we formalize the BP in a more satisfactory manner; (2) we show that the BP holds under RDU and CP; and (3) we give a formal behavioral approach to crime and punishment that could have applicability to a wide range of problems in the economics of crime.

The proposed methods are robust in the sense that they can handle target distributions that exhibit non-elliptical shapes such as multimodality and skewness. The basic method makes use of sequences of importance weighted Expectation Maximization steps in order to efficiently construct a mixture of Student-t densities that approximates accurately the target distribution - typically a posterior distribution, of which we only require a kernel - in the sense that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between target and mixture is minimized. We label this approach Mixture of t by Importance Sampling weighted Expectation Maximization (MitISEM). The constructed mixture is used as a candidate density for quick and reliable application of either Importance Sampling (IS) or the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) method. We also introduce three extensions of the basic MitISEM approach. First, we propose a method for applying MitISEM in a sequential manner, so that the candidate distribution for posterior simulation is cleverly updated when new data become available. Our results show that the computational effort reduces enormously, while the quality of the approximation remains almost unchanged. This sequential approach can be combined with a tempering approach, which facilitates the simulation from densities with multiple modes that are far apart. Second, we introduce a permutation-augmented MitISEM approach. This is useful for importance or Metropolis-Hastings sampling from posterior distributions in mixture models without the requirement of imposing identification restrictions on the model's mixture regimes' parameters. Third, we propose a partial MitISEM approach, which aims at approximating the joint distribution by estimating a product of marginal and conditional distributions. This division can substantially reduce the dimension of the approximation problem, which facilitates the application of adaptive importance sampling for posterior simulation in more complex models with larger numbers of parameters. Our results indicate that the proposed methods can substantially reduce the computational burden in econometric models like DCC or mixture GARCH models and a mixture instrumental variables model.

Option and spot market information on the latent variance process is captured by using dual 'model-free' variance measures to define a bivariate observation equation in the state space model. The premium for variance diffusive risk is defined as linear in the latent variance (in the usual fashion) whilst the premium for variance jump risk is specified as a conditionally deterministic dynamic process, driven by a function of past measurements. The inferential approach adopted is Bayesian, implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that caters for the multiple sources of non-linearity in the model and for the bivariate measure. The method is applied to spot and option price data on the S&P500 index from 1999 to 2008, with conclusions drawn about investors' required compensation for variance risk during the recent financial turmoil. The accuracy of the probabilistic forecasts of the observable variance measures is demonstrated, and compared with that of forecasts yielded by alternative methods. To illustrate the benefits of the approach, it is used to produce forecasts of prices of derivatives on volatility itself. In addition, the posterior distribution is augmented by information on daily returns to produce value at risk predictions. Linking the variance risk premia to the risk aversion parameter in a representative agent model, probabilistic forecasts of (approximate) relative risk aversion are also produced.

This paper revisits the original justification of the Panel and the critiques that appeared in the literature at the time. It then analyzes how productivity costs would be viewed from a costbenefit analysis perspective to identify their welfare implications and then translates these implications into what they mean for how to express productivity costs in a costutility analysis. Next, three consistency issues are identified: (i) consistency between the welfare implications and the health status questionnaires used to construct the QALYs; (ii) consistency between the productivity costs from morbidity and mortality; and (iii) consistency between the measurement of productivity costs and the societal perspective. Finally, after reviewing the productivity costs policies of other countries, the paper makes a modest proposal for a new US policy.

Little is known, however, about the impact of minimally invasive THR on resource use and length of stay. This study analyzed the effect of minimally invasive surgery on hospital costs and length of stay in German hospitals compared with conventional treatment in THR. Methods: We used patient-level administrative hospital data from three German hospitals participating in the national cost data study. We conducted a propensity score matching to account for baseline differences between minimally invasively and conventionally treated patients. Subsequently, we estimated the treatment effect on costs and length of stay by conducting group comparisons, via paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and regression analyses. Results: The three hospitals provided data from 2886 THR patients. The propensity score matching led to 812 matched pairs. Length of stay was significantly higher for conventionally treated patients (11.49 days vs. 10.90 days; P < 0.05), but total costs did not differ significantly ((sic)6018 vs. (sic)5986; P = 0.67). We found a difference in the allocation of costs, with significantly higher implant costs for minimally invasively treated patients ((sic)1514 vs. (sic)1375; P < 0.001) in contrast to significantly higher staff and overhead costs for conventionally treated patients. Conclusions: Minimally invasive surgery was compared with conventional THR and was found to be associated with a reduced length of stay. Total hospital costs, however, did not differ between the two treatment groups, because of higher implant costs for minimally invasively treated patients.","[Roettger, Julia; Scheller-Kreinsen, David; Busse, Reinhard] Berlin Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Care Management, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Röttger, J (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Care Management, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",Julia.Roettger@tu-berlin.de,,,European Commission [223300],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),Source of financial support: The data collection for this analysis was funded through the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission under Grant Agreement Number 223300.,,48,11,11,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,999,1004,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.008,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244800.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300002,0

These estimators yield sampling distributions of the structural parameters of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models by minimizing the distance between sample and theoretical impulse responses. First, we propose an information criterion to select only the responses that produce consistent estimates of the true but unknown structural parameters: the Valid Impulse Response Selection Criterion (VIRSC). The criterion is especially useful for mis-specified models. Second, we propose a criterion to select the impulse responses that are most informative about DSGE model parameters: the Relevant Impulse Response Selection Criterion (RIRSC). These criteria can be used in combination to select the subset of valid impulse response functions with minimal dimension that yields asymptotically efficient estimators. The criteria are general enough to apply to impulse responses estimated by VARs, local projections, and simulation methods. We show that the use of our criteria significantly affects estimates and inference about key parameters of two well-known new Keynesian DSGE models. Monte Carlo evidence indicates that the criteria yield gains in terms of finite sample bias as well as offering tests statistics whose behavior is better approximated by the first order asymptotic theory. Thus, our criteria improve existing methods used to implement IRFMEs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This makes the payoffs and therefore potential equilibrium strategies dependent on the history of play. A subgame perfect equilibrium is constructed, in which the strategies depend on the history of play through the current reference points. It is shown that this equilibrium is unique under some assumptions that it shares with the equilibrium in the classical model: immediate acceptance of equilibrium offers, indifference between acceptance and rejection of such offers, and strategies depending only on the current reference points. It is also shown that in this equilibrium loss aversion is a disadvantage. Moreover, a relation with asymmetric Nash bargaining is established, where a player's bargaining power is negatively related to own loss aversion and positively to the opponent's loss aversion.

To do so, information on prime aged individuals living in Amsterdam in 1994 is used. Dutch data offer a clear advantage in estimating the health impacts of cannabis use because the legal status of cannabis in the Netherlands ensures that estimates are free from confounding with the physical and psychological effects of engaging in a criminal activity. Accounting for selection into cannabis use and shared frailties in mental and physical health, the results suggest that cannabis use reduces the mental wellbeing of men and women and the physical wellbeing of men. Although statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect of using cannabis on mental and physical health is found to be small. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our results are based on the estimation of a dynamic game of network competition using data from the Airline Origin and Destination Survey with information on quantities, prices, and entry and exit decisions for every airline company in the routes between the 55 largest US cities. As methodological contributions of the paper, we propose and apply a method to reduce the dimension of the state space in dynamic games, and a procedure to deal with the problem of multiple equilibria when implementing counterfactual experiments. Our empirical results show that the most important factor to explain the adoption of hub-and-spoke networks is that the sunk cost of entry in a route declines importantly with the number of cities that the airline connects from the origin and destination airports of the route. For some carriers, the entry deterrence motive is the second most important factor to explain hub-and-spoke networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Data from a cross-sectional, multicountry study were used. Individuals with episodic and chronic migraine were randomly assigned to training or validation samples. Spearman's correlation coefficients between paired EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire utility values and both Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) scores and Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQ) domain scores (role restrictive, role preventive, and emotional function) were examined. Regression models were constructed to estimate EQ-5D questionnaire utility values from the HIT-6 score or the MSQ domain scores. Preferred algorithms were confirmed in the validation samples. Results: In episodic migraine, the preferred HIT-6 and MSQ algorithms explained 22% and 25% of the variance (R-2) in the training samples, respectively, and had similar prediction errors (root mean square errors of 0.30). In chronic migraine, the preferred HIT-6 and MSQ algorithms explained 36% and 45% of the variance in the training samples, respectively, and had similar prediction errors (root mean square errors 0.31 and 0.29). In episodic and chronic migraine, no statistically significant differences were observed between the mean observed and the mean estimated EQ-5D questionnaire utility values for the preferred HIT-6 and MSQ algorithms in the validation samples. Conclusions: The relationship between the EQ-5D questionnaire and the HIT-6 or the MSQ is adequate to use regression equations to estimate EQ-5D questionnaire utility values. The preferred HIT-6 and MSQ algorithms will be useful in estimating health-state utilities in migraine trials in which no preference-based measure is present.","[Gillard, Patrick J.; Varon, Sepideh F.; Liu, Lei] Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Global Hlth Outcomes Strategy & Res, Irvine, CA 92612 USA; [Devine, Beth; Sullivan, Sean D.] Univ Washington, Sch Pharm, Sch Med, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",AbbVie; Allergan; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Gillard, PJ (通讯作者)，Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Global Hlth Outcomes Strategy & Res, 2525 Dupont Dr,T2-6A, Irvine, CA 92612 USA.",gillard_patrick@allergan.com,"Devine, Beth/ITU-0067-2023",,"Allergan, Inc.","Allergan, Inc.(AbbVieAllergan)","There was no financial support given for this study.

The trial met its primary end point at 24 weeks, but a subsequent trial did not show a sustained effect of denufosol at 48 weeks. By using the 48-week data, we characterized resource use, direct medical costs, indirect costs, and utility estimates. Methods: Data on medications, outpatient and emergency visits, hospital admissions, tests, procedures, and home nursing were captured on study case report forms. Sources for unit costs included the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and the Red Book. Health utilities were derived from the Health Utilities Index Mark 2/3. We used multivariable regression to evaluate the impact of baseline covariates on costs. Results: Characteristics of the 352 participants at enrollment included mean age of 14.6 years, history of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in 45.2%, use of dornase alfa in 77.0%, and long-term use of inhaled antibiotics in 37.2%. Over 48 weeks, 22.4% of participants were hospitalized and, on average, participants missed 7.4 days of school or work. Mean total costs (excluding denufosol) were $39,673 (SD $26,842), of which 85% were attributable to medications. Female sex and P. aeruginosa colonization were independently associated with higher costs. Conclusions: Prospective economic data collection alongside a clinical trial allows for robust estimates of cost of illness. The mean annual cost of care for patients with cystic fibrosis with mild impairment in lung function exceeds $ 43,000 and is driven by medication costs.","[Grussemeyer, Chelsea A.; Friedman, Joelle Y.; Dinan, Michaela A.; Lin, Li; Schulman, Kevin A.; Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC 27715 USA; [DeWitt, Esi Morgan] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Div Rheumatol, Cincinnati, OH USA; [DeWitt, Esi Morgan] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, James M Anderson Ctr Hlth Syst Excellence, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Schulman, Kevin A.; Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27715 USA",Duke University; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Duke University,"Reed, SD (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Clin Res Inst, POB 17969, Durham, NC 27715 USA.",shelby.reed@duke.edu,,,Inspire Pharmaceuticals; Duke University,Inspire Pharmaceuticals; Duke University,This work was supported by a research agreement between Inspire Pharmaceuticals and Duke University.,,32,34,36,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2012,15,2.0,,,,,277,283,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.027,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,914DZ,22433759.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301930600009,0

By introducing alternating offers and strategic delay into the nonlinear pricing model, we relax this assumption and analyze an infinite-horizon contract bargaining game. We attain either the sequential separating equilibrium or the simultaneous separating equilibrium, depending on the parameter values. We prove the existence and the uniqueness of the equilibrium, and claim that multidimensionality and strategic delay can help resolve the multiple equilibria problem of bargaining theory. When the time between offers approaches zero, either quantity distortion or delay persists. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the apparent association between oral antidiabetic therapy and mortality by simulating the effects of restrictive drug coverage policies. Methods: Population-based cohort study of 12,272 new patients using oral antidiabetic agents were identified using the administrative databases of Saskatchewan Health, 1991 to 1996. We randomly misclassified 0% [base case], 10%, 25%, and 50% of known patients taking metformin according to either overt drug exposure (e. g., metformin users switched to nonusers) or time of metformin initiation (e.g., delayed capture of exposure); thereby simulating the use of a non-formulary or  special authorization policy, respectively. We also simulated an age-dependent coverage policy, mimicking a policy restricted to seniors. Results: Metformin use was associated with lower mortality compared with sulfonylurea use in the base case (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-0.99) and the nonformulary simulations. The special authorization simulations demonstrated, however, an increasing relative mortality hazard of metformin versus sulfonylurea exposure: aHR 0.96, 95% CI 0.96-0.97 and aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.311.37, for 10% and 50% delays in coverage capture respectively when 50% of metformin users were misclassified. Age-dependent drug coverage had a variable impact on mortality risk compared with the base-case cohort; however, a new-user simulation with a 1-year washout revealed consistent results to the base-case analysis. Conclusion: Restrictive drug coverage policies may result in substantial drug exposure misclassification, potentially severely biasing the results of drug-outcome relationships using administrative databases.","[Eurich, Dean T.] Univ Alberta, Li Ka Shing Ctr Hlth Res Innovat 2 040, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada; [Gamble, John-Michael; McAlister, Finlay A.; Johnson, Jeffrey A.; Eurich, Dean T.] Univ Alberta, ACHORD, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada; [McAlister, Finlay A.] Mazankowski Alberta Heart Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [McAlister, Finlay A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Eurich, DT (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Li Ka Shing Ctr Hlth Res Innovat 2 040, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.",deurich@ualberta.ca,"; McAlister, Finlay/C-4151-2013","Gamble, John-Michael/0000-0001-6891-8721; McAlister, Finlay/0000-0001-7435-3341; Johnson, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8290-2857","Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions (AIHS); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [OTG-88588]; CIHR Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes (INMD)","Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions (AIHS); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); CIHR Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes (INMD)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR))","Mr. Gamble receives salary support through a full-time Health Research Studentship from Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions (AIHS) and a Canada Graduate Scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).

This stable set contains location profiles that reflect minimum differentiation as well as those profiles that reflect local monopoly.

However, very little is known about the timing of generic adoption and diffusion. No prior study has empirically examined the differential launch times of generics across a comprehensive set of markets, or more specifically the delays in country specific adoption of generics relative to the first country of (generic) adoption. Drawing on data containing significant country and product variation across a lengthy time period (1999-2008), we use duration analysis to examine relative delays, across countries, in the adoption of generic drugs. Our results suggest that price regulation has a significant effect on reducing the time to launch of generics, with faster adoption in higher priced markets. The latter result is dependent on the degree of competition and the expected market size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A post hoc analysis of the phase 11 Solifenacin and Tamsulosin in Males with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Associated with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia trial (NCT00510406), a 12-week clinical trial in men with LUTS associated with BPH, assessed the measurement properties of six PPIUS-derived scores: mean score; maximum urgency score; total urgency and frequency score (TUFS; average sum of urgency scores over 3 days); and numbers of urgency episodes, urgency episodes of grade 3 or 4, and urgency incontinence episodes. Test retest reliability, presence of floor/ceiling effects, responsiveness to change, known-group validity, and concurrent validity were assessed for each score. Results: A total of 901 patients had at least one valid PPIUS assessment after baseline. TUFS demonstrated good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8), discriminated between groups defined based on International Prostate Symptom Score storage score severity (known-groups validity), had high concurrent validity, and had high responsiveness to change (Guyatt's responsiveness statistic 0.88), with an absence of floor or ceiling effects. The psychometric properties of other PPIUS-derived scores were not as consistently robust and showed either low-to-moderate responsiveness, presence of a floor or ceiling effect, or low-to-moderate test-retest reliability. Conclusions: This study shows that the PPIUS is reliable and valid in patients with LUTS associated with BPH. TUFS provided the best combination of psychometric properties of the six scores derived from the PPIUS and appeared to be an appropriate measure of urgency and frequency.","[Mathias, Susan D.; Crosby, Ross D.] Hlth Outcomes Solut, Winter Pk, FL 32790 USA; [Crosby, Ross D.] Neuropsychiat Res Inst, Fargo, ND USA; [Crosby, Ross D.] Univ N Dakota, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA; [Nazir, Jameel; Odeyemi, Isaac A.] Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd, Chertsey, Surrey, England; [Klaver, Monique; Drogendijk, Ted; Hakimi, Zalmai] Astellas Pharrna Global Dev, Leiden, Netherlands",Neuropsychiatric Research Institute; University of North Dakota Grand Forks; Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Mathias, SD (通讯作者)，Hlth Outcomes Solut, POB 2343, Winter Pk, FL 32790 USA.",smathias@healthoutcomessolutions.com,"Hakimi, Zalmai/AAZ-5620-2021","Crosby, Ross/0000-0001-9131-1629",Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.,Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.(Astellas Pharmaceuticals),Funding for this study was provided in full by Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.,,34,7,7,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2014,17,8.0,,,,,823,829,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.09.002,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AX4RC,25498777.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346918100008,0

This study demonstrates an alternative approach to lengthening clinical trials to assess these long-term outcomes. Objective: To use observational quasi-experimental methods using instrumental variables (lVs) to compare the effect of two hypoglycemic medications, sulfonylureas (SUs) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs), on long-term outcomes. Methods: This study used administrative data from the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare from 2000 to 2010. The study population included US veterans dually enrolled in Medicare who received a prescription for metformin and then initiated SUs or TZDs. Patients could either continue on or discontinue metformin after the initiation of the second agent. Treatment was defined as starting either a SD or a TZD. Local variations in SD prescribing rates were used as instruments in IV models to control for selection bias. Survival models predicted all cause mortality, ambulatory care sensitive condition hospitalizations, and stroke or heart attack (acute myocardial infarction). Results: Starting on SUs compared to TZDs significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing mortality and ACSC hospitalization. The estimated hazard ratio for the effect of starting on SUs compared to TZDs was 1.50 (95% confidence interval [CIJ 1.09-2.09) for all-cause mortality, 1.68 (95% Cl 1.31-2.15) for ambulatory care sensitive condition hospitalization, and 1.15 (95% CI 0.80-1.66) for acute myocardial infarction or stroke. Conclusions: Our findings suggest increased risk of major adverse events associated with SUs as a second-line agent Quasi-experimental IV methods may be an important alternative to lengthening clinical trials to assess long-term outcomes.","[Prentice, Julia C.; Conlin, Paul R.; Pizer, Steven D.] VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Boston, MA 02130 USA; [Prentice, Julia C.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Conlin, Paul R.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gellad, Walid F.] VA Pittsburgh Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Gellad, Walid F.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Edelman, David] Durham VA Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Edelman, David] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Durham, NC USA; [Lee, Todd A.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL USA; [Pizer, Steven D.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Harvard University; VA Boston Healthcare System; Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Durham VA Medical Center; Duke University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Northeastern University,"Prentice, JC (通讯作者)，VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Hlth Care Financing & Econ, 150 South Huntington Ave 152H, Boston, MA 02130 USA.",jprentic@bu.edu,,"Edelman, David/0000-0001-7112-6151; Pizer, Steven/0000-0003-4908-5976; Lee, Todd/0000-0003-3619-5367",Health Services Research and Development Service of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs [IIR 10-136]; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [R01 HS019708]; National Institute of Health [K24 DK63214],Health Services Research and Development Service of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs(US Department of Veterans Affairs); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"Health Services Research and Development Service of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (grant no.
