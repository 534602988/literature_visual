Therefore, tools and approaches that provide a full future vision of any organization should be a strategic priority for economic development. In this line, cities are centers of knowledge and sources of growth and innovation and integrated urban development policies are necessary. These policies support communication networks and optimize location structures as strategies that provide opportunities for social and democratic participation for the citizens. This paper proposes a theoretical model to measure and evaluate the cities intellectual capital that allows determine what we must take into account to make cities a source of wealth, prosperity, welfare and future growth. Furthermore, local intellectual capital provides a long run vision. Thus, in this paper we develop and explain how to implement a model to estimate intellectual capital in cities. In this sense, our proposal is to provide a model for measuring and managing intellectual capital using socio-economic indicators for cities. These indicators offer a long term picture supported by a comprehensive strategy for those who occupy the local space, infrastructure for implementation and management of the environment for its development.","[Alfaro Navarro, Jose Luis; Lopez Ruiz, Victor Raul; Nevado Pena, Domingo] Univ Castilla La Mancha, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Navarro, JLA (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",JoseLuis.Alfaro@uclm.es,"Lopez Ruiz, Victor Raul/Q-4716-2017","Lopez Ruiz, Victor Raul/0000-0002-2850-1662",,,,,46,8,8,0,29,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2013,15.0,34,,,,,455,468,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,156XV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319858100012,0

This anomaly has been found to be particularly pronounced in Turkey. We therefore examine whether mutual fund managers investing in Turkish stocks are able to benefit from the Ramadan effect. We find that risk-adjusted performance of domestic institutional funds, hybrid funds and foreign Turkish equity funds is substantially higher during Ramadan compared to the rest of the year. By contrast, domestic index funds fail to deliver higher abnormal returns as they are adversely affected by increased money inflows during Ramadan. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We show that undertaking an open market repurchase results in a significant reduction in the size of the shareholder base. Consequently, we find that firms with small shareholder bases are less likely to undertake a repurchase (reduce the shareholder base even further) and are more likely to pay special dividends.","[Bodnaruk, Andriy] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Oestberg, Per] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Notre Dame; University of Zurich,"Bodnaruk, A (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Finance, 238 Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",abodnaru@nd.edu; per.oestberg@bf.uzh.ch,,,,,,,61,27,29,5,38,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

With this legislation, a large number of the potential bank merger are exempted from obtaining the permission from the Turkish Competition Authority. Turkish Competition Authority and international organizations such as European Commission and OECD object strongly to this exemption. However, no impact analysis on the banking industry exemption has been worked so far neither by regulatory bodies nor academicians. The main motivation of this study is to carry out an impact analysis of the current legislation in order to contribute to the discussions on preserving or abolishing the banking industry exemption. For this aim, we estimate a discrete choice model of demand for loan services and run a series of simulations for hypothetical bank mergers. Our results witness that welfare decreasing effects of the bank mergers covered by the exemption are very low and can be tolerated.","[Celen, Aydin; Kalkan, Ekrem] Univ Mahallesi, Turkish Competit Author, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources - Turkey; Ministry of Customs & Trade - Turkey; Gaziantep University,"Çelen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mahallesi, Turkish Competit Author, 1597 Cadde 9, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",acelen@rekabet.gov.tr; ekalkan@rekabet.gov.tr,"Çelen, Aydın/AAM-7709-2020",,,,,,27,2,2,0,8,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

It finds that better corporate governance benefit firms through greater access to financing, lower cost of capital, better performance, and more favorable treatment of all stakeholders. Numerous studies show these channels to operate at the level of firms, sectors and countries with causality increasingly often clearly identified. Evidence also shows that voluntary and market corporate governance mechanisms have less effect when a country's governance system is weak. Importantly, how corporate governance regimes change over time and how this impacts firms are receiving more attention recently. Less evidence is available on the direct links between corporate governance and social and environmental performance. The paper concludes by identifying issues requiring further study, including the special corporate governance issues of banks, and family-owned and state-owned firms, and the nature and determinants of public and private enforcement.

The tax savings represent a 15-24% decrease in the state income tax burden and translate to an increase in net income of 1.04-1.47%.

The outcomes of migration are highly diverging: while for poorer fishers, migration is a way of coping with shocks, better resourced fishers can use it for asset accumulation. The importance of migration for their livelihoods and emerging networks across space generate forms of translocal households that coordinate their activities over long distances.","[Islam, Mohammad Mahmudul] Univ Bremen, Bremen Int Grad Sch Marine Sci GLOMAR, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Islam, Mohammad Mahmudul; Herbeck, Johannes] Univ Bremen, Artec Res Ctr Sustainabil Studies, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen; University of Bremen,"Islam, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Bremen Int Grad Sch Marine Sci GLOMAR, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",m.islam@uni-bremen.de,"Islam, M.

Our results suggest that post-IPO cash holdings as well as marginal value of cash reserves are higher under a founder CEO governance regime relative to non-founder CEOs. Concentrating board power in the hands of founder CEOs however, reduces their ability to maintain higher post-IPO cash reserves. Our results also suggest that product market competition influences both the level and marginal value of cash reserves in the hands of founder CEOs. Further, we find that stronger internal governance reduces the tendency of IPO firms to deploy excess cash reserves to fund internal investments in excess of industry rivals.

Moreover, when the fit is included in the analysis, the magnitude of the production-based factors becomes consistently smaller and the fit drives out the significance of the production-based factors.

Using the data from the U.S. equity funds, we find that funds adopting an MDP significantly reduce their discounts at the announcements of the policy, but funds adopting an SRP do not. We also find that funds with an MDP earn higher NAV (net asset value) returns than the market during one or three years after the adoption, whereas funds with an SRP do not. After controlling for other determinants, we document that the funds with an MDP trade at lower discounts than other funds without any payout policy, while the funds with an SRP trade at higher discounts. These findings are broadly consistent with the signaling argument. However, the discount reductions for MOP funds are not explained by changes in agency costs measured by fund size and expense ratios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, the majority of the U.S. states benefit from formula allocation, thus providing a plausible explanation for the status quo bias in budgetary formulas.","[Larcinese, Valentino] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, London, England; [Larcinese, Valentino] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, STICERD, London, England; [Rizzo, Leonzio] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ, Ferrara, Italy; [Testa, Cecilia] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Ferrara; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Larcinese, V (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, London, England.;Larcinese, V (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, STICERD, London, England.",v.larcinese@lse.ac.uk; leonio.rizzo@unife.it; cecilia.testa@rhul.ac.uk,,"Rizzo, Leonzio/0000-0001-8099-8699",,,,,21,1,5,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Toward this end, and based on a recent theoretical model, the current study attempted to predict OCB by organizational justice, work motivation, and self-efficacy. A research questionnaire measuring the three predictors was administered to 151 employees, and a measure of their OCB was provided by their supervisors. Whereas OCBs were found to be positively correlated with the three predictors, a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that only organizational justice and work motivation were significant predictors of OCBs. The study emphasizes the importance of using an interactionist perspective integrating endogenous and exogenous forces in studying the antecedents of OCBs. OCBs may be closely related to task performance and may be predicted by motivation related variables. Organizations may facilitate OCBs by improving organizational justice and raising work motivation among employees.","[Oren, Lior] Ariel Univ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, Ariel, Israel; [Tziner, Aharon; Nahshon, Yulia; Sharoni, Gil] Netanya Acad Coll, Sch Business Adm & Behav Sci, Netanya, Israel",Ariel University,"Oren, L (通讯作者)，Ariel Univ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, Ariel, Israel.",orenl@ariel.ac.il; atziner@netanya.ac.il,,,,,,,60,11,15,0,39,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2013,15.0,34,,,,,505,516,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,156XV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319858100015,0

However, different responses among road users to certain policies are inevitable. This paper presents a study evaluating the possible consequences of cordon and parking pricing on road users with different trip purposes, i.e., workers and non-workers. Different models have been developed and calibrated with data from the central business district of Mashhad, Iran, using revealed and stated preference methods. The analysis of the interviewee responses to the hypothetical situations shows that workers comprise the dominant proportion using each mode of travel to the Mashhad CBD. The commuters were provided with alternative choices, and their preferences were examined using multinomial logit. The results show that the cost-based policy such as parking and cordon pricing is good to reduce congestion as it affects workers, but the impact is more evident for non-workers travelling to the CBD. Furthermore, the model suggests that workers are more likely to shift mode in response to changes in travel time. The model was also developed to obtain different willingness-to-pay measures, which indicate that workers have a greater willingness to pay for parking and cordon pricing than non-workers.

The results show that exclusivity of the relationship can mitigate the firm credit rationing. We also verify the influence of lending organizational structure during crisis. A new measure of distance in lending technologies has been introduced: the hierarchical distance calculated as the distance between the branch that originates the loan and the location of the hierarchical level responsible for financing decision.

However, few studies have examined the validity of proxy reports as an alternative to self-reported data. In addition, despite research that has been conducted in a different context, little is known to date about the impact of different factors on school travel behaviour in a sectarian divided society. This research examines these issues using 1624 questionnaires collected from four independent samples (e.g. primary pupils, parent of primary pupils, secondary pupils, and parent of secondary pupils) across Northern Ireland. An independent sample t test was conducted to identify the differences in data reporting between pupils and parents for different age groups using the reported number of trips for different modes as dependent variables. Multivariate multiple regression analyses were conducted to then identify the impacts of different factors (e.g. gender, rural-urban context, multiple deprivations, and school management type, net residential density, land use diversity, intersection density) on mode choice behaviour in this context. Results show that proxy report is a valid alternative to self-reported data, but only for primary pupils. Land use diversity and rural-urban context were found to be the most important factors in influencing mode choice behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The study is composed of two stages. Final results, obtained from questionnaire data, reveal that categorically involved consumers engage in more personal risk reduction strategies, usually at the point of sale, and become more loyal consumers. It is also discussed that psychological and social risk types are the ones which consumers feel a greater pressure to decrease the perceived risk, and that different risk types necessitate different risk reduction strategies. It is concluded that this study might contribute to the existing literature on the grounds that it brings different constructs together in the same framework; investigate the effects of categorical involvement; and provide important solutions to marketing managers regarding risk reduction strategies for different risk types.","TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Isletme Bolumu, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University,"Kasnakoglu, BT (通讯作者)，TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Isletme Bolumu, Sogutozu Caddesi 43, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey.",btari@etu.edu.tr,,,,,,,60,0,0,1,17,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

In this study we use information on random assignment to a unique intervention to identify the impact of changes in the size of alternative social network measures on subsequent employment at both the individual and community levels. Our results indicate that being assigned to the treatment protocol significantly increased the size of social networks, particularly weak ties. Nevertheless, these increases do not translate into improved employment outcomes 18 months following study completion. We do not find any evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity based on the initial size of one's social network; rather those whose strong ties increased at a higher rate during the experiment were significantly less likely to hold a job following the experiment. We find that many of these results also hold at the community level among those who did not directly participate in the intervention. In summary, our results suggest that policies can successfully influence the ysize of an individual's social network, but that these increases have a limited impact on long-run labour market outcomes, with the notable exception of changes in the composition of individuals who hold jobs.","[Khan, Adnan Q.] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Lehrer, Steven F.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Queens University - Canada; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Khan, AQ (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,,,,,40,2,3,0,12,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We present a novel analysis of club bidding where the club creates value by aggregating, at least partially, bidders' values. We show that club formation can lead to higher acquisition prices when the number of bidders is exogenously fixed and large. However, when entry costs require bidders to optimize their participation decisions, club formation acts as an endogenous limit on competition and reduces the target's premium. In contrast, social efficiency with club bidding is always higher. Our findings can reconcile the contradictory evidence on club bidding. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Findings demonstrate how companies initially backed by domestic venture capital investors exhibit higher growth in the short term compared to companies backed by cross-border investors. In the medium term, companies initially backed by cross-border venture capital investors exhibit higher growth compared to companies backed by domestic investors. Finally, companies that are initially funded by a syndicate comprising both domestic and cross-border venture capital investors exhibit the highest growth.

We find evidence of an intrinsic bubble in the market pre-2000, implying that overreaction to changes in rents contributed to the overvaluation of real estate prices.

We are particularly interested in whether the behavior of risk takers, such as risky recreationists or smokers, is best explained by a risk-tolerant utility function or if immunity to possibility bias arising from overweighting of low probabilities is a more important motivator of the choice to engage in risky activities. We find that amateur auto racers are more rational than either students or other risky recreationists because they are less likely to overemphasize low-probability events.

If the opera repertory has hardened over time, innovation has not stalled, but become of a less risky kind, shifting to reinterpretation of works by way of new conductors and productions, and trying to reconcile pressures toward creativity and stability.

In order to identify and incorporate procedures for dealing with heterogeneous attribute processing strategies, we ask respondents follow-up questions regarding their reasons for ignoring attributes. Based on these statements, we conclude that the standard way of assigning a zero impact of ignored attributes on the likelihood is inappropriate. We find that some respondents act in accordance with the passive bounded rationality assumption since they ignore an attribute simply because it does not affect their utility. Excluding these genuine zero preferences, as the standard approach essentially does, might bias results. Other respondents claim to have ignored attributes to simplify choices. However, we find that these respondents have actually not completely ignored attributes. We argue along the rationally adaptive behavioural model that valid preference information may indeed be elicited in these cases, and we illustrate how recoding of non-attendance statements conditional on stated reasons may be a more appropriate solution than the current standard way of taking stated non-attendance into account.","[Alemu, Mohammed Hussen] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Morkbak, Morten Raun] Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, COHERE, Odense, Denmark; [Olsen, Soren Boye; Jensen, Carsten Lynge] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",Aarhus University; University of Southern Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Olsen, SB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",moha@dmu.dk; mrm@sam.sdu.dk; sobo@foi.ku.dk; clj@foi.ku.dk,"Alemu, Mohammed Hussen/O-6772-2017; Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014; Alemu, Mohammed Hussen/E-8028-2015; Jensen, Carsten Lynge/E-4601-2015","Alemu, Mohammed Hussen/0000-0002-0404-0232; Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749; Jensen, Carsten Lynge/0000-0002-9609-4982",,,,,62,101,110,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The empirical analysis confirms that the static and dynamic deviations of the GPF's SAA from the market equity portfolio are consistent with the theoretical predictions.","[Bertoni, Fabio] EMLYON Business Sch, F-69134 Ecully, France; [Lugo, Stefano] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",emlyon business school; Utrecht University,"Bertoni, F (通讯作者)，EMLYON Business Sch, Dept Econ Finance & Control, 23 Ave Guy Collongue, F-69134 Ecully, France.",bertoni@em-lyon.com,"Bertoni, Fabio/E-2087-2013","Bertoni, Fabio/0000-0003-1478-673X; Lugo, Stefano/0000-0003-1736-0232",,,,,35,8,8,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The global crisis that began in 2007 has further accelerated the process of cooperation. The Multilateralization of the Chiang Mai Initiative in May 2010 became the key element in establishing an Asian Monetary Fund. This strengthening of institutional integration, coupled with an increased economic interdependence, raises issues regarding the possible creation of a de facto currency bloc in the region. The aim of this paper is to explore this hypothesis using nonstationary panel data. The tools of convergence are translated to the exchange rates and we test, after having defined it, the hypothesis of a currency bloc using the three generations of panel unit root tests. Our results show, firstly, a decoupling of East Asian currencies vis-a-vis the dollar and, secondly, the emergence of a convergence towards regional targets.","[Figuiere, Catherine; Guillaumin, Cyriac] Univ Grenoble, CREG, Grenoble, France; [Guilhot, Laetitia] IAE Lyon, CREG, F-69355 Lyon 08, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Guilhot, L (通讯作者)，IAE Lyon, CREG, 6 Cours Albert Thomas,BP 8242, F-69355 Lyon 08, France.",catherine.figuiere@upmf-grenoble.fr; laetitia.guilhot@univ-lyon3.fr; cyriac.guillaumin@upmf-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,91,2,2,0,16,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

However, for financially distressed sponsors and sponsors that freeze, terminate, or convert defined benefit to defined contribution plans, the risk-shifting incentive (moral hazard) dominates. Pension fund risk-taking is also affected by labor unionization and sponsor incentives to maximize tax benefits, restore financial slack, and justify the accounting choices of pension assumptions. Sponsors shift toward an aggressive risk strategy when their pension plans emerge from underfunding, bankruptcy risk is reduced, or marginal tax rate decreases. Overall, we show that corporate sponsors adopt a dynamic risk-taking strategy in their pension fund investments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By best practice, we understand specific marketing tools and strategies built upon real needs and heterogeneous consumer preferences, addressed directly in a relevant way, aiming at clients' long-term retention. We should also take into consideration the highly competitive market, with rapid changes in purchase and consumption behavior, while the ever-increasing degree of technology changes fundamentally not only the speed, but also the information content. Since past years we can talk about consumer behavior analysis based on multiple criteria, including the emotional or moral components, consumers' expectations, and life style, as understanding such variables is the main pillar of relationship marketing. The main objectives rely upon building long-term relations, client retention, and loyalty. As part of marketing efforts, the communication component has an increasingly important role, approaching niches with tailored messages, inviting clients to open dialogue. Economic changes, extensive use of technology, migration towards online and optimization of communication channels opened the doors for digital era, when relationship marketing and client relationship management (CRM) represent not a merely working premise, but an essential ground.

We estimate the relationship between child labor and various measures of market imperfections in Madagascar, controlling for a large set of village characteristics and district fixed effects. On average, market imperfections increase child labor but the effects are heterogenous by land ownership (and consistent with the model). An improvement of markets is associated to a decrease in child labor, which is suggestive of new policies to fight against child labor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We predict and find that the profitability of insider trading is significantly greater in firms disclosing material weaknesses in internal control relative to firms with effective control. The positive association is present in the years leading up to the disclosure of material weaknesses, but disappears after remediation of the internal control problems. We find insider trading profitability is even greater when insiders are more likely to act in their own self-interest as indicated by auditors' weak tone at the top adverse internal control opinions and this incremental profitability is driven by insider selling. Our research identifies a new setting where shareholders are most at risk for wealth transfers via insider trading and highlights market consequences of weak tone at the top. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Most private certification schemes address animal welfare in their requirements but this does not necessarily result in higher levels of farm animal welfare if they only overlap with existing national standards. The on-farm evaluations showed that most farms already voluntarily over-comply with some of the standards imposed by public legislation or private labels. Thus, proposals to simply increase standards to improve farm animal welfare without considering the already implemented on-farm animal welfare level have to be evaluated with caution.","[Annen, Dominic Norbert; Wieck, Christine; Kempen, Markus] Univ Bonn, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Wieck, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Lebensmittel & Ressourcenokon, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",Christine.Wieck@ilr.uni-bonn.de,,"Wieck, Christine/0000-0002-5791-6111",EU 6th Framework Programme project Cross Compliance Assessment Tools (CCAT) [44423-CCAT],EU 6th Framework Programme project Cross Compliance Assessment Tools (CCAT),"The data for this project was sampled within the EU 6th Framework Programme project Cross Compliance Assessment Tools (CCAT) (Contract no. 44423-CCAT, http://www.ccat.wur.nl/UK/).

In particular, by using a distribution dynamics approach based on Markov chains, we investigate the shape and behavior of the joint distribution of per-capita income and carbon dioxide emissions. We arrive at several interesting conclusions, especially in the context of international negotiations on climate change. First, evidence does not support theoretical models predicting the existence of a poverty-environment trap. Specifically, in the long-run two main groups of countries will emerge: poor versus polluting countries. Second, the typical development path leads initially to high emission levels and, subsequently, to high income. Third, the convergence process towards the stationary distribution is very slow. Finally, for carbon emissions, whenever it is observed, the environmental Kuznets curve seems to be only a transitory phenomenon.","[Bassetti, Thomas] Univ Padua, Dept Econ Marco Fanno, I-35123 Padua, PD, Italy; [Bassetti, Thomas] Univ Padua, Interuniv Ctr Growth & Econ Dev CICSE, I-35123 Padua, PD, Italy; [Benos, Nikos] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Karagiannis, Stelios] Ctr Planning & Econ Res KEPE, Athens 10672, Greece",University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Ioannina,"Bassetti, T (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, PD, Italy.",thomas.bassetti@unipd.it; nbenos@cc.uoi.gr; stkarag@kepe.gr,"Benos, Nikos/Z-5719-2019; Bassetti, Thomas/AAE-4756-2020","Bassetti, Thomas/0000-0003-0172-6658; Karagiannis, Stelios/0000-0002-7544-4330",,,,,63,22,23,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In order to examine the relationships between the variables linear regression analysis was conducted and to understand the mediating effects of firm's social responsibility multiple regression analysis was used. Regression results revealed that pessimistic evaluation about environment fully mediated the influence of learned helplessness on attitudes of individuals toward firms' environmental social responsibility behaviors.

As stock repurchases is an alternative to the cash dividends, there are two effects, firstly each share becomes more valuable than before because each shareholder now holds a greater percentage of ownership in the company and the increase in demand for the company's shares of stock by the company. Subsequently, the supply is being reduced and as a result prices will rise. The company can repurchase its own shares as it is an alternative way for the company to distribute value to the stockholders. Stock repurchases programs are motivated by the company to buy back its own shares from the marketplace or public and to reduce the number of outstanding shares.

This proposed research aim to (1) deepen understanding of the organisational and technological factors and conditions that contributes to clinicians' reluctance to use new IT systems in the NHS (2) offer practical guidelines that enables the NHS to reduce clinicians' reluctance and consequently improve the quality, safety and efficiency of healthcare delivery.","[Fernanado, Senaka] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Chelmsford, Essex, England",Anglia Ruskin University,,senaka.fernando@anglia.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1335,1340,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100141,0

This study aimed to investigate determinants (socio-demographic characteristics and attitudes) of acceptance of functional food in Western Balkans and to analyze to what extent these factors affected individuals' consumption of food with health claims. The findings indicate that individuals' age, education, standard of household, level of knowledge and skepticism on products with health claims and perception of some product attributes affect the frequency of functional food consumption. Profiles of typical consumers are distinguished through cluster analysis and discussed according to their socio-demographic features and attitudes. Functional food consumers in the Western Balkans differ from their global counterparts relative to their age, gender, presence of children in household and appraisal of healthiness of functional food. It is recommended that companies should provide consumers with more information on functional food and attempt to diminish the relevance of price through other product attributes. Since this paper presents the first cross-national assessment of factors that influence functional food consumption in the Western Balkans it will be a valuable benchmark for future studies in the field.","[Filipovic, Jelena; Stojanovic, Zaklina] Univ Belgrade, Econ 1Fac, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Filipovic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Econ 1Fac, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",jfilipovic@ekof.bg.ac.rs,"Filipovic, Jelena/AAS-7597-2020; Stojanovic, Zaklina/ABB-9134-2020; Filipovic, Jelena/AAS-7164-2020; Stojanovic, Zaklina/HGF-1039-2022","Filipovic, Jelena/0000-0003-4232-1948; Stojanovic, Zaklina/0000-0003-2878-9835; Filipovic, Jelena/0000-0003-4232-1948;",,,,,33,3,3,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,199,211,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300018,0

Wives often earned much less than their husbands. As a result, much of the redistribution at the individual level was effectively from high earning husbands to their own lower earning wives. In addition, spouse and survivor benefits accrue disproportionately to women from high income households. Both factors mitigate redistribution at the household level. It has been argued that with the increase in the labor force participation and earnings of women, Social Security now should do a better job of redistributing benefits at the household level. To be sure, when we compare outcomes for a cohort with a household member age 51 to 56 in 1992 with those from a cohort born twelve years later, redistribution at the household level has increased over time. Nevertheless, as of 2004 there still is substantially less redistribution of benefits from high to low earning households than from high to low earning individuals.","[Gustman, Alan L.; Tabatabai, Nahid] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Gustman, Alan L.] NBER, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Steinmeier, Thomas L.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Gustman, AL (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",alan.l.gustman@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

We hypothesize that institutional investors can influence corporate policy to employ governance mechanisms that reduce their monitoring costs. Our evidence shows that firms are more likely to hire a Big 4 auditor (our proxy for audit quality) when long-term institutional ownership is high, suggesting that long-term institutional investors view high-quality audits as a viable means of improving corporate governance while reducing their direct monitoring costs. We find no association between auditor choice and short-term institutional ownership. Next, we find that auditors charge higher fees (our proxy for audit risk) when short-term institutional ownership is high, consistent with short-term investors creating greater incentives for managers to act myopically. We find no association between audit fees and long-term institutional ownership. Taken together, our evidence suggests that long-term institutional investors demand higher quality audits to enhance corporate monitoring, and that short-term institutional ownership is positively associated with higher audit risk.","[Han, Sam] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Dept Accounting, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Tony] Oklahoma State Univ, Spear Sch Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Rees, Lynn] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, College Stn, TX USA",Korea University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School,"Kang, T (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Spear Sch Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",tony.kang@okstate.edu,,,,,,,58,18,18,3,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Over the years, government has put in place a phalanx of banking and non-banking institutions, agencies, programmes and initiatives to prime existing potentials in the entrepreneurial sector. These organisations/initiatives were designed to liberalise access to government support, facilities and incentives and provide a kaleidoscope of financial products to more entrepreneurial firms in the country. These efforts further complemented existing financing channels for entrepreneurs like credit from commercial banks to their customers. Paradoxically, a major challenge to the success of entrepreneurship in Nigeria is lack of finance. Since existing and fledgling entrepreneurs cannot access soft loans for their business projects, efforts for entrepreneurship development are frustrated. Lack of access to capital, therefore, remains an albatross to the whole entrepreneurship project in Nigeria. Extant policies meant to support entrepreneurship have failed due to embedded internal and external contradictions within the polity. These contradictions border on the frequent policy transmutation, government's lack of political will and commitment to the implementation of its programmes, corruption, ethnic and partisan considerations in the distribution of resources, among others. Using the theory of financial intermediary, this paper has identified existing hurdles affecting entrepreneurial finance and suggested proactive measures that government and financial institutions can take to spur entrepreneurial firms in the country. The authors contend that without liberalising access to capital and addressing embedded contradictions in place, entrepreneurship development efforts may remain mere rhetoric at best and at worst failed projects of government in Nigeria.","[Imhonopi, David; Urim, Ugochukwu Moses; Suleiman, Barnabas M.; Amusan, Tolulope Abiola] Covenant Univ, Dept Sociol, Coll Dev Studies, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,david.imhonopi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; ugochukwuurim@gmail.com; banystef@gmail.com; toluamusan2003@yahoo.com,"Imhonopi, David/AAD-5869-2020; Urim, Ugochukwu Moses/P-3233-2018","Imhonopi, David/0000-0001-8536-8514; Urim, Ugochukwu Moses/0000-0002-8823-3276; Barnabas, Suleiman/0000-0002-3965-7996",,,,,22,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2265,2273,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500221,0

While there are a number of justifications for the Fairtrade organization's decision, there are authors who feel that meaningful fair trade cannot be achieved with the inclusion of commercial farms. This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade on commercial farms and small-scale farmer cooperatives in South Africa. Fairtrade on South African commercial farms embraces a number of policy concerns related to land reform, BEE and sustainable development. The results of the study show that when commercial farms are included in the Fairtrade model, communities in which these farmers live benefit from developmental projects. In addition, in some instances, farm workers gain shares in the commercial farms, and benefit from the farm owners' knowledge and capital.","[Jari, Bridget; Snowball, Jeanette D.; Fraser, Gavin C.

We explain business cycle synchronization by the channel of international capital flows and boom-bust cycles. Using the vector auto-regression method, we find that most Asian countries experience boom-bust cycles following capital inflows, where the boom in output is mostly driven by consumption and investment. Empirical evidence also shows that capital flow shocks are positively correlated in the region, which supports the conclusion that capital market liberalization has contributed to business cycle synchronization.

The Committee found that the baking industry is also characterised by a high level of market power, with six baking groups being responsible for 80 per cent of South Africa's bread production. Hence, this study aimed to identify the factors that restrict the development of agro-processing in the small wheat-milling and baking industries in the rural areas of South Africa. Data was collected by means of a structured questionnaire and by conducting 15 interviews with various small wheat-milling and baking firms in the supply chain as well as with major roleplayers. The study found that the small wheat-milling and baking industries have relatively high barriers to entry, including the ability to acquire the required capital to start operations; to establish a market; to acquire knowledge of the wheat-milling and baking industries; to uphold a well maintained infrastructure; to acquire marketing-management knowledge; and to have the necessary cash flow. The only barrier to exit deemed to prevail in the wheat-milling and baking industries is the ability to sell machinery at book value. The study also found that small-scale wheat millers and bakers felt exposed to wheat price volatility, as they had neither the cash flow nor the knowledge to counteract these price risks by way of risk-mitigating strategies available through derivative markets. The study therefore concluded that large-scale wheat millers and bakers have a competitive advantage over their smaller counterparts, in that they have the economies of scale, necessary skills, knowledge and cash flow to overcome obstacles in a short period. Moreover, smaller wheat millers and bakers can take several months to recover from setbacks, which sometimes prove to be detrimental. The study further made some recommendations concerning these factors, in order to facilitate small-scale wheat millers' and bakers' development and expansion of production.","[Louw, Andre; Troskie, Gerhard] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Geyser, Mariette] North West Univ, UP Res Unit Environm Sci & Management, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa",University of Pretoria; North West University - South Africa,"Louw, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",andre.louw@up.ac.za; gerhard.troskie@up.ac.za; mariette.geyser@nwu.ac.za,,,,,,,13,7,7,0,19,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2013,52.0,3,,,,,101,122,,10.1080/03031853.2013.821746,0.0,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,196LG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322776100006,0

From a methodological point of view, the study is based on a dynamic panel model, which uses data for OECD countries for 2000-2010. The corporate taxation in the model is approximated with an appropriate tax quota and also with an appropriate part of the World tax Index. When analysing the optimal tax policy horizon concerning the corporate taxation, it was found that its effect is strongest in the case of a two-year lag. The lag must be taken into account in case of corporate taxation changes. This does not concern only the changes in statutory tax rates, but also other factors including progressivity of tax rates, administration costs, tax deductibility of costs, or possibilities to get tax investment incentives.","[Machova, Zuzana; Klikova, Christiana; Kotlan, Igor] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,zuzana.machova@vsb.cz; christiana.klikova@vsb.cz; igor.kotlan@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020; Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021; Klikova, Christiana/S-6798-2019","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216; Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600; Klikova, Christiana/0000-0001-9090-4190",,,,,39,3,3,0,9,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

From a policy perspective, the model implies that developing countries that are experiencing financial integration may attempt to alleviate the welfare cost of integration by stabilizing the exchange rate. Hence, this paper provides a novel explanation for fear of floating. For industrial countries that have the ability to operate efficient inflation targeting policy, financial integration is always beneficial. Thus, the different monetary regimes implemented in the industrial vs. the developing countries explain their divergent degrees of financial integration since the early 1990s. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

HIA identifies appropriate actions to manage those effects. Although existing laws and guidance support the inclusion of a comprehensive health analysis in Environmental Impact Assessment, current Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) practice usually does not link proposed actions and alternatives to health outcomes. A complete analysis of health effects would consider all potentially significant direct, indirect and cumulative health impacts associated with the proposed action and alternatives. The term Integrated Impact Assessment has been used to describe many different procedures but essentially any process which attempts to cover more than one type of impact assessment in a single process can be called an integrated impact assessment. Most commonly Integrated Impact Assessments combine an EIA and a HIA. The important issue is that consequences for health of policies and decisions should be properly considered.

To this end, environmental taxes have been proposed to address a wide range of issues including waste disposal, water pollution and air emissions. This study looked at environmental tax, and how it can be used as a tool for flood reduction in Nigeria. The research covers the local governments which are majorly affected by flood in Lagos state and copies of questionnaire were administered to the selected samples who are residents. The Spearman Rank Order Correlation which is a non-parametric test was used to measure the degree of association between the dependent and the independent variables. The findings revealed that there is a moderate positive correlation Rs=.398, p<.005) between imposition of environmental tax on nylon packages and reduction of flood and it is significant at 0.01. The study concludes that the implementation of environmental taxes on nylon packaging companies will lead to a reduction in the use of nylon as the major packaging system in Nigeria. The study therefore recommends that there should be a change in the packaging system in Nigeria as most of our products are made by nylon. The adoption of paper bags or cloth bag which has been adopted in developed countries especially in England should be emphasized.","[Uwalomwa, Uwuigbe; Uwuigbe, Olubukunola Ranti; Francis, Iyoha] Covenant Univ, Sch Business, Dept Accounting, Coll Dev Studies, Ota, Nigeria",Covenant University,,uwalomwa.uwuigbe@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; bukola.uwuigbe@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; iyoha.francis@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"uwuigbe, uwalomwa/KBA-0342-2024; Uwuigbe, Olubukunola/ABG-5621-2021; UWUIGBE, UWALOMWA/G-2903-2018","UWUIGBE, OLUBUKUNOLA RANTI/0000-0002-6566-1083; uwuigbe, uwalomwa/0000-0001-8769-3492",,,,,27,0,0,1,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2211,2221,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500216,0

Without bankruptcy protection, creditors can collect on defaulted debt to the extent permitted by wage garnishment laws. The elimination lowers the default premium on unsecured debt and permits low-net-worth individuals suffering bad earnings shocks to smooth consumption by borrowing. There is a large increase in consumer debt financed essentially by super-wealthy individuals, a modest drop in capital per worker, and a higher frequency of consumer default. Average welfare rises by 1% of consumption in perpetuity, with about 90% of households favoring the change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show interesting stylized facts on two main issues. First, we do not find evidence that comparative advantage in resource-intensive products is necessarily more persistent than comparative advantage in manufactured goods. Second, we analyze the interaction between specialization in manufacturing and natural resources abundance. Though it is less likely that resource-rich countries have comparative advantage in manufactured goods, the abundance of natural resources does not inhibit significant changes in specialization for these countries.","[Alvarez, Roberto] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Rodrigo Fuentes, J.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Alvarez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",robalvar@fen.uchile.cl; rodrigo.fuentes@uc.cl,"Fuentes, Rodrigo/AAF-4459-2020",,,,,,29,2,2,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The shocks that are investigated, however, almost exclusively represent unanticipated changes in policy, which surprise the private sector and which are typically found to have a delayed and sluggish effect on output. In this paper, we estimate a New Keynesian model that incorporates news about future policies to try to disentangle the anticipated and unanticipated components of policy shocks. The paper shows that the conventional estimates confound two distinct effects on output: an effect due to unanticipated or surprise shocks, which is smaller and more short-lived than the response usually obtained in the literature, and a large, delayed, and persistent effect due to anticipated policy shocks or news. News shocks play a larger role in influencing the business cycle than unanticipated policy shocks, although the overall fraction of economic fluctuations that can be attributed to monetary policy remains limited.","[Milani, Fabio; Treadwell, John] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Milani, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",fmilani@uci.edu; jtreadwe@uci.edu,,,,,,,33,50,52,4,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The number of labor inspectors per capita is used as a proxy for enforcement, while non-compliance is measured using an index of violation that measures both the proportion of individuals violated, as well as the average depth of individual violation. Because of the potential simultaneity between enforcement and compliance, the number of labor inspectors is instrumented by the number of non-inspectors. The results suggest that there are a variety of factors impacting on violation, including firm-level, sectoral, and spatial characteristics. One of the key determinants of violation is found to be the local unemployment rate.

A simple correlation coefficient suggests a positive relationship between the size of the shadow economy and the likelihood of entrepreneurial entry. However, this masks more complex relationships, if, as argued, the shadow economy is an embedded social phenomenon. With appropriate controls and instrumenting for potential endogeneity, the impact of the shadow economy on entry in a linear specification is found to be negative. Further, there is evidence of a U-shaped relationship: entrepreneurial entry is least likely when the shadow economy amounts to about a quarter of gross domestic product (GDP). At the individual level, an extensive shadow economy has a more negative impact on respondents who are risk averse. In addition, in the economies where property rights are stronger, the negative impact of the shadow economy is weaker.","[Estrin, Saul] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Mickiewicz, Tomasz] Aston Univ, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Aston University,"Estrin, S (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.estrin@lse.ac.uk; t.mickiewicz@aston.ac.uk,"Mickiewicz, Tomasz/AAC-8016-2019; estrin, saul/AAC-7000-2020","Mickiewicz, Tomasz/0000-0001-5261-5662; estrin, saul/0000-0002-3447-8593",,,,,43,48,54,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Moreover, it does not appear to be primarily driven by improvements in governance, disclosure, and access to capital associated with a U.S. cross-listing. Instead, we argue that a cross-listing enhances managers' reliance on stock prices because it makes stock prices more informative to them.

However, he also has a potentially conflicting incentive to use his information to generate trading profits. We show that a speculator can exploit this conflict and force the blockholder to buy a disproportionately large amount to prevent value destruction. This is costly for the blockholder because the trades must sometimes be executed at inflated prices. Given reasonable constraints on short sellers, a sufficiently large blockholder will have the incentive to absorb these losses and prevent a bear raid.

A panel model is used to evaluate differences in new firm starts within the states relative to the bank market structure and competition. The results indicate that states with more small banks, as measured by the number of unit banks, and banks with more branch locations contribute to new firm creation. Overall competition, as measured by the total number of banking institutions, has a negative effect on firm creation. There is limited evidence that bank failures also have a negative impact on firm creation within the state.","Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Econ Finance & Insurance & Risk Management E, Conway, AR 72035 USA",University of Central Arkansas,"Rogers, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Econ Finance & Insurance & Risk Management E, 201 Donaghey Ave, Conway, AR 72035 USA.",trogers@uca.edu,,,,,,,34,17,18,2,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The LandSys model simulates the spatial suitability of land use change over time based on both the land use suitability and the impacts of neighboring land use types in a CA model framework, coupled with individual decision-makers' behaviors with agent-based models (e.g., household, employment, and developer agents). To generate inputs for transportation models, two equilibriums in the land use market are considered: land development equilibrium simulates land use change at a manageable cell level (50 m x 50 m), while land supply-demand equilibrium allocates firms and agents based on the bid-rent theory. Data from Orange County, FL are used in a case study for model estimation and validation. A comparison of model results with actual data from 2000 shows that the proposed LandSys model is effective in estimating land use change, with an accuracy of 85.4%. The model is also responsive to land use policies and could be used for what-if analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we explore the mechanisms underlying the emergent gender assorting, using an experiment in which African villagers could form groups to share risk. We exogenously varied the extent to which grouping arrangements were enforced and, hence, the importance of trust and social enforcement as supports for group formation. Gender assorting was significant and considerable when grouping was perfectly enforced or depended on social enforcement. There was significantly less gender assorting when grouping depended on trust. Exploratory analysis suggests that this reduction in gender assorting may be owing to family ties and co-memberships in gender-mixed religions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In attempting to scale socio-technical systems practice theory finds itself needing to think about new possible strategies to both compete with other ontologies and rebrand itself as capable of mapping the world outside of everyday life, the domestic and the home. In pursuit of this goal three unfamiliar new terrains are explored: elites, elements and events. In this paper a method for practice theory to broach scale while retaining its current value is articulated through ideas about the synchronization of elements and through paying closer attention to elites and events in the ways practices are practised.

It is widely acknowledged that foreclosures hurt neighborhoods by devaluing the nearby properties through various channels. This paper offers a new way of conceptualizing and then estimating the potential effects of foreclosures on property values. Housing stock heterogeneity in the central city old neighborhood allows for the possibility that the impacts of nearby foreclosures may differ across types of housing. This study uses a dataset that covers twenty years of housing values from the City of Worcester (MA), and finds evidence that foreclosures of multi-family houses in close proximity influence the sales price of surrounding single-family properties after controlling for impact from foreclosure of nearby single-family houses. The most preferred estimate suggests that each multi-family foreclosure that occurs between 660 and 1320 feet away from the sale lowers the predicted sales price by approximately 3%. Nearby multi-family spillover impacts also persist over time. In addition, a new approach advocating for an alternative definition of housing submarket suggests that a distant foreclosure within the same submarket also lower sales price of a single-family home by 0.1%.

Their overall networks are compared with each other and with the networks of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines using several graph theory measures. FedEx and UPS are found to operate networks with a very high concentration of activity at their principal hubs (Memphis and Louisville, respectively), despite the proliferation of hubs and spokes in recent years.

Evidence from bonus payments to public employees in Japan This paper provides new evidence of consumers' reaction to an anticipated sizable change in income. Until FY2002, Japanese public employees received predictable large bonus payments three times a fiscal year (in June, December, and March), but the March bonus was abolished in FY2003. We compare the seasonal patterns of public employees' expenditure before and after the reform of the bonus payment schedule. Contrary to the prediction of the life cycle/permanent income hypothesis (LC/PIH), we find evidence that monthly patterns of household expenditure were significantly affected by the anticipated large change in income pattern. However, at closer inspection, this excess sensitivity of expenditure is observed only for expenditure subcategories of some durability, i.e., durables and semi-durables. Thus, while the LC/PIH does not appear to hold for expenditure (which we observe here), it may still hold for consumption. J. Japanese Inc. Economies 26 (3) (2012) 405-433.

The study was conducted in the city of Bydgoszcz. Poland, while the subsequent analysis is based on the authors' inventory of selected public buildings and interviews. 450 individuals with disabilities, plus 150 non-disabled members of the same households, were sampled and surveyed across the city. The results indicate that, in general, there are great differences between people with disabilities and their able-bodied counterparts. Disabled inhabitants choose forms of recreation not involving substantial financial inputs. As fares, availability and accessibility have the strongest impact on leisure activities, the preferred forms of recreation among disabled people are meetings with relatives and friends, the spending of free time at home or on an allotment, or walking. The biggest differences in behaviour between the two categories of respondent are in turn found to arise in the case of participation in sporting activities. In-depth research into the accessibility of recreation sites shows that some areas (such as the city centre) are mainly chosen by persons without serious mobility problems. Disabled people with a lower level of mobility (needing to use walking sticks, crutches, or wheelchairs) choose the attractive outskirts of the city where the opportunity for open-air recreation exists, or else spend their free time visiting relatives and friends. This attests to availability to some extent determining the spatial behaviour of persons with disabilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It argues that the decline in trade in the wake of sovereign debt crises documented in earlier studies is the result of a reduction in exporters' access to foreign credit. Using an annual panel of 28 industries in 100 countries between 1980 and 2007, it shows that default leads to a stronger contraction in the exports of sectors which are more dependent on external financing, consistent with this hypothesis. This finding is robust across different econometric specifications, and of economically significant magnitude. It suggests that any impact of sovereign default on trade, rather than a cost of default in its own right, may be a symptom of reduced access to international capital markets.

If global maize production is lower than usual owing to supply shocks in major exporting regions, Tanzania may be able to export more maize at higher prices, even if it also experiences below-trend productivity. Diverse destinations for exports can allow for enhanced trading opportunities when negative supply shocks affect the partners' usual import sources. Future climate predictions suggest that some of Tanzania's trading partners will experience severe dry conditions that may reduce agricultural production in years when Tanzania is only mildly affected. Tanzania could thus export grain to countries as climate change increases the likelihood of severe precipitation deficits in other countries while simultaneously decreasing the likelihood of severe precipitation deficits in Tanzania. Trade restrictions, like export bans, prevent Tanzania from taking advantage of these opportunities, foregoing significant economic benefits.","[Ahmed, Syud Amer; Martin, William J.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp Agr & Rural Dev, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",The World Bank; Stanford University; Stanford University; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Ahmed, SA (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp Agr & Rural Dev, 1818 H St NW,MSN MC3-307, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",sahmed20@worldbank.org,"Diffenbaugh, Noah S/I-5920-2014; Martin, William/E-6226-2011","Diffenbaugh, Noah S/0000-0002-8856-4964;",,,,,42,17,20,3,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Funds, capital, and employees are chosen as the inputs, whereas loans and other earning assets are outputs in this study. Our results show that technological gains transcend the efficiency regressions and result in total factor productivity growth. More specifically, technical progress in capital productivity reveals the dominant force behind the total factor technical change and productivity improvement. In addition, this paper uses these disaggregation terms to find out the competitive advantages and disadvantages of input usages for each Chinese bank.

Banks swap assets to diversify their individual risk. Two asset structures arise. In a clustered structure, groups of banks hold common asset portfolios and default together. In an unclustered structure, defaults are more dispersed. Portfolio quality of individual banks is opaque but can be inferred by creditors from aggregate signals about bank solvency. When bank debt is short-term, creditors do not roll over in response to adverse signals and all banks are inefficiently liquidated. This information contagion is more likely under clustered asset structures. In contrast, when bank debt is long-term, welfare is the same under both asset structures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis centers on two incentives, risk aversion and extended investment horizons, which potentially influence the level and type of investments that family firms undertake. We find that family firms devote less capital to long-term investments than firms with diffuse ownership structures. When dividing long-term investment into its two components of R&D and capital expenditures, we note that family firms, relative to nonfamily firms, prefer investing in physical assets relative to riskier R&D projects. Additional tests indicate that family firms receive fewer patent citations per dollar of R&D investment relative to nonfamily firms.

As in previous within-study comparisons, nonexperimental estimates differ from estimates based on random assignment when nonexperimental estimators are implemented without pretreatment measures of academic performance. With comparison groups consisting of students drawn from the same districts or districts with similar student body characteristics as the districts where treatment group students reside, using pretreatment test scores reduces the bias in nonexperimental methods between 64 and 96 percent. Adding pretreatment test scores does not achieve as much bias reduction when the comparison group consists of students drawn from districts with different student body characteristics than the treatment group students districts. The results suggest that using pretreatment outcome measures and comparison groups that are geographically aligned with the treatment group greatly improves the performance of nonexperimental estimators.","Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13224 USA",Syracuse University,"Bifulco, R (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13224 USA.",,,,,,,,19,72,89,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Since the extant literature on tax effects on capital structure studies listed firms in developed countries, it is worth investigating whether the same results apply to privately-held small and medium enterprises in transition economies. The findings provide significant evidence that lower taxes have affected the capital structure of Croatian firms, resulting in increased equity levels. These findings are consistent with the trade-off theory of capital structure, which suggests that lower taxes increase the incentive to hold equity due to decreasing interest tax deductibility of debt.","[Tzioumis, Konstantinos] US Dept Treasury, Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC 20219 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Tzioumis, K (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Off Comptroller Currency, 250 East St,SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA.",kostas.tzioumis@occ.treas.gov,,,,,,,50,4,4,1,26,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2012,68.0,2,,,,,165,190,,10.1628/001522112X639972,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,961BN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305439000003,0

We empirically test the methodology using a comprehensive sample of developed countries fixed income and equity indices, as well as sub-samples stratified by geographical region, time period, asset class and risk level. In general, our proposed combined methodology generates very competitive portfolios when compared to other methodologies, considering three evaluation dimensions: financial efficiency, diversification, and allocation stability.

Unfortunately, the proposed routes in the Northeast, Midwest, and Northwest will continue to chug along at medium-speeds and attract few new riders from among those who currently travel those areas via highway or air. The plan does indeed succeed in calling for TOO around high-speed rail stations. The HSIPR Program must, however, encourage local planning jurisdictions to broadly liberalize land use controls to allow for compact development rather than writing new zoning codes to require the intensive land uses developers desire anyway.

It lost its position as a key traffic hub for domestic to international air transport in Japan. Now the Japanese government is trying to expand its international role again by the resumption of international air services at the airport. A route choice probability model is applied to show how Haneda's hub competitive position in its connecting markets from Japan has changed since the resumption of these services. The results reveal that Haneda's market shares increased significantly in the markets between Japan and Asia-Oceania, between Japan and Europe and between Japan and North America. The dense domestic networks offered at Haneda appear to connect well with the newly started international flights to Asia-Oceania, Europe and North America. The competitive position of Haneda in the connecting markets from Japan is expected to increase towards 2013 when its international air networks will be expanded further. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This suggests the existence of an optimal fund scale. In spite of the potential diseconomies of scale, a non-trivial proportion of closed funds have new funds cloned-the scale motive would not be a complete explanation for the closure. When managers of closed funds clone new funds, they receive greater public attention and thus can attract more fund flows and charge higher fees. Furthermore, better-performing closed fund managers attract more fund flows to their new siblings, making the closure an effective mechanism to extract economic rents. Overall, we find that closing and cloning is an attractive strategy for funds seeking to increase their management fees and funds with more managers in place. Aspects of the closed fund family also affect the launch decision of new siblings. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

This unique data set on worldwide expropriation between 1960 and 2006 is used to highlight several (interrelated) stylized facts. First, although expropriations have become less frequent compared to the 1970s, the number of takings has risen since the mid-1990s. Second, foreign firms are more vulnerable to expropriation in resource-based sectors, particularly in mining and petroleum. Third, the timing of expropriation coincides with fluctuations in mineral output price levels. Finally, when newly constructed FDI stock estimates are used to compare the sectoral distribution of FDI of recent expropriating countries to that of non-expropriating countries, average resource-based FDI shares are higher in expropriating countries; however, this difference is not reflected in higher value added shares for the expropriating group. This last fact is puzzling given that natural resource-based FDI has traditionally been considered high risk.","Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Hajzler, C (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",chris.hajzler@otago.ac.nz,,"Hajzler, Christopher/0000-0001-9011-6581",,,,,45,63,78,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Using a novel dataset of exchange rate regime classification, the paper augments the gravity model of bilateral trade flows with measures of currency unions and conventional pegged arrangements, and benchmarks Africa's experience against the rest of the world. We find that in both samples, currency unions and pegs increase trade vis-a-vis more flexible exchange rate arrangements through channels in addition to reduced exchange rate volatility; however the effect is almost twice as large for Africa. In addition, the trade-generating effect of pegs is at least as large for Africa as that of currency unions, suggesting that pegs could present a viable option-perhaps an alternative to currency unions-to promote trade in the region.

It is better described by a nonlinear policy reaction function with a target range as opposed to a point target. It responds much more vigorously to appreciating or depreciating pressure outside the target range but the response is much more muted within the range. Moreover, the tolerance band is asymmetric i.e., the RBI responds much more strongly to appreciating pressure than depreciating pressure. Such a policy response in an era of continuous net capital inflows accounts for the large buildup in foreign exchange reserves witnessed in India in the recent past. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

That may be cold comfort, considering that more than 8 million jobs have been lost since the recession began. The Federal Reserve has lowered its policy rate as far as it can go, and the economy is flush with liquidity. Yet the unemployment rate remains persistently high. From policymakers to private citizens, the debate continues over what to do to help the labor market adjust. Disagreements stem, in part, from the complicated nature of the labor market itself. There are many moving parts, and the authors examine several here, pointing out that a one size fits all approach may not accommodate the differences across various sectors of the economy. The authors examine structural change, frictions in matching workers with job openings, lack of consumer and business confidence, the severity of the past recession, and other factors to help inform and illuminate this complex policy debate.

In a contested sector two agents struggle to appropriate the maximum possible fraction of a contestable output. In an uncontested sector, they hold secure property rights over the production of some goods. Agents split their resource endowment between butter, guns and ice-cream. The latter denote productive activities secure from appropriation. It is shown how improvements in productivity can countervail destructive impact of continuous conflicts. Eventually, the basic model is extended to consider a government and a rival group.

This paper uses a unique, comprehensive database of regulatory capital requirements on all UK banks to examine their effects on capital, lending and balance sheet management behavior. We find that capital requirements that include firm-specific, time-varying add-ons set by supervisors affect banks' desired capital ratios and that resulting adjustments to capital and lending depend on the gap between actual and target ratios. We use these results to measure the effects of a capital regime that includes features similar to those embedded in the UK framework. Our results suggest that countercyclical capital requirements may be less effective in slowing credit activity when banks can readily satisfy them with lower-quality (lower-costing) capital elements versus higher-quality common equity. Given the size of the UK banking sector and the global nature of many of the largest institutions in the UK banking sector, the results have implications for the ongoing debate surrounding the design and calibration of international capital standards.

Based on an extensive review of the contemporary literature, we aim to clarify key concepts and definitions around the notion of social impacts, and to give them an identity distinct from economic and environmental impacts and from existing notions of 'distributional issues'. We primarily focus on five short-term or 'immediate' categories of social impact, namely accessibility, movement and activities, health-related, financial related and community-related impacts. We then consider the spatial, temporal and socio-demographic distributional effects of transport at every level of planning, policy and systems delivery. We also briefly discuss some of the longer-term social consequences of these social impacts in terms of health, individual and community wellbeing and social equity and justice. The paper is designed as an introduction to a wider discussion of these themes in this Special Issue Social Impacts and Equity Issues in Transport. Our overall aim for the paper is to demonstrate that, by overlooking the social impacts and social equity implications of transport decision-making at every level of the decision-making process, we are fundamentally undermining quality of life and social well-being in our towns, cities and rural settlements. Conversely, we believe that integration and consideration of the social impacts of transport planning and delivery can significantly increase the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of a number of other important areas of economic and social policy, including employment, health, education and economic development.

The precrisis bubble in securitization can be traced to incentive conflict that allows national safety nets to subsidize leveraged risk-taking. Safety-net subsidies encouraged regulation-induced innovations that enabled firms to take hard-to-monitor risks and to make themselves politically, administratively, and economically difficult for government officials to fail and unwind. This paper summarizes the incentive conflicts that led creditors and internal and external supervisors to short-cut and outsource due diligence. The Dodd-Frank strategy of reform does not adequately acknowledge or address these conflicts. The key step needed is to develop an effective statistical metric for measuring the ex ante value of safety-net support in the aggregate and at individual institutions. To accomplish this, government and industry need to rethink the informational obligations that insured financial institutions and their regulators owe to taxpayers as de facto investors and to change the way that information on industry balance sheets and risk exposures is reported, verified, and used. Without reforms in the practical duties imposed on industry and governmental officials and in the way these duties are enforced, financial safety nets will continue to expand and their expansion will undermine financial stability by generating large rewards for creative and aggressive risk-takers that are smart enough to cash in their share of safety-net benefits before they evaporate.

Based on a unique firm-level panel data set of more than 500 small-and-medium-sized borrower firms in Japan, we find that borrowers with high observed riskiness are more likely to pledge collateral. In addition, we find that borrowers that provide collateral to lenders experience larger increases in profitability and reductions in riskiness than borrowers that do not. The main channel through which the borrower enhances its profitability is cost-cutting restructuring. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that collateral reduces moral hazard by providing borrowers with an incentive to enhance their creditworthiness. J. Japanese Int.

Each trader can therefore rely on his own past experience as a trader and on other traders past experience. The former is the direct component of the reputation mechanism and the latter the indirect component (Bolton, Katok, & Ockenfels, 2004a, 2004b). We design an experiment for isolating the direct component of the reputation system and studying its effect on the level of trust and reciprocity in a population where agents play both roles (trustor and trustee). Our experiment consists on three treatments of a finitely repeated investment game (Berg, Dickhaut, & McCabe, 1995). In the reference treatment there is no reputation mechanism at all, in treatment 1 trustees can build up a direct reputation, and in treatment two players can build up a direct reputation for both roles. We find that trustees' direct reputation has a positive effect on reciprocity, but does not affect the average trust in the population. Trust is significantly higher only when players can build up a reputation in both roles. We show that the increase in trust is mainly linked to the formation of mutual trust-reciprocity relations.

While court opinions and competition agency decisions have focused on non-practicing patent holders as synonymous with trolls and hold up problems, this view of upstream specialists is far too narrow. In fact, patents in the hands of nonpracticing entities can increase competition, increase innovation, lower downstream prices, and enhance consumer choice. We explain why and when and argue for more business-model-neutral policy when it comes to patent licensing. Clearly, patents are a complex subject that cannot be portrayed as either all good or all bad; tradeoffs will always be involved. Likewise, patents in the hands of nonpracticing entities cannot be viewed as either all good or all bad. Without a better understanding of the many complicated effects of patents in high technology markets, we run the very real risk of misguided policy decisions. In light of that risk, we argue that more attention needs to be devoted to finding meaningful ways of identifying harmful behaviors, rather than on categorical labels based on firm structure or business model.","[Layne-Farrar, Anne] Compass Lexecon, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Geradin, Damien] Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr TILEC, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Geradin, Damien] Howrey LLP, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Padilla, A.

However, not much research has been carried out into their implementation at the local level. Consequently, reforms are described in old-fashioned terms. Through comparative case studies in Tanzania, this article unpacks implementation as a process consisting of multiple administrative layers and potential actors. It concludes that implementation is slow and uneven due to the decoupling of layers within the formal land administration.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the uniform investment strategy is rational in situations where an agent is faced with a sufficiently high degree of model uncertainty in the form of ambiguous loss distributions. More specifically, we use a classical risk minimization framework to show that, for a broad class of risk measures, as the uncertainty concerning the probabilistic model increases, the optimal decisions tend to the uniform investment strategy. To illustrate the theoretical results of the paper, we investigate the Markowitz portfolio selection model as well as Conditional Value-at-Risk minimization with ambiguous loss distributions. Subsequently, we set up a numerical study using real market data to demonstrate the convergence of optimal portfolio decisions to the uniform investment strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Under simultaneous moves, there is no carbon leakage. However, in the sequential-move game, carbon leakage occurs; the leader sets its pollution tax lower than that in the simultaneous-move game and lower than the marginal damage from own pollution, while the follower sets its tax higher than that in the simultaneous-move game. The only motive behind the leader's underregulation of own pollution is to reduce the incidence of transboundary pollution from the follower. If pollution is a pure global public bad, aggregate pollution is higher in the sequential-move game than in the simultaneous-move game. The leader (follower) obtains higher (lower) welfare than that under simultaneous moves. Hence, if countries can choose to be leaders or followers, they choose to move first to set environmental taxes.","[Sikdar, Shiva] Yonsei Univ, E Asia Int Coll, Wonju 220710, South Korea; [Lapan, Harvey E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Yonsei University; Iowa State University,"Sikdar, S (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, E Asia Int Coll, 234 Maeji, Wonju 220710, South Korea.",shivasikdar@gmail.com; hlapan@iastate.edu,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

In a context of financial markets' imperfections, migration may act as a substitute for imperfect credit and insurance provision (through remittances from migrants) and, thus, exert a positive effect on investment. However, it may well be the case that remittances are channelled towards increasing consumption and leisure goods instead. Exploiting within family variation and an instrumental variable strategy, we show that migration indeed accelerates productive assets' accumulation. However, when we look at the effect of migration on non-productive assets (durable goods), we find a negative effect. Our results then suggest that poor rural families resort to migration as a way to mitigate constraints that prevent them from investing in productive assets.","[Montes-Rojas, Gabriel] City Univ London, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Chiodi, Vera] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Jaimovich, Esteban] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",City University London; Paris School of Economics; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Montes-Rojas, G (通讯作者)，City Univ London, 10 Northampton Sq,D306 Social Sci Bldg, London EC1V 0HB, England.",gabriel.montes-rojas.1@city.ac.uk,"Jaimovich, Enrique/A-2782-2008; Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/M-4750-2015","Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/0000-0002-8447-4929",,,,,40,43,49,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

While the academic and political debate on the costs and benefits of privatization is vast, a focus on the rationale for public enterprises, from the standpoint of Social Cost Benefit Analysis, is missing. This paper aims at filling this gap and provides a normative discussion on public enterprises in a general equilibrium setting. The conditions under which public provision may be beneficial and the metrics for evaluating polices and projects under (a) symmetric information and (non) benevolent governments are presented in three welfare propositions. The main policy message points to the overall quality of institutions as a necessary pre-condition for socially desirable public enterprises. A sound institutional environment provides policy-makers with the correct incentives to design and implement meaningful policies even if public administrators adopt sub-optimal plans. Institutions should constrain self-interested policy-makers from disrupting the key welfare signals for policy adoption as well as for project appraisal, while bias in management is a relatively less important concern.","[Del Bo, Chiara; Florio, Massimo] Univ Milan, DEAS, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Del Bo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, DEAS, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",chiara.delbo@unimi.it,"DEL BO, CHIARA F./L-1555-2017","DEL BO, CHIARA F./0000-0002-8684-5383",,,,,60,31,33,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The public expenditure expansion significantly improved the distribution of income across different household groups where it reduced both the Malay-Chinese and Malay-Indian income inequality as well as reduced income disparity between rural and urban areas. However, the improvement in income inequality is much larger in the Eight Malaysia Plan than the Ninth Malaysia Plan. This could reveal that the public expenditure expansion in the Eight Malaysia Plan gave more opportunities to the Malay to increase their income. It could also indicate that there were differences in the pattern or composition of the public sector expenditure in both plans that had influenced income distribution among the household sector which result a more significant success in the Eight Malaysia Plan.

In addition, we reveal that the longer the control chain from the listed company to its ultimate owner, the higher the ADFEE that company will pay. We also find that there is a negative relationship between the discrepancy and ADFEE when we pool our sample together. However, when we divide our samples into large firms and small firms, we find that such a negative relationship only holds for big-size firms while for small-size firms, ADFEE are positively correlated. This discrepancy being due to small firms' lack of bargain power and the increase in auditing risk.

Within this context, this study aims to explore whether human development or the factors (income, education and health) which determine human development play a role in international migration flows, and whether migrants find an opportunity to increase their human development levels. In line with this aim, the direction of international migration flows was analyzed having compared both the 2011 human development indexes of the countries which compose the 27 biggest migration corridors as of 2010 and the main components of the human development index, which are health index, education index and income index. According to the results of the study, migrants move to more developed regions in terms of human development and among the factors which determine human development in terms of migration the most important ones are respectively income or education and health. Therefore, the removal of obstacles before international migration is considered to play a great role in the increase of human development or global welfare. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from a sample of 32 project management teams on POS DRU program, out of a population of 145 members. Team roles were identified applying BTRSPI. To assess team current level of motivation was used a tool proposed by Woodcoock and Francis (2008). Team roles balance was assessed with the developed model. Motivation indices of each team were tested against the team balance scores by using Spearman's rank test. Findings - A statistical relation between team roles balance and team motivation was found. Team roles balance provides an environment which encourages individuals to contribute and provides higher motivation. It is argued that authors do not use constructs according to Belbin's theory of team balance. Research limitations/implications - There is need for an improved construct, which is isomorphic with Belbin's notions of team balance. The relation between this construct and performance should also be tested. Practical implications - In literature the current team balance constructs are of limited use. As the various constructs give different assessments of balance and no strong suport was found for Belbin's team roles balance, these developed model should be used. Implications are suggested for more qualitative measures for designing balanced teams. Originality/value - Team design according to this construct has not been tested up to now with regard to team motivation. The study simplifies on the ambiguity of the concept of team balance.

The seductive advantage of the brands, the plain packaging of generic products seem to vanish under the scrutiny of the new somewhat bleak economic perspectives; yesterday's private labels are today's new brands and consumers seem to cannot have enough of them, in the new post-recession economy, as their level of penetration is considered to be as high as 40 % in certain markets. After the shock of the recession following the financial crisis of 2008-2010, as the consumers slowly return to spending, it is hardly expected that they will behave as they did before the crisis. In the Romanian DIY retail, a sector severely affected by the current recession, different players attempt to identify and implement product strategies that would bring competitive advantage and stop the decline in turnover and market share. Our objective is demonstrated how the implementation of private label strategies may be one of the key answers for the retailers operating on the Romanian market. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For the first group, we obtained an EU creativity research database on Hungarian high school teachers, 337 persons. In our second sample we asked university students, 292 persons, and their opinion about the creativity-related statements taken over from the EU research. In the third sample group we surveyed the opinion of 112 HR experts via personal enquiry and online about the importance and measurability of creativity, the statements of the EU project and the definition of creativity. Thus in our analysis three different groups high school teachers, university students and HR experts interested in fresh graduates evaluated the 13 creativity-related statements drawn up by EU researchers. In our study we analysed the HR experts' responses in most detail. First we present the results along three research questions. We examine how important HR experts representing companies deemed creativity when hiring fresh graduates, in which field they regarded creativity important, and what tools they used most often to measure it. In the second part of our analysis we compare the responses of the university students, the high school teachers participate in the survey, and last but not least those of the HR experts regarding the 13 creativity-related statements of the EU research.

Less than a decade ago the company surprised friends and foes by entering the industry through a series of large and well-timed takeovers that changed the face of the European meat industry. A new strategy for VION is needed, as competition in the meat industry is rapidly becoming global in nature and having a profound impact on the competitive dynamics in Europe. Major global players including Smithfield Foods (based in the USA), Brazil's JBS Swift, and Perdigao, are penetrating and expanding into European territory. New geographical markets for meat companies emerge in Eastern Europe and Asia. Meanwhile, incumbent competitors such as Danish Crown (based in Denmark) and Tonnies (Germany) are beefing up their competitive efforts, while many meat market segments in Europe have reached maturity. The diversity of distinctive and hard-to-copy strengths of major competitors confronts VION with much food for thought. For instance, a number of competitors (such as Perdigao) have important cost advantages over VION. Others enjoy a very strong supply base (such as Danish Crown), have outstanding technological capabilities, and own important genetic assets (such as Smithfield). Will the competition be able to set new rules of the game in the European meat industry? What strategy should VION pursue to maintain the initiative in changing the European meat industry, and stay ahead of the competition?","[Rademakers, Martijn F.

For every firm, we construct the set of other films producing the same output using the set of product market competitors listed in the firm's public Securities and Exchange Commission filings. In addition, we improve measurement of capital structure by explicitly accounting for leased capital. These two steps increase the explanatory power of the average capital structure of other firms producing similar output on a firm's capital structure by 50% compared to using only the average unadjusted debt ratio of other firms in the same three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. We provide evidence that the large explanatory power of the capital structure of other firms producing similar output is related to the assets used in the production process.

A new concept of 'sustainable bank' begins to rise. The exact concept of 'sustainable bank' is evolving over time and is still a subject of debate.

In this paper we consider the implications of external habits for optimal monetary policy, when those habits either exist at the level of the aggregate basket of consumption goods or at the level of individual goods. External habits generate an additional distortion in the economy, which implies that the flex-price equilibrium will no longer be efficient and that policy faces interesting new trade-offs and potential stabilization biases. Furthermore, the endogenous mark-up behavior, which emerges when habits are deep, can also significantly affect the optimal policy response to shocks, as well as dramatically affecting the stabilizing properties of standard simple rules. I discuss several lessons regarding the design and conduct of monetary policy that have emerged out of the New Keynesian research program. Those lessons include the benefits of price stability, the gains from commitment about future policies, the importance of natural variables as benchmarks for policy, and the benefits of a credible anti-inflationary stance.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision similarly to the IFRS Advisory Council develops overall requirements for risks assessment and determines the structure of items included in calculation of capital adequacy in relation to the state and the progress of the financial crisis. The paper is focused on evaluation of relationships between individual requirements during financial crisis. The paper evaluates the selected relationships among these requirements, which are identical in several procedures, but some of these requirements are not mutually consistent mainly in assessment and evaluation of risks in relation to provisioning. It points to the need for recognition of provisions for LIS/IFRS and for capital adequacy purposes and recommends options for unification of these requirements. Various methods of analysis, synthesis and comparison have been used in the paper.","[Schwarzova, Maria] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,maria.schwarzova@euba.sk,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3527-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,325,334,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEZ44,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318886500024,0

The intertemporal model presented here takes into account several sources of external shocks for small economies such as a change of the real interest rate and the real exchange rate. Model used for computation heavily relies on second generation of intertemporal model firstly presented in paper by Bergin and Sheffrin (2000). Thanks to the model we are able to estimate possible development of the current account of the Slovak Republic for the next 20 quarters. Our results suggest that the model has a high predictive power in explaining the cyclical part of the consumption based current account.

Our model predicts that limited loanable funds can initially contain main bank controlled overinvestment, even when new equity is available to the firm. Abundant funds facilitate overinvestment to the detriment of firm profitability. A shift of control rights back to the firm due to financial deregulation produces an equity for upside potential and bank debt for downside risk bias against the banks. A stock market and real estate boom in Japan made it harder than ever for the banks to diversify risk. The insights from this analysis help explain why Japan's main bank system was beneficial in the (capital constrained) postwar period but became harmful during the (capital abundant and even bubbly) 1980s. and why the adverse shocks of the post-deregulation 1990s had such severe effects on the banking system.

Our qualitative in-depth case studies show that a permanently high level of the five EO dimensions is not a necessary condition for long-term success, as traditional entrepreneurship and EO literature implicitly suggest. Rather, we claim that the level of EO is dynamically adapted over time and that the original EO scales (autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness) do not sufficiently capture the full extent of entrepreneurial behaviors in long-lived family firms. Based on these considerations we suggest extending the existing EO scales to provide a more fine-grained depiction of firm-level corporate entrepreneurship in long-lived family firms.","[Zellweger, Thomas; Sieger, Philipp] Univ St Gallen, Ctr Family Business, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Zellweger, T (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Ctr Family Business, Dufourstr 40A, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",thomas.zellweger@unisg.ch; philipp.sieger@unisg.ch,,,,,,,84,219,241,1,115,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Empirical tests of panel data of 16 machinery products from 2000Q1 to 2012Q2 show that a decrease in the unit prices of Chinese exports leads to a decrease in the demand for Korean exports. In contrast, a decrease in the unit prices of Korean exports does not lead to a decrease in the demand for Chinese exports. In addition, lagged Chinese prices have bigger impacts on current Korean prices than lagged Korean prices on current Chinese prices. Simulation experiments investigating the impacts of a change in exchange rates on the Chinese and Korean export volumes also confirm that the Korean variables do not affect the Chinese export volume as much as the Chinese variables affect the Korean export volume. Overall, the findings in the present paper indicate that China has already emerged as a formidable competitor to Korea in the Japanese machinery market. J. Japanese Int. Economies 34 (2014) 256-271.

We find that the impact of reforms varied both with the degree of liberalization and pre-reform policies: the clear positive impact on productivity was stronger in East and Southern Africa, especially where competition increased most. The impact on cultivated areas and production is less clear. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We also derive optimal levels of pesticide use with and without Bt, taking into account health and environmental externalities. This has not been done previously in the literature. Conventional cotton growers suffer from significant insect crop damage; they underuse pesticides from a profit-maximizing perspective. Yet, the picture is reversed when externalities are also considered. The social optimum of pesticide use is much lower than the private optimum, and both optima are lower with Bt than without this technology. Bt controls pest damage more effectively. Hence, yields on Bt farms are about 20 per cent higher in spite of lower pesticide use. Large pest damage is a typical phenomenon in developing countries. In such situations, Bt can contribute to productivity growth, while reducing pesticide applications and associated negative externalities.","[Kouser, Shahzad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Fac Social Sci, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Gottingen,"Kouser, S (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Fac Social Sci, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",drshahzadkouser@gmail.com; mqaim@uni-goettingen.de,"Kouser, Shahzad/ABD-7680-2020; Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763",,,,,56,22,24,1,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Finally, we find that institutional trade imbalance is positively related to the post-announcement abnormal returns of negative events.

We find that non-floating exchange rate arrangements are associated with more widespread exposure as well as a greater magnitude of firms' exposure. Cross-sectional analyses suggest that the exchange rate regime is an important determinant of firm-level exchange rate exposure for emerging market firms, and that pegged exchange rate regimes amplify exposure. This result holds after controlling for a wide range of potential determinants of firm-level and country-level foreign exchange exposure.

We analyze operational risk disclosures by US financial firms during 1995-2009 and their impact on different measures of information asymmetry in the firms' equity markets. Effective spreads and the price impact of trades are shown to increase around the first announcements of such events and to revert after the announcement of their settlement. This is especially pronounced for internal fraud and business practices related events. Market makers respond to higher information risk around the first press cutting date by increasing the quoted depth to accommodate an increase in trading volumes. The degree of information asymmetry around operational risk events may be influenced by the bank's risk management function and the bank's governance structure. We indeed find that information asymmetry increases more strongly after events' first announcements when firms have weaker governance structures lower board independence ratios, lower equity incentives of executive directors, and lower levels of institutional ownership. In contrast, the firms' risk management function has little to no impact on information asymmetry. We interpret this as evidence that the risk management function is primarily driven by regulatory compliance needs. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of information asymmetry around operational risk announcements. They help to shed light on the role that regulation and corporate governance can play in order to establish effective disclosure practices and to promote a liquid and transparent securities market.

In this vein, we contribute to the rich literature on global liquidity in two different ways: on the one hand, to achieve a global series in terms of common monetary policy shocks, we propose a distinction between common and idiosyncratic factors across economies, as proposed by Bai and Ng (2004). Our second innovation stems from the consideration of a Markov-switching vector error correction model when analyzing time-varying short-run dynamics. Having identified the long-run structure which includes a proportional relationship between commodity prices and global liquidity in the first step, our results indeed show that the impact of a global liquidity measure on different commodity prices is significant and varies over time. One regime approximately accounts for times where commodity prices significantly adjust to disequilibria, while the second regime is characterized by either a weak or no commodity price adjustment. The fact that global liquidity also reacts to disequilibria in a specific regime demonstrates the two-way causality between monetary policy and commodity prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Following a proxy contest, directors experience a significant decline in the number of directorships not only in the targeted company, but also in other nontargeted companies. The results are established using the universe of all proxy contests during 1996-2010. To isolate the effect of the proxy contest, our empirical strategy uses within-firm variation in directors' exposure to the possibility of being voted out and exploits the predetermined schedule of staggered boards that allows only a fraction of directors to be nominated for election every year. We find that nominated directors relative to non-nominated ones lose 58% more seats on other boards. The evidence suggests the proxy-contest mechanism imposes a significant career cost on incumbent directors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

After the US credit crunch in 2007 and the world financial crisis in the following years, some anomalies were observed as China's stock market was more interdependent of the global market than the US stock market in some specific periods.

In an environment without taxes and bankruptcy costs, the results are generally consistent with the Modigliani-Miller Propositions 1 and 2. However, the first proposition should be presented and interpreted more carefully, as given firm characteristics, there is only one optimal capital structure. Thus, a firm's capital structure is relevant. A relaxation of assumptions about either taxes or bankruptcy costs leads to conclusions that are generally different from those in Modigliani and Miller (1958). The model predicts that leverage and sales-to-capital ratios decrease but firm size and capital stock increase with the subjective discount factor of the firm's manager if there are taxes and bankruptcy costs. The empirical analysis supports these predictions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize the threshold after which the agents are rich enough to access the market, where the relative liquidity is lower, and show that the relative liquidity of the whole financial system (banks and markets) drops because of the increasing market participation.

We find that AT causes an improvement in two measures of price efficiency: the frequency of triangular arbitrage opportunities and the autocorrelation of high-frequency returns. We show that the reduction in arbitrage opportunities is associated primarily with computers taking liquidity. This result is consistent with the view that AT improves informational efficiency by speeding up price discovery, but that it may also impose higher adverse selection costs on slower traders. In contrast, the reduction in the autocorrelation of returns owes more to the algorithmic provision of liquidity. We also find evidence consistent with the strategies of algorithmic traders being highly correlated.

Instead, we examine the dynamic consequences of design and implementation strategies, when the actual economy features expectational heterogeneity. Agents have either rational or adaptive expectations. Consequently, the central bank's ability to achieve price stability under heterogeneous expectations depends on its objective and implementation strategy. An expectations-based reaction function, which appropriately conditions on private sector expectations, performs exceptionally well. However, once the objective introduces policy inertia, popular strategies have similar determinacy properties, but they are less operational.

Economic optimization seeks input-output combinations to maximize profits. Environmental optimization searches for input-output combinations that minimize the polluting effects of materials balance on the surrounding environment. Ecological optimization looks for input-output combinations that minimize the cumulative destruction of the entire ecosystem. Using an aggregate space, the framework illustrates that these optimal scales are often not identical because markets fail to account for all negative externalities. Profit-maximizing firms normally operate at the scales which are larger than optimal scales from the viewpoints of environmental and ecological sustainability; hence policy interventions are favoured. The framework offers a useful tool for efficiency studies and policy implication analysis.

Our empirical analysis exploits that the economic impact of changes in the international food prices differs across countries depending on whether countries are net food importers or exporters. We construct an international food net-export price index that captures this heterogeneity. Our panel fixed effects analysis yields that in low-income countries within-country variations in the international food net-export price index are significantly negatively related to democratic institutions.

In stationary equilibrium, inflation nonlinearly alters the endogenous distributions of income, wealth, and consumption. Small departures from zero inflation have the strongest impact. Three features determine how inflation impacts distributions and welfare: financial structure, shock persistence, and labor supply elasticity. When agents can self-insure only with money, inflation reduces wealth inequality but may raise consumption inequality. Otherwise, inflation reduces consumption inequality but may raise wealth inequality. Given persistent shocks and an inelastic labor supply, inflation may raise average welfare.

This article provides evidence on the impact of three main measures of public CC funding in Quebec (the provincial tax credit, the federal income tax deduction, and the direct subsidies to early childhood centers) on family income, female labor market participation and provincial and federal public finances. Unlike the existing Canadian literature, this impact is estimated using a structural model of labor supply that explicitly incorporates the work/leisure preferences of families. This model also takes into account the provincial and federal tax and transfer system, the effect of fixed costs to working, the variability of the costs of CC, and the distribution of the socio-demographic characteristics of Quebec families. Public CC funding increases family income significantly (after taxes, transfers and CC expenses); it also has a greater impact on incomes and female labor market participation for single mothers than for biparental families. Cuts in public CC funding would result in substantial savings for the provincial government but would have little impact on the federal government.","[Clavet, Nicholas-James] Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Duclos, Jean-Yves] Univ Laval, CIRPEE, CIRANO, IZA, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Clavet, NJ (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,28,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

At the level of individual goods and services, the average contribution of these wages is significantly reduced, reflecting that good-specific sources of price dispersion, such as trade costs and good-specific markups, tend to average out across goods.

We hypothesized and found that transgressors are willing to pay less compensation to a victim who believes the transgression happened intentionally (as opposed to unintentionally), but only so when they share no future interaction perspective together.

It proposes a method to find out whether risk shifting is present in the banking industry and, if so, what type. The type of risk shifting depends on the group of debt holders to whom risk is shifted, We apply this method to the US banking sector in 1998-2011. To study the relationship between risk shifting and the 2008 crisis, the sample is also split into pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods. Our results suggest that the same type of risk shifting is present in the entire sample and in the pre-crisis and crisis subsamples. We find no evidence of risk shifting after the crisis. Furthermore, holding capital buffers seems to disincentivize risk shifting. This finding appears to provide support for the conservative buffer included in Basel III. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such decisions are characterized by attitudes towards ambiguity, which are distinct from risk attitudes. Most studies of ambiguity attitudes have focused on the static case of single choice, where decision makers typically prefer risky over ambiguous prospects. However, in many situations, decision makers may be able to sample outcomes of an ambiguous alternative, allowing for inferences about its probabilities. The current paper finds that such sampling experience reverses the pattern of ambiguity attitude observed in the static case. This effect can only partly be explained by the updating of probabilistic beliefs, suggesting a direct effect of sampling on attitudes toward ambiguity.","[Ert, Eyal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Trautmann, Stefan T.] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Trautmann, Stefan T.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ Ctr, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Tilburg University,"Trautmann, ST (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",eyal.ert@mail.huji.ac.il; s.t.trautmann@uvt.nl,", Eyal/AAW-1928-2020",", Eyal/0000-0001-6507-3532",,,,,34,28,31,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We set up a canonical growth model with damages in the household's welfare function and two energy sources - non-renewable and renewable energy. To produce renewable energy a capital stock must be built up. A socially optimal solution is considered that takes into account the negative externality from the non-renewable energy. We also study how the optimal solution can be mimicked in a market economy by policies using subsidies and tax rates. To solve the model numerically, we use Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. We study when a transition to renewable energy takes place and whether it occurs before the non-renewable resource is exhausted.

Trades of each group are negatively correlated with contemporaneous price changes. To test for return predictability, we sort stocks into quintiles based on each group's past trades and then form long-short portfolios. Stocks most heavily bought have significantly higher returns than stocks most heavily sold over the two weeks following a sort. Cross-sectional analysis shows smaller, more volatile, less actively traded, and less liquid stocks more often appear in the extreme quintiles. Time series analysis shows the long-short portfolio returns are positively correlated with a market-wide measure of liquidity. A double sort using past trades of specialists and competing market makers produces a long-short portfolio that earns 88 basis points per week (act as complements). Finally, we identify a chain of liquidity provision. Designated market makers (NYSE specialists) initially trade against order flows and prices changes. Specialists later mean revert their inventories by trading with competing market makers who appear to spread trades over a number of days. Alternatively, specialists may trade with competing market makers who arrive to market with delay. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find that firms with lower stock liquidity have higher acquirer gains for takeovers of private targets, but not for takeovers of public targets. The negative relation between liquidity and acquirer gains is stronger when the threat of disciplinary trading (exit) by institutions is weaker and acquirers have higher agency costs. Acquirers of private targets with lower stock liquidity are more likely to withdraw deals and experience higher involuntary CEO turnover following value-destroying acquisitions.

Our analyses-in which the candidates' appeal is based on their policy positions and their campaigning skills-suggest a surprising conclusion: namely, that strategic and expressive primary voting typically support identical equilibrium configurations in candidate strategies.

Racial inequality and residential segregation,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Segregation; Racial inequality; Neighborhood formation; Negative feedback loop; General equilibrium,SAN-FRANCISCO; TRANSPORTATION; NEIGHBORHOODS; LOCATION; MODELS; PRICE; AREA; RACE,"This paper sets out a new mechanism involving the emergence of middle-class black neighborhoods that can lead segregation in American cities to increase as racial inequality narrows. The formation of such neighborhoods requires a critical mass of highly educated blacks in the population, and leads to an increase in segregation when those communities are attractive for blacks who would otherwise reside in middle-class white neighborhoods. To assess the empirical importance of this neighborhood formation mechanism, we propose a two-part research design. First, inequality and segregation should be negatively related in cross section for older blacks if our mechanism operates strongly, as we find using both the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. Second, a negative relationship should also be apparent over time, particularly for older blacks. Here, we show that increased educational attainment of blacks relative to whites in a city between 1990 and 2000 leads to a significant rise in segregation, especially for older blacks, and to a marked increase in the number of middle-class black communities. These findings draw attention to a negative feedback loop between racial inequality and segregation that has implications for the dynamics of both phenomena. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The procedure is depicted as a sequential game in which stakeholders first decide whether to engage in an informal renegotiation. Second, conditional on opting for renegotiation, the debtor and its creditors may succeed or fail in reaching an agreement to restructure the firm's capital structure. We test different hypotheses that capture (i) coordination and bargaining power issues, (ii) informational problems, (iii) firm characteristics, and (iv) loan characteristics. The empirical implementation is based on sequential LOGIT regressions. First, we find that the likelihood of informal renegotiations increases with loan size and the proportion of long-term debt. These two results support the argument that size matters when deciding whether to opt for informal renegotiation. Second, the probability of a successful renegotiation decreases when (i) the bank in charge of handling the process is the debtor's main creditor and when (ii) the firm is badly rated and its management is considered faulty. Third, the estimations show that collateral plays a significant role in the first stage of the renegotiation process. However, it does not impact the likelihood of success in reaching a renegotiated agreement. Finally, some banks are clearly better than others at leading successful renegotiation processes.

After cointegration is found between the stock markets of interest, the PMG estimates show evidence of each market's sensitivity to the fluctuations of the other markets over both the short- and long-run, supporting the feedback hypothesis. The impact of developed markets on emerging markets is more important than that of emerging markets on developed markets and the bidirectional impact is higher between emerging and Western European markets than between these emerging markets and the United States. These conclusions are robust to an alternative specification, which supports the view that the stock markets are closely interlinked.

This approach complements existing empirical work on capital structure, which typically estimates regression models of leverage for a broad set of firms. Because large investments are mostly externally financed, security issuances should provide information about managers' attitudes toward leverage. We find that issued securities move firms toward target debt ratios. Firms also tend to issue more equity following a share price run-up, consistent with both the tradeoff hypothesis and managerial efforts to time market sentiment.

As expected, the state-owned commercial banks play a significant role, attracting foreign players keen to participate in this consistent economic progression. We calculate the banks' distance-to-default measures in a pre- and post-GFC scenario, and note that overall banks are not facing significant distress levels. The association between distanceto-default and credit growth is positive, albeit diminishing in a pre-GFC context. It is only when we separate the foreign from the local banks that idiosyncratic features emerge. We find that foreign banks have reduced their exposure to loans in the post-GFC period and are more financially distressed. The Chinese banking system and its loan quality is directly linked to real estate values and government supported infrastructure projects. Clearly, in China the two-way causality of both bank growth and its soundness partly depends on these projects' propensity in generating sufficient cash flows to repay the bank loans.

The Taiwan's government has a policy of developing Taoyuan International Airport (TPE), the major international airport in Taiwan, as one of main hubs in East Asia, based on the airport's access to Mainland China. To assess whether the airport is progressing toward meeting the set expectation, this study evaluates the changes in airline networks of the TPE after the opening of direct flights across the Taiwan Strait. The time-dependent earliest arrival time algorithm is applied to global flights in 2004, 2008, and 2012. Empirical evidence demonstrates that providing direct flights across the Taiwan Strait has significantly increased accessibility from TPE to airports in China, but did not improve the centrality of TPE. Additionally, the transfer dependency of TPE on other airports is increasing significantly. This result was based on two major reasons: the first involves the Chinese government's refusal to allow Chinese citizens to use airports in Taiwan as transfer points to and from other countries and the second reflects the competitiveness among airports and airlines in the region. The key finding is that political exclusion of airline use by external governments via travel regulations adversely influences the development of an airport as a global hub. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that borrowers initially attempt to inhibit their knee-jerk reaction to retaliate against a lender who has engaged in egregious lending practices when compared to a financially conservative lender. Moreover, when defaults are rare, borrowers are less likely to default because violating the social norm results in feelings of disgust. Finally, when a lender refuses a loan modification, the borrower is found to seek retribution. Interestingly, granting even a modest loan modification removes the desire of homeowners to seek retribution towards their lender no matter what their impression of the lender may be.

This time-geographic study contributes with knowledge on how mobility is influenced by individual, social and geographical contexts. Illustrated by four cases, our result show that retirement changes the preconditions for mobility and creates new space-time restrictions. To spend more time on projects that were previously carried out outside working time, such as caring for grandchildren, volunteer work and household responsibilities, influenced the informants' demands for mobility and choice of transport mode. However, the informants have resources that can be seen as strategies to overcome space-time restrictions. Most of the informants found it important to structure the day, to some it was vital to have something to do during the day while others enjoyed the possibility to take each day as it comes. Everyday mobility was a way of forming a structure by getting out of the house, either just for a walk or for making errands. The informants' embodied experiences of mobility influenced their choice to walk and cycle for transport for the reasons of comfort, get fresh air, or simply to get out of the house. The daily mobility pattern that was established was a result of individual preferences and resources as well as negotiations with family members. We conclude that the transition to retirement is a period when new mobility patterns are considered, evaluated and practiced. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding how individuals adjust their expectations is crucial to the evaluation of this policy, since retirement expectations directly affect other important decisions such as labour supply, engagement in (further) education and, of course, savings and investments. We consider the 2007 German pension reform that legislated an increase in the statutory retirement age from 65 years to 67. Our analysis is based on a longitudinal study that directly asks respondents at what age they expect to retire. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we look at the changes in subjective retirement expectations over time and estimate the extent to which they can be attributed to the 2007 reform. We find that the reform shifted the retirement expectations of the younger cohorts, although there is some heterogeneity in the way individuals adjusted. While there are no significant differences between men and women, lower-educated individuals failed to revise their expectations. As these individuals usually acquire both lower pension claims and lower private savings, the fact that they have been slower in updating their retirement expectations causes concern regarding their income security after retirement.","[Coppola, Michela] Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich, Germany; [Wilke, Christina Benita] Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Coppola, M (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich, Germany.",coppola@mea.mpisoc.mpg.de; wilke@hwwi.org,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,19,20,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

But they might also differ from entrepreneurs without industry experience on a variety of other dimensions: preferential access to resources or differing motivations, for example, may account for their decisions to enter known industries instead of new ones. Combining novel data from a representative survey of entrepreneurs with the matched employer-employee database of all residents in Denmark, we examined how entrepreneurs with prior industry experience differed from those without it, and the extent to which those differences could account for the performance premium associated with prior industry experience. We found that entrepreneurs with industry experience came from younger, smaller, and more profitable parent firms, and that they recruited more experienced employees, worked harder, and placed less value on having flexible hours. The recruitment of more experienced employees and the greater effort exerted appeared to account for at least some of the performance advantage associated with prior industry experience.","[Dahl, Michael S.] Aalborg Univ, DRUID, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Sorenson, Olav] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Aalborg University; Yale University,"Dahl, MS (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, DRUID, Fibigerstr 11, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",md@business.aau.dk; olav.sorenson@yale.edu,"Sorenson, Olav/ABE-5373-2020; Dahl, Michael S./M-9867-2019; Dahl, Michael S.

These interventions appear to have changed behavior by altering beliefs, norms, and preferences. However, because psychological interventions are often coarse, they have also resulted in inadvertent, offsetting side effects. This article discusses the interactions between environmental preference-making and economics, and then it examines three areas of environmental interest -electric cars, recycling, and local conservation efforts-where psychological interventions have created strong, widespread, and simple environmental views. However, in all three cases, simple environmental rules of thumb can lead to significant adverse environmental side effects. Local environmentalism, for example, may increase carbon emissions by pushing development from low emission areas, like coastal California, to high-emission areas elsewhere in the United States. I conclude with a discussion of a fourth issue: how economic analysis of the political supply of ideas can be helpful in understanding the remarkable disparity of views concerning climate change.","[Glaeser, Edward L.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Glaeser, Edward L.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, 79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu,,,,,,,73,22,24,0,50,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

However, in this specific knowledge context, only a few academics recognize opportunities and act on them through entrepreneurial activities (e.g., spin-offs). A plausible explanation could be the existence of several filters that limit the total conversion of knowledge into economically useful knowledge. The vehicle to knowledge transfer is entrepreneurship. Therefore, the main actor is the academic entrepreneur, but no empirical study has highlighted the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship at the individual level. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of academics' start-up intentions and knowledge filters on the knowledge transfer process within entrepreneurial university. Adopting the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship and the planned behavior theory, a proposed model was tested with a sample of 207 academics enrolled in entrepreneurial universities in Spain using structural equation modeling. Our findings could provide insights for policy-makers to design policies that bring further benefits to society and educational organizations as well as significant contributions to the literature.","[Guerrero, Maribel] Orkestra Basque Inst Competitiveness, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain; [Guerrero, Maribel] Deusto Business Sch, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain; [Urbano, David] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Business Econ Dept, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University of Deusto; University of Deusto; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Guerrero, M (通讯作者)，Orkestra Basque Inst Competitiveness, Mundaiz 50, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain.",maribel.guerrero@orkestra.deusto.es; david.urbano@uab.es,"Guerrero, Maribel/C-5978-2008; Urbano, David/GLQ-6309-2022; Urbano, David/B-6879-2009","Guerrero, Maribel/0000-0001-7387-1999; Urbano, David/0000-0001-7600-8656; Urbano, David/0000-0001-7600-8656",,,,,92,99,108,6,182,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The rule allows people to select a final collective ranking by submitting a bid vector with six components (the six possible rankings of the three alternatives). We test experimentally the robustness of the rule to subsidies and taxes as well as to tie-breaking assumptions. We have two main results. First, the most frequently chosen ranking is the socially efficient one when ties are broken in favor of the alternative generating the highest social welfare, but not when ties are broken randomly. Second, subsidies slightly enhance overbidding. Furthermore, an analysis of individual bid vectors reveals interesting behavioral regularities that result from selfishness, other-regarding preferences, and indifference. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using robust methods can result in large confidence sets making precise inference difficult. We overcome this problem in the analysis of the hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve and a forward-looking Taylor rule by employing stronger instruments. We suggest exploiting information from a large macroeconomic data set by generating factors and using them as additional instruments. This approach results in stronger instrument sets and hence smaller weak-identification robust confidence sets. It allows us to conclude that there has been a shift toward more active monetary policy from the pre-Volcker regime to the Volcker-Greenspan tenure.,"[Mirza, Harun] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Storjohann, Lidia] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Bonn, Germany",European Central Bank; University of Bonn,"Mirza, H (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",harun.mirza@ecb.int; lidia_st@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

This paper views the implementation of TELs as a principal-agent problem. Agency theory predicts that delegation is affected by the preferences of agents and the costs of monitoring those agents. Using panel data for the US states from 1970 through 2008, I conduct an empirical test of the validity of the principal-agent model for TELs. I find that state spending limitations are only effective at cutting the growth of state and local spending under the direction of agents who have a preference for limited government. Additionally, state property tax limitations are only effective when monitoring does not require costly coordinated action. These findings contradict an alternative theory of TEL implementation that looks towards the policy's origin. My research suggests that the arrangements of delegation determine when and under what conditions TELs effectively reduce government growth.","Lewis & Clark Coll, Portland, OR 97219 USA",,"Seljan, EC (通讯作者)，Lewis & Clark Coll, 0615 Southwest Palatine Hill Rd, Portland, OR 97219 USA.",eseljan@lclark.edu,,,,,,,47,17,18,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2014,159.0,3-4,,,,,485,501,,10.1007/s11127-013-0063-0,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3PD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333157200010,0

A genuine Digital Single Market would generate new types of growth and also sustainable economic and social benefits for all European citizens. There are still a number of barriers which impose obstacles for the development of the digital market in Europe. Obstacles which can be identified include national differences regarding data protection rules, e-commerce rules, consumer protection rules and other legislation pertaining to information flows. The paper brings in discussion the advantages of a Digital Single Market, the obstacles in developing it in connection with e-commerce regulations, consumer protection and information flows legislation and also the premises for implementing a Digital Single Market. Consumers' trust in on-line commerce results as one of the driving factors in implementing a Digital Single Market. These are some of the main obstacles for the boosting consumers' confidence in the European Single Market.

The latter was to identify the consumer awareness of the rights stipulated by article 6 of the directive, as well as to study the opinions of consumers relative to the information that online stores are compelled to supply before purchase. The first objective was accomplished by applying the content analysis method to the information available on the Web for a sample of 100 online stores. The second objective was achieved through the survey method on a sample of 351 persons from the 25 to 34 age group, residing in Bucharest. Compared to other studies, the major contributions of the present research approach are the following: the investigation of an extensive sample of online stores; the wider range of products; the focus on both online stores and consumers.

The conventional cointegration tests fail to find the long-run equilibrium for any country-pairs except Taiwan, but cointegration tests with structural breaks demonstrate the long-run connections between exchange rates and fundamentals for some country-pairs. Evidence from the VECM with structural breaks reveals that exchange rates bear the burden of adjustment toward the long-run equilibrium in three countries during the floating exchange rate regime. The direction of causality between exchange rates and fundamentals appears to vary over time in the S. Korea-U.S. pair. However, there is a uni-directional causality in the Canada-U.S., Japan-U.S., and Thailand U.S. country-pairs. That is, the Canadian dollar/dollar, yen/dollar, and baht/dollar exchange rates contain information about future changes in macroeconomic fundamentals which correspond to the implications of the asset-pricing model of exchange rates. Finally, this study determines the time-varying causality between both variables during several sub-periods using a boot-strap rolling window approach for the four country-pairs.

There are two types of capital and the efficiency of labor depends positively on the consumption of the non-traded commodity. Effects of inflows of foreign capital on social welfare and human capital formation are examined. The analysis finds that while capital that is used in all the sectors may improve welfare, capital used specifically in the non-traded sector is likely to affect social welfare adversely. These results, which hold for a wide range of parameter values, can at least question the desirability of allowing entry of foreign capital in the non-traded final good sector that emanates externalities.

DRIs are more likely when the information gap vis-a-vis related industries is more severe or the firm has greater market power. DRIs have a significant impact on firm value/performance, especially when information problems are worse. Furthermore, DRIs help firms handle industry shocks and shorten their cash conversion cycles. Overall, our evidence suggests that firms choose DRIs when the adverse effects due to conflicts of interest are dominated by the benefits due to DRIs' information and expertise.","[Dass, Nishant] Georgia Inst Technol, Scheller Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA; [Kini, Omesh] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Nanda, Vikram] Rutgers Business Sch, Newark, NJ USA; [Onal, Bunyamin] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Espoo, Finland; [Wang, Jun] Baruch Coll, New York, NY USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Newark; Aalto University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Dass, N (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Scheller Coll Business, 800 West Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.",nishant.dass@scheller.gatech.edu,"nanda, vikram/P-8953-2019","nanda, vikram/0000-0003-2463-4940",,,,,71,151,179,6,78,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Evidence from drug offenders and the Higher Education Act of 1998,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial aid; College enrollment; Drug offenders,CRIME; STOCK; HOPE,"In 2001, amendments to the Higher Education Act made people convicted of drug offenses ineligible for federal financial aid for up to two years after their conviction. Using rich data on educational outcomes and drug charges in the NLSY 1997, we show that this law change had a large negative impact on the college attendance of students with drug convictions. On average, the temporary ban on federal financial aid increased the amount of time between high school graduation and college enrollment by about two years, and we also present suggestive evidence that affected students were less likely to ever enroll in college. Students living in urban areas are the most affected by these amendments. Importantly, we do not find that the law deterred young people from committing drug felonies nor did it substantively change the probability that high school students with drug convictions graduated from high school. We find no evidence of a change in college enrollment of students convicted of non-drug crimes, or of those charged by not convicted of drug offenses. In contrast to much of the existing research, we conclude that, for this high-risk group of students, eligibility for federal financial aid strongly impacts college investment decisions.

Similar trends are evident elsewhere in Latin America, and have occurred in the developed world. Such trends pose challenges to the financial sustainability of social security systems as working-age populations decrease and those in retirement increase both because of demographic trends and decisions to take early retirement. In this study, we find that the Mexican social security system provides incentives to retire early. The retirement incentives of the Mexican social security system affect retirement behavior, and may be one of the main contributors to early retirement decisions, particularly for lower-income populations. We simulated the effect of the reform from a pay-as-you-go to the new Personal Retirement Accounts (PRA) system and we find that the PRA system also provides incentives for early retirement.

However, these cutoff rules can be traced to underwriting guidelines for originators, not for securitizers. Moreover, loan-level data reveal that lenders change their screening at credit score cutoffs in the absence of changes in the probability of securitization. Credit score cutoff rules thus cannot be used to learn about the moral hazard effect of securitization on underwriting.

The choice of a departure railway station in a multiple-station region,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Number of railway stations; Access to rail stations; Railway planning; Integrated planning; Logsum approach,ACCESS; DEMAND; MODE; BUS,"Promoting the use of rail is an important element in sustainable transport policy. One of the most important decisions to make in planning the railway network is on the number of stations to provide. Stations are the access points to rail services and while each additional station increases rail's accessibility it also slows the service for those not using a particular station thereby making rail less attractive. In most large cities there are several, often many, railway stations, and understanding how passengers choose a departure station is important for planning the number of railway stations in a particular urban region and for understanding how the urban transport network provides access to different stations. Using the Dutch Railways (NS) customer satisfaction survey, a discrete choice analysis is carried out of the choice of a departure station, out of 11 available, by passengers living in the Amsterdam region. The results confirm the importance of the access journey to the station in determining the overall (dis)utility from travelling by rail. The welfare effect of closing a station in the Amsterdam area is computed by using the logsum approach, leading to the conclusion that it would not be beneficial to reduce the number of stations in Amsterdam. This suggests that increasing the number of stations where trains stop may well be welfare improving for the Amsterdam region. The paper concludes by advocating for an integrated analysis of rail and local public transport services, and for an integrated planning of inter-city rail and urban public transport networks, with focus on the number of rail stations within the urban area.

When we consider investment grade stocks, the importance of the CDS market in price discovery improves but the stock market still dominates the price discovery process. The results for different sizes of stocks generally suggest that both markets are important for price discovery but it is the stock market that dominates. We also find that while the price discovery process was affected by the 2007 global financial crisis, the stock market still dominated the price discovery process. Finally, in an economic significance analysis, we show that investors in the CDS market are able to make relatively more profits from a forecasting model that takes into account price discovery compared to a model that simply ignores the role of price discovery.

Competition includes extensive investment in projects for port expansion, dredging, and multimodal transportation for greater hinterland connectivity, fueled in part by uncoordinated federal port investments without a larger strategic vision for national port and trade infrastructure. One of the competing ports is in Savannah, Georgia, which is the country's fourth busiest container port. Savannah is about to embark on a $652 million project that will dredge thirty-two miles of the Savannah River from 42 to 47 feet to attract and accommodate Post-Panamax container ships. The paper analyzes the geographic coastal impacts of port competition, and looks at the unique circumstances of the Greater Savannah Metropolitan Region in planning for future growth of its port. The case illustrates the geographic tensions of uncoordinated maritime freight and logistics planning with fragile coastal and riparian ecologies. The dramatic interventions in port excavation also demonstrate how global forces of technological change and port expansions in other parts of the world are reshaping local geographies.

Our article makes important contributions to the research of both religion and entrepreneurship. First, it proposes empirical evidence in which the country's main religion significantly affects its level of entrepreneurship at the macro level. Second, it adds to our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms that characterize the effects of religion on entrepreneurship. We suggest that macro effects of religion as part of the country's culture and institutions affect the country's level of entrepreneurship beyond the direct effects of religion on the behavior of the religion's members in the society.","[Zelekha, Yaron; Avnimelech, Gil; Sharabi, Eyal] Ono Acad Coll, Fac Business Adm, IL-55000 Kiryat Ono, Israel",,"Zelekha, Y (通讯作者)，Ono Acad Coll, Fac Business Adm, 104 Tzahal, IL-55000 Kiryat Ono, Israel.",yaronzl@013.net.il; gilavn@gmail.com; eyals@ono.ac.il,"Avnimelech, Gil/J-7063-2016","Avnimelech, Gil/0000-0002-7102-809X",,,,,113,56,69,3,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using bilateral panel data between 1980 and 2000, we find that intraregional migration on the subcontinent is predominantly driven by economic opportunities and sociopolitics in the host country, facilitated by geographical proximity. The role played by network effects and environmental conditions is also apparent.

Using a dynamic loan market competition model where borrowers face both exogenous and endogenous costs to switch between banks, we uncover a competition softening effect of securitization that allows banks to extract rents in the primary loan market. By reducing monitoring incentives, securitization mitigates winner's curse effects in future stages of competition thereby decreasing ex ante competition for initial market share. Due to this competition softening effect, securitization can adversely affect loan market efficiency while leading to higher equilibrium profits for banks. This effect is driven by primary loan market competition, not by the exploitation of informational asymmetries in the secondary market for loans. We also argue that banks can use securitization as a strategic response to an increase in competition, as a tool to signal a reduction in monitoring intensity for the sole purpose of softening ex ante competition. Our result suggests that securitization reforms focusing exclusively on informational asymmetries in markets for securitized products may overlook competitive conditions in the primary market.

The resulting energy-mix can supply the energy needs of two sectors. These sectors differ in the additional abatement cost they have to pay for consuming clean rather than dirty oil, as Sector 1 (industry) can abate its emissions at a lower cost than Sector 2 (transport). We show that it is optimal to begin by fully capturing Sector 1's emissions before the ceiling is reached. Also, there may be optimal paths along which the capture devices of both sectors must be activated. In this case, Sector's 1 emissions are fully abated first, before Sector 2 abates partially. Finally, we discuss the way heterogeneity of abatement costs causes sectoral energy price paths to differ.","[Amigues, Jean-Pierre] LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ INRA, Toulouse, France; [Lafforgue, Gilles] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France; [Moreaux, Michel] LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ IDEI, Toulouse, France",INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Lafforgue, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, 20 Bd Lascrosses,BP 7010, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France.",g.lafforgue@esctoulouse.fr,,"Lafforgue, Gilles/0000-0002-9363-2108",,,,,21,6,6,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The additional intermediate targets feature environmental protection as a process rather than a contest for reaching a final target. The regulating agency is Nature, although political agencies might implement a similar regulation. We test milestone effects by varying the size of milestones in addition to changing the marginal productivity of individual contributions and the payoff risk.

Empirical estimates, obtained using monthly data, suggest the biasedness of futures quotes as a predictor of the future spot rate for contracts with maturities of two and three months. We also find significant time-varying risk premiums in the considered futures market, while the premium is of greater magnitude and more significant with increasing maturity of the contracts. We then examine the relationship between realised risk premiums and explanatory variables such as spot currency returns, the futures basis and realised volatility, skewness and kurtosis of spot currency returns.

FaceReader scores were associated with self-reports of the advertisement's effectiveness. Building on work describing the role of emotions in marketing research, we examined the relationship between the patterns of the FEBE and the perceived amusement of the advertisements, attitude toward the advertisement (AAD) and attitude toward the brand (AB). Differences were observed between FEH scores in response to high-, medium-, and low-amusing video advertisements (AVAs). Positive correlations were found between FEH and AAD and FEH and AB in high-and medium-but not in low-AVAs. As hypothesized, other basic emotions (sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust) did not predict advertisement amusement or advertisements' effectiveness. FaceReader enabled a detailed analysis of more than 120,000 frames of video-recordings contributing to an identification of global patterns of facial reactions to amusing persuasive stimuli. For amusing commercials, context-specific FEH features were found to be the major indicators of advertisement effectiveness. The study used video-recordings of participants in their natural environments obtained through a crowd-sourcing platform. The naturalistic design of the study strengthened its ecological validity and demonstrated the robustness of the software algorithms even under austere conditions. Our findings provide first evidence for the applicability of FaceReader methodology in the basic consumer science research.","[Lewinski, Peter; Fransen, Marieke L.; Tan, Ed S.

To address this matter, this paper exploits a quasi-experimental dimension of the imposed dwelling size limit by applying the difference-in-difference estimator. Data for this study were extracted from the Swedish National Insurance Board's database on housing allowance recipients, which comprises data previously unavailable for research. The estimation results suggest that this policy shift induced single-parent households living in rental housing to decrease their consumption of interior space, yielding a statistically significant increase in moves into overcrowded conditions, an effect that is even greater for single parents with one child than for those with two or more children. This effect runs directly counter to two long-term stated goals of the Swedish housing allowance system: (1) to induce households to move into better housing, thereby increasing their housing consumption, and (2) to prevent families with children from living in overcrowded conditions.

Landowners in countries with large industrial sectors attempt to suppress education levels to maintain their labor supply, as educated workers are able to move into industrial work more easily than uneducated workers. However, the relationship between large landowners and education is more complex than has been previously theorized. Using a specific-factors model, I show that large landowners in countries with little economic development actually have an incentive to increase education levels. They realize the returns of an educated workforce without fearing their mobility because competing industrial opportunities for the workers do not exist. In either case, the ability of landowners to achieve their political goals is a function of their ability to overcome the collective action problem and effectively influence the state's provision of education. Powerful landowners successfully deny education in industrialized countries and provide it in agricultural countries. An analysis of panel data covering 77 countries from 1975 to 2000 confirms the conditional nature of the relationship.","[Pennock, Andrew] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Pennock, A (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Taubman Ctr Amer Inst & Publ Policy, Box 1977, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",andrew_pennock@brown.edu,,,,,,,62,3,4,0,27,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The paradox may pose real problems to democratic decision making such as decision deadlocks and democratic paralysis. However, its relevance has been discussed again and again since the celebrated works of Arrow (Social choice and individual values, 1963) and Black (The theory of committees and elections, 1958). The discussion varies from one extreme to the other: from very relevant to practically irrelevant. This paper tries to bring more clarity to the discussion by reviewing the literature on the empirical relevance of Condorcet's paradox. Since a definition of the paradox for even numbers of voters and alternatives, and for weak voter preferences is missing in the literature, we first define the paradox clearly and simply. Then, three topics are investigated, namely domain conditions, culture and the likelihood of the paradox, and the empirical detection of the paradox. Domain conditions express regularities in voter-preference profiles that prevent the paradox. Frequent observations of these domain conditions would make Condorcet's paradox empirically less important. Cultures define probability distributions over the set of voter preferences.

Empirically, we find that intermediary leverage is negatively aligned with the banks' Value-at-Risk (VaR). Motivated by the evidence, we explore a contracting model that captures the observed features. Under general conditions on the outcome distribution given by extreme value theory (EVT), intermediaries maintain a constant probability of default to shifts in the outcome distribution, implying substantial deleveraging during downturns. For some parameter values, we can solve the model explicitly, thereby endogenizing the VaR threshold probability from the contracting problem.","[Adrian, Tobias] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Shin, Hyun Song] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Princeton University,"Adrian, T (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",tobias.adrian@ny.frb.org,,"Adrian, Tobias/0000-0001-9379-9592",,,,,41,211,251,1,83,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The aim of this article is to study whether bank support can help small businesses (SBs) exporting at the extensive as well as the intensive margin. We address this issue by using a large database on small Italian firms. We provide an empirical analysis of the role of bank support in affecting the firms' export decisions. Our results show that among the exporting SBs those using bank services to support their exports have a higher probability of being better placed in both the intensive and the extensive margin. Moreover, these positive impacts on export are statistically significant only when the main bank of the firm is an internationalized bank. These results have relevant policy implications as well as consequences for the business models of internationalized banks.","[Bartoli, Francesca; Rotondi, Zeno] UniCredit, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Ferri, Giovanni] Lumsa Univ, Dept Econ & Polit Sci, I-00192 Rome, Italy; [Murro, Pierluigi] Luiss Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, I-00197 Rome, Italy",UniCredit Group; Universita LUMSA; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Murro, P (通讯作者)，Luiss Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",pmurro@luiss.it,"MURRO, Pierluigi/AAH-5198-2020; Ferri, Giovanni/H-5598-2016","MURRO, Pierluigi/0000-0002-7743-5024; Ferri, Giovanni/0000-0002-7825-7098",,,,,38,25,26,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper demonstrates that this method is subject to a hindsight effect (as prior returns influence levels of new investment) and derives a technique that corrects it. The results show that for mainstream U. S. equities, DW returns are low because of this hindsight effect (bad investor timing had very little impact). Thus, low DW returns do not imply that the risk premium is correspondingly low.","City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",City University London,"Hayley, S (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",simon.hayley.1@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,3,4,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Different degrees of substitutability between urban greenspaces are considered. These findings are then extrapolated to all major British cities to obtain per household and aggregate valuation estimates for each scenario both with and without distributional weights.

I find that margin requirements, when there are no other market frictions, reduce the volatility and correlation of returns as well as the risk-free rate, but increase the market price of risk, the risk premium, and the price of risky assets. Furthermore, margin requirements generate a strong cross-sectional dispersion of stock return volatilities.

As shown by the global financial crisis, the revision of Basel II was necessary in order to reflect the current trends on the global financial markets. The purpose of this article is to analyse the impact of the Basel III introduction within the banking system of Romania. The new regulatory proposals established within the Basel III Accord will not affect the Romanian banks in a significant manner because they already report high equity ratios and sufficient cash flow. However, some negative effects should be expected. In this article, we will present the effects of applying the measures proposed by Basel HI and their impact on the Romanian banking sector. One of the most important direct effects refers to the newly-introduced liquidity requirements as well as to the higher equity ratio requirements for counterparty risk. The indirect impact includes a reduced profitability of small banks due to a slow growth of the Romanian economy and to the unpredictable reaction of foreign parent banks which own a large majority, of the banks operating in Romania.","[Apetri, Anisoara Niculina; Hlaciuc, Elena; Mihalciuc, Camelia Catalina] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Apetri, AN (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",anisoara_1978@yahoo.com; elenah@seap.usv.ro; cameliam@seap.usv.ro,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1422,1432,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300146,0

Just across Padang city there are areas of subduction, which can trigger a powerful earthquake and generate tsunami. Geologists have to say that the city of Padang is the area that is highly vulnerable to tsunamis in the near future. Several studies have been conducted to prepare Padang city for tsunamis. Through the research, maps of tsunami inundation area has been successfully designed. So that the tsunami-prone areas, and tsunami safe area can be clearly identified. According to Singh (2008), the time interval between the first powerful earthquake and tsunami to hit the coast of Padang is about 20-30 minutes. While residents have to walk 3-5 km to the safe area. It can be said that the time for tsunami evacuation in Padang city is very short. Therefore the choice of conducting vertical evacuation is urgent for the majority of the population rather than walking along the horizontal evacuation. Padang city government with the aid of the international donors has built buildings for the shelter. Some of them are schools that have a strong structure, three storeys in which the roof are served as a tsunami evacuation. Data from the BPBDs office (Disaster Management Agency), stated that there are 13 tsunami evacuation buildings at this time with a total capacity of 30.550 people and the capacity for each building is varied between 1,000 -3,000 people (BPBDs, 2013). This amount is very far from enough when compared to the potential loss of life as many as 400,000 people or more, or as only 7.64% of the total amount. And the location of the shelter buildings are not evenly distributed in tsunamis prone areas Places for vertical tsunami evacuation in Padang are called TES (Temporary Evacuation Shelter). There have been 13 shelters established by the Government of Padang and BPBDs, and there is only one TES found in the study area. It really is not enough as it is seen in the range of services. Therefore the existing buildings and multi-storey structure is another alternate places to rescue in which they are expected to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis. This alternative building called Potential TES (PTES) and there are 14 shelters for the study area. By using GIS analysis as well as buffer analysis method, a measurement against a range of services from 1 TES and 14 P-TES is conducted. Buffer radius service area in this analysis, are 450m, 900m, and 1350m. It means that the community who are in the circle will be able to reach shelter in time. As it is seen, the 15 shelters can accommodate refugees within a radius of 450m and 900m, and only few refuges can be accommodated within a radius of 1350m. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Empirical evidence is consistent with the model's predictions: Labor force participation rates of married women are negatively correlated with the metropolitan area commuting time. Also, metropolitan areas with larger increases in average commuting time in 1980-2000 had slower growth in the labor force participation of married women.

The hazards which can be experienced in the area are various, including earthquake, tsunami/meteo-tsunami, flooding, sea level rise (related to global warming, subsidence, coastal erosion, salt wedge intrusion), release of toxic substances from chemical plants, pollution, conservation of monuments and the impact of tourism. The resilience of the environment refers to key issues including ecology, economy, tourism and industry, society and the population, construction and infrastructure, cultural heritage. The paper includes a review of literature aiming at the definition of vulnerability and resilience. Reference is made to specific frameworks which are identified, with a special focus on MOVE - Methods for the improvement of vulnerability assessment in Europe presented as a conceptual framework for a holistic approach to disaster risk assessment and management. MOVE arose from the need to develop methods and indicators for improving vulnerability assessments to natural hazards in Europe, and established a consistent framework. In addition relevant experiences are analysed including the Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) for the North Adriatic Coast in Italy, the post-earthquake reconstruction plan for the Arsita Municipality (Abruzzo) in Italy and the UNISDR Program Making Cities Resilient. The approach for vulnerability analysis and overall system resilience for Venice and its territory needs to cover a wide spectrum and is complicated.

This study investigated the association of an objective school walkability index with AST and how this association is mediated by the perceived physical and social environment. 1250 Danish students aged 11-13 years completed a commuting diary and a questionnaire. The walkability index was constituted of measures of road connectivity, traffic exposure and residential density. AST's share in all school trips was 85.4% with little difference between genders. The school walkability index was significantly associated with AST (Medium vs. Low OR 2.68; High vs. Low OR 2.49). Adding the perceived physical and social environment variables improved the model prediction of AST, with no change in the association with the school walkability index. Furthermore, distance to school significantly moderated the association between the school walkability index and AST. This research confirms the association between the urban form surrounding schools and AST. Medium and highly walkable school sites in combination with a distance to school below 2 km, no speeding traffic and many paths in the neighborhood was associated with the highest odds ratio for AST.

Over the years, the existence, but especially the level of development of the financial markets became a barometer for the evolution degree of the market economy which compels us to proceed to a deep analysis for our study. Since the banks are still reluctant to resume financing the private sector, the development of the stock market has become an important aspect at a macroeconomic level, because some investments might be overtaken by the capital market. Unfortunately, for Romania, the concept of capital market is a relatively new. Even if the first stock market (Bucharest Stock Exchange) came into existence in 1882, it stopped working in 1941 because of the institution of the communist regime, which transformed it into a planned economy. A few decades after, in 1995 the stock market was reintroduced and it has been in a continuous development ever since but with large gaps compared to the big stock markets from the Western Europe. The year 2008 marks the listing of the first international companies at the Bucharest Stock Market. Through this study, we intend to identify the systemic barriers which once removed could create a modern capital market and can lead to transforming the Stock Market into an international institution.","[Diaconu, Ioana-Raluca; Aursulesei, Tudor Mugurel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,ioana.raluca.diaconu@gmail.com; Atmugur@gmail.com,"Aursulesei, Tudor Mugurel/AAE-4241-2022; Raluca, Diaconu Ioana/AAA-1464-2021","Aursulesei, Tudor Mugurel/0000-0001-6862-2066;",,,,,9,0,0,1,2,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-020-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,273,279,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346751900038,0

Addressing this question empirically is not straightforward as it requires a model that allows for discrete choices at the regional and international levels; the former nominates candidates while the latter ratifies them. Using an original multiple discrete choice model to analyze a dataset of 180 elections from 1970 to 2005, we find that UNSC election appears to derive from a compromise between the demands of populous countries to win election more frequently and a norm of giving each country its turn. We also find evidence that richer countries from the developing world win election more often, while involvement in warfare lowers election probability. By contrast, development aid does not predict election.","[Dreher, Axel] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Gould, Matthew] Univ Westminster, London W1R 8AL, England; [Rablen, Matthew D.] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Vreeland, James Raymond] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC USA",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Westminster; Brunel University; Georgetown University,"Dreher, A (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.",mail@axel-dreher.de,"Rablen, Matthew/Z-4674-2019; Gould, Matthew/AAT-6095-2020; Dreher, Axel/AAN-1839-2020; Vreeland, James Raymond/G-5539-2012","Rablen, Matthew/0000-0002-3521-096X; Dreher, Axel/0000-0002-7227-3599; Gould, Matthew/0000-0003-3927-0297; Vreeland, James Raymond/0000-0002-3429-8517",,,,,73,38,44,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2014,158.0,1-2,,,,,51,83,,10.1007/s11127-013-0096-4,0.0,,,33,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3FZ,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330979600009,0

To ensure continuous guaranteed compliance, compliance management should be considered during all phases of the business process lifecycle; from the analysis and design to deployment, monitoring and evaluation. This paper introduces an integrated business process compliance management framework that incorporates design-time verification and runtime monitoring approaches. The nutshell of the approach is the Compliance Request Language (CRL), which is a high-level pattern-based language for the abstract specification of compliance requirements. From CRL expressions, formal compliance rules can be automatically generated, thereby eliminating the need for business and compliance experts to learn and use complex low-level formal languages. Formalized compliance rules enable automated approaches to be used for the static verification and dynamic monitoring of business processes. An integrated prototypical tool-suite is developed as a proof-of-concept to help validating the applicability of the approaches, and validated by experiment with two real-life case studies.","[Elgammal, Amal] Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Giza, Egypt; [Sebahi, Samir; Hacid, Mohand-Said] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, LIRIS, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Turetken, Oktay] Tech Univ Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Papazoglou, Michael P.; van den Heuvel, Willem-Jan] Tilburg Univ, ERISS, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Eindhoven University of Technology; Tilburg University,"Elgammal, A (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Giza, Egypt.",a.elgammal@fcicu.edu.eg; samir.sebahi@liris.cnrs.fr; o.turetken@tue.nl; mohand-said.hacid@liris.cnrs.fr; m.p.papazoglou@uvt.nl; w.j.a.m.vdnheuvel@uvt.nl,"Turetken, Oktay/H-1667-2015; Turetken, Oktay/AAA-3441-2020; Elgammal, Amal/IZE-0192-2023","Turetken, Oktay/0000-0003-3798-0439; Papazoglou, Michael/0000-0002-2482-2282",,,,,36,3,3,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,764,781,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300082,0

Psychology acts as a frame for understanding not only human motivation but also interpersonal communication as a basic social need and as a basic means for satisfying other psychological needs.

Impulse response functions are also utilized to examine the signs of how one of these variables affects the other over time. One key empirical finding from the causality tests is that there is strengthening evidence of the nominal interest rate differential Granger causing the exchange rate as the wavelet time scale increases. When considering impulse responses on how the interest rate differential affects the exchange rate, there appears to be some evidence of more negative relationships at the shorter time scales (i.e. an increase in the Swedish interest rate compared to that of another country is associated with a lower Swedish krona price of the other country's currency) and more positive relationships at the longer time scales.

The authors compared two methods between using pure Genetic Algorithm (GA) and heuristic with GA with the tourist attraction nodes both inside and outside the town of Phuket area. The experimental finding indicates that using heuristic with GA gave a shorter distance than using pure GA, especially in terms of a high number of desired tourist attractions.

We advance the banking literature by stressing that the previous financing loosening is enhanced when there is similarity of lenders and borrowers along their ethical domain given that such similarity brings about familiarity and trust in non-opportunistic behavior between them, thereby contributing to lower information frictions. Unique data composed of 12,545 syndicated loan facilities from 19 countries for the period 2003-2007 indicate a 24.8% reduction in the mean spread associated with an increase of one standard deviation in the degree of borrowers' ethical behavior from its mean value. Such reduction is enhanced to 37.6% when lenders also behave in an ethical way.

Enterprises try to improve their performance and business value using available resources. We can observe the growing importance of intellectual resources as an effective tool for business performance and increasing competitiveness. Intellectual capital includes all intangible business resources that create profits and business value. These resources are usually divided into human capital, structural capital and relational capital of a company. Consequently, it is necessary to manage companies and their performance in a new way and methods which can be used in order to evaluate these assets. This paper is focused on business performance measurement and management in order to increase business performance and competitiveness. In the paper, the approach of Czech enterprises to performance measurement and management is discussed on the basis of the author's empirical research. This research was carried out among Czech enterprises in 2012. Because different results were expected depending on the size of the enterprise, respondents were categorized into small, medium-sized and large enterprises. Most Czech enterprises have already established measurement and management systems of business performance. The research showed that enterprises assess their performance mostly based on methods using financial variables and indicators. In this regard, the paper aims to present an overview about the importance of intellectual capital for business management and business performance measurement on the basis of relevant literature sources. Intellectual capital can be measured and evaluated by different indicators or methods. Most intellectual capital measurement methods are difficult to apply and some methods are not very precise. But a system of performance measurement and management that would reflect effects of all business resources needs to be created. Every enterprise should choose an approach and an evaluation method that will best correspond to their needs, goals and current situation.","Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Krechovská, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic.",mhorova@kfu.zcu.cz,"Krechovska, Michaela/C-5510-2016","Krechovska, Michaela/0000-0002-1215-1418",,,,,35,4,4,0,15,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,85,90,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000011,0

It also attempts to highlight the peculiarities in behaviour exhibited by Malaysian consumers when their complaints/ grievances have been sorted out. Based on phenomenological interviews conducted with the consumers, the complaint redressal process is discussed on the basis of their experiences in situations involving dissatisfaction arising from the usage of a product or service. The findings reveal that consumers in certain situations leave no stone unturned in gaining the support from different sources when they face a problem related to a product or service. They may also make use of different consumer associations/ forums for having their problems voiced and tackled through. However, as soon as their issue is sorted out by the concerned product/ service provider, they may just disappear without taking the pain to inform back the consumer associations which made all possible efforts to take forward the complaints with the concerned organization. In such situations, the consumer associations might have to face several difficulties and challenges which might further hamper their abilities, strengths and motivation to offer support to the aggrieved consumers in future.

Today, Hillside has blossomed into a steady exporter with a broad product line of fresh fruits and vegetables sold to buyers in the Middle East and Europe. Attainment of key quality certifications and a recent partnership with an NGO supporting SMEs to provide contracted growers with agricultural inputs has allowed Hillside's CEO, Eunice Mwongera, to scale up and establish new, bigger contracts with customers in Europe. The Middle East market offers smaller volumes but year-round opportunities, while orders for European markets are larger but are concentrated during certain months. Much bigger players in the horticultural export industry already serve the European markets-the question is whether Hillside can contend at the same level among those competitors. Eunice also is giving thought to Kenya's own domestic market.

It is generally accepted that students are the primary customers because they are involved in different roles: they are the product of the process, the internal customer for campus facilities, the labourers of the learning process and the internal customer of the delivery of the course material. So, it becomes necessary to identify the determinants of service quality from the stand point of students being the primary customer. Developing a service quality model to measure the student's perception on quality is a very complex and tedious task because the service quality dimensions cover many areas. Naturally, defining the dimensions of quality in higher education is based on the dimensions of service quality in other areas. Exploring quality in different areas, authors state different dimensions, i.e. they explore different aspects of users' satisfaction with some services. Different dimensions of service quality are used for different industries but there are some similarities between them. But, researchers agree that there is no single dimension which can be applicable for all the service sectors. In the literature, one can find different articles that deliver results of identifying dimensions of quality in higher education based on research conducted in different regions of the world, but literature is scarce when analyzing the research conducted in the area of B&H. This prompted the implementation of this research. Furthermore, each state has a specific educational system and it is necessary, to continuously explore and upgrade the models of service quality in higher education and its dimensions of quality. The aim was to offer students as many as possible statements about the quality of the educational process in order to be able to identify the relevant dimensions of service quality in higher education.","[Mabic, Mirela] Univ Mostar, Fac Econ, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Mostar,,mirela.mabic@tel.net.ba,"Mabić, Mirela/N-8720-2018","Mabić, Mirela/0000-0002-1529-7797",,,,,28,4,5,0,8,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,721,731,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000054,0

When assessing farm performance, it is appropriate to model these heterogeneous farm outputs separately. In this study, we use the distance function approach, which allows the consideration of technology with multiple outputs and multiple inputs. We compare estimates from single-output technology with estimates from multiple-output technology. Our empirical analysis is based on an unbalanced panel of dairy farms in the plain region of Switzerland for the period from 2003 to 2009. We choose the parametric estimation method and employ a translog specification of the production technology. The test of output separability favours a model that separately considers three different outputs: agricultural output; para-agricultural output; and direct payments. The separate modelling of direct payments has considerable influence on the estimated technology parameters as well as the technical efficiency scores. The consideration of direct payments as a separate output increases the elasticity of land by a factor greater than two and, accordingly, reduces the distance function elasticities of other inputs. The average technical efficiency estimates do not differ substantially when specifications differ. However, we reveal serious differences in the estimates of technical efficiency for individual farms. The estimated rank correlation coefficients show that the ranking of farms in terms of technical efficiency differs considerably when direct payments are modelled as a separate output.","[Mamardashvili, Phatima; Bokusheva, Raushan] ETH, IED, Agr Econ Grp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmid, Dierk] Res Stn Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Tanikon, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Mamardashvili, P (通讯作者)，ETH, Agr Econ Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",phatimam@ethz.ch,"Bokusheva, Raushan/ABB-1198-2020","Bokusheva, Raushan/0000-0002-3080-6270",Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The authors would like to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation for financial support.

This paper outlines the multi-criteria model for evaluation of cluster initiatives and explains its inner structure. Since there is a lack of case studies focused on evaluation of cluster initiatives, the model is consequently applied and a particular cluster located in the Czech Republic is evaluated. The results reveal that five main groups of indicators can be successfully applied in the realm of the ICT industry. The cluster itself is considered as functional in terms of communication and cooperation processes. However, attention paid to innovations seems to be the weakest point. (C) The Authors.

In the past, the poll tax was chiefly a fixed tax charge applied to an individual, irrespective of the latter's income, property and consumer expenditure. Similarly, the 'trading duty' is a fixed tax levy which runs contrary to modern perceptions of society as a whole regarding proportional and progressive taxation. Nowadays, a fair distribution of the tax burden must be characterized by both horizontal and vertical tax equality. The principles of universality of taxation, taxation equality, justice and certainty and the principle that no tax measures should be retroactive are embodied in the Greek Constitution. In Greece, the last three years have seen the approval of numerous tax laws, non-tax laws containing articles on tax provisions and Ministry of Finance decisions and decrees, while, in 2012, for the first time after many decades, all sectors of the economy are 'in the red'. Despite the gloomy financial environment in Greece, in fiscal year 2012 a type of poll tax was imposed as a 'trading duty' for traders who filed Natural Person Income Tax (NPIT) returns. The implementation of the 'trading duty' allows for an extension from the terms 'Operating Leverage' (OL) and 'Financial Leverage' (FL) to the term 'Tax Leverage' (TL). Thus, when a percentage change in Earnings Before Tax (EBT) translates into growth of Earnings After Tax (EAT), then the phenomenon of the magnifying effect may be called Tax Leverage (TL) and it will be due to the possible constancy of the tax burden (e.g. trading duty, poll tax). In this study, through a detailed example, financial results (Degrees of Operating, Financial and Tax Leverage) determined at different levels of sales volume exhibit similar financial characteristics. Statistically they show linearity and a strong correlation, which create reasonable grounds for introducing a new terminology in Finance. We consider it a given that OL is determined to a large extent by technology and can increase or decrease as a result of decisions relating to the investment budget. Furthermore, FL is positively related to the profitability of Assets, when EBIT/Assets>Borrowing Costs. Then, on the basis of the data and limitations of this study, TL is positively related to the profitability of Assets, when EBT/Assets>Tax Costs, while the Degree of Tax Leverage and the size of EAT are directly related accordingly. Lastly, a specific degree of combined leverage can be achieved through a different mix of OL, FL and TL, in order to offset any negative results that may arise from one of the three.

In fact, only poverty estimates (at the national and provincial level) since 2007 are based on the same methodological approach.

This concept of vulnerability implies a measure of risk associated with the physical, social and economic aspects and implications resulting from the system's ability to cope with the resulting event. Concepts of resilience take two broad forms, namely (1) Hard resilience : the direct strength of structures or institutions when placed under pressure. In the disaster context, resilience is often treated as the simple inverse of fragility. Engineers, for example, often refer to increasing the resilience of a structure through specific strengthening measures to reduce their probability of collapse with respect, for example, to earthquake intensities, wind loading or other physical stresses. As resilience increases, the degree of damage for a given intensity hazard decreases. (2) Soft resilience : the ability of systems to absorb and recover from the impact of disruptive events without fundamental changes in function or structure. While the old car or carriage built on rigid supports would certainly end up with some broken axles when driving along some bad roads, the modern car can easily absorb the same impacts with its suspension system (springs or hydraulic systems). Thus, people with direct access to capital, tools and equipment, and able-bodied members are the ones which are most resilient when a disaster strikes. This paper shows how soft or hard resilience may be introduced in a system after it is analysed to determine its vulnerability. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, an important challenge is to identify whether the effect of monetary policy has changed over time and for this purpose, a Dynamic Factor Model with time-varying parameters is estimated. The model is applied to Romanian economy, on a sample database consisting of 90 time series representing various macroeconomic variables. Monthly data, starting with 2000 and ending with 2013 are being used for the analysis. The reason for using a large dataset is to avoid issues such as omitting important information when considering a small set of variables. A much smaller number of Factors is extracted by using Principal Component Analysis and with these factors the TVP-FAVAR model is estimated. Time variation of the parameters allows for o comparative analysis of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in time. Once the impulse-response functions are estimated, several conclusions are to be drawn, such as: whether monetary policy actions have or do not have an impact over the evolution of the rest of the economy and whether the effect of these measures have changed over the years.","[Rosoiu, Andreea] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,andreea.rosoht@yahoo.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,2,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-020-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,384,390,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346751900054,0

It is the knowledge that drives life, is something that is present in the lives of people from all ages, for all that humanity has made up to today is the result of his knowledge. The developments in the business world, too, have its basis in knowledge. Organizations are to become, increasingly aware of the importance of knowledge, largely due to the changing environment and the ongoing process of globalization. Therefore, currently, taking into account the overall paradigm, successful companies are those that use knowledge as a key resource. This Case Study aims to determine whether Structural Capital is presented and valuated in a small company working in the logistics sector, and if it has an impact on the financial performance. Considering this, we have developed a Case Study that utilises a pragmatic and unique, holistic and exploratory approach. Data collection was carried out mainly through interviews and observation centred on Structural Capital and on the financial performance, conducted on two elements from different levels of authority and responsibility within the company, a director and an operation employee. A Likert scale of 5 points was used, and the study concluded that both participants interviewed, shared a similar point of view about Structural Capital and the financial performance. It was also concluded that the company evaluated is Structural Capital, in particular, the follow elements: the culture and the organizational characteristics had impact in the financial performance of a firm, and the company had a positive result over the years, although yields have stagnated recently, and expenses have increased due to the current international crisis. Consequently, it was concluded that in those companies, Structural Capital was valuated and the case study suggests that there is a relationship with financial performance.","[Santos-Rodrigues, Helena; Pereira-Rodrigues, Guiomar] Polytech Inst Viana do Castelo, Sch Technol & Management, Dept Econ & Business Sci, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal",Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo,"Santos-Rodrigues, H (通讯作者)，Polytech Inst Viana do Castelo, Sch Technol & Management, Dept Econ & Business Sci, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal.",hsantos@estg.ipvc.pt; guiomar@estg.ipvc.pt,"Santos-Rodrigues, Helena/A-8147-2012; santos-rodrigues, helena/M-7073-2019","Santos-Rodrigues, Helena/0000-0002-0442-4447; santos-rodrigues, helena/0000-0002-0442-4447",,,,,30,1,1,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,179,183,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000022,0

This study aims to analyze how individual learning approaches are applied in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany and which barriers and enablers result from this. As individual learning in organizations evolves into and contributes to group and organizational learning, this was considered while detecting factors that influence learning. This study is based on a qualitative research using semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted with employees of different hierarchical levels from SMEs in Germany to investigate their individual learning approaches as well as existing key barriers and enablers of learning in their change processes. A framework of key barriers and enablers adapted to the learning approaches of these SMEs was created. The findings indicate that these SMEs rather focus on facilitating enablers to learning than on eliminating barriers. Furthermore, they show how important it is for these SMEs in Germany to consider key barriers and enablers of learning and provide indications whether their effect on the change success is positive or negative. Practical implications of the most important key barriers and enablers are provided. Finally, suggestions for future research regarding how learning facilitates organizational change and what SMEs are required to do for that are made. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Then, the agents shape the knowledge bases from the servers to avoid asking the same question twice if the local agent does not know the answer. Further, it introduced the possibility for agents to cooperate, so that they can ask questions of each other if they are on the same server. Finally, priority queues were implemented on the servers, so that only a fixed maximum number of agents could be served at a time, in a descending order of priorities. (C) 2014 The Authors.

A few years later (1948), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN, according to which education was at last officially established as a human right for the first time throughout human history. Upon the end of WW II, the creation of International Institutions aiming principally at implementing policies towards economic development came to the fore. Given that collaboration is more effective if it takes place through multilateral institutions, the International Institutions gradually emerged as important regulators of the global scene, setting or influencing international developments at various levels. At the same time, the content of education, the structure of the educational system and the implemented education policies were regarded as key factors influencing economic growth. In this way, economy was directly related to education while education was in its turn directly linked to development programs. There are many international institutions intervening in education policy matters. The action taken by some of them is widely known while others' action is not, since the fields they get involved in are prima facie not related to education issues. The less known institutions include the IMF and, secondarily, the IBRD. The role of the IBRD is more active and visible while the involvement of the IMF is indirect, through its involvement in the financing procedures of the WB. The present paper will attempt to examine the role played by the IBRD and the IMF in cultivating and diffusing specific education policies and ideas as well as the value bases on which their education programs develop. The vast majority of the International Institutions dealing with education do not form a specific self-contained policy promoted by the member states themselves since they are not capable of enforcing specific measures. They usually define specific goals and create an attractive atmosphere around them. These goals are subsequently promoted through the mesh of relationships and partnerships they have been developing. The particularity of the Bretton Woods Institutions lies in their ability to impose specific measures on the states. While promoting their positions through financial programs, rendering their implementation an integral part of financing, they in fact enforce the implementation of specific education policies.

The results indicate that intercultural communication contexts and challenging issues facing Chinese employees, and the strategies used to cope with above challenges in the two types of MNCs, are different significantly. This paper further finds that the locations of the workplace (i.e. in home country or in host country), the phase of internationalization of the firms and the stage of intercultural sensitivity of Chinese employees result in above differences. Based on above results, this paper identifies two internal and three external intercultural communication contexts, and finds that the intercultural communication challenges in above contexts appear as the conflicting issues in business and management, but are caused by differences in interests, position and culture which are interweaved.

Using the sign restriction vector autoregression (VAR) approach during 2000-2012, our empirical results can be summarized as follows. First, both US financial and trade linkages exert a significant impact on production in Asian economies. Second, through both financial and trade linkages, US spillover shocks account for around 50% of the production fluctuation in Asian economies. Third, during the episodes of 2007-2009 US financial crisis, the impact of financial shocks is greater than that of trade shocks. Results suggest that (i) Asian economies are not decoupled with US; and (ii) different from conventional findings, financial linkages between US and Asian economies are strong, especially for highly developed Asian economies. Therefore, investors and policymakers of Asian economies should take account of US financial conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It is therefore important for policy makers to understand people's decisions on travel behavior and lives over a longer time period. However, little has been known about the interdependences between life domains, especially over the life course (i.e., biographical interdependences) in the context of residential and car ownership behavior. To fill this gap, this study aims to clarify households' biographical interdependences relating to residential and car ownership biographies by explicitly incorporating the influence of household structure and employment/education biographies. Biography is defined based on a general concept of mobility that indicates a change occurring in a life domain. For this purpose, a Web-based life history survey was conducted in November 2010 and 1000 households living in major Japanese cities provided valid data. Aggregate analysis and exhaustive CHAID analysis were carried out, focusing on the occurrence times of mobilities in each biography. Results confirm obvious two-way cause-effect relationships over the life course between residential and car ownership biographies that are further influenced by household structure and employment/education biographies. Especially, not only short-term but also long-term state dependence and future expectations within and across life domains are clarified. Household structure and employment/education biographies are found to be more influential on residential biography than car ownership biography. Though residential biography is seen to be more influential on car ownership biography, the other two biographies also play an important role in explaining the car ownership mobility decision. All these findings suggest the necessity of developing intra-domain and inter-domain biographical interdependence models with flexible structures that capture the influences, of state dependence and future expectations over different time scales in the life course in a unified framework.

CFOs believe that (i) above all, high-quality earnings are sustainable and repeatable; specific characteristics include consistent reporting choices, backing by actual cash flows, and absence of one-time items and long-term estimates; (ii) about 50% of earnings quality is driven by non-discretionary factors such as industry and macro-economic conditions; (iii) in any given period, about 20% of firms manage earnings to misrepresent economic performance, and for such firms 10% of EPS is typically managed; (iv) earnings manipulation is hard to unravel from the outside but peer comparisons and lack of correspondence between earnings and cash flows provide helpful red flags. In addition, CFOs disagree with current standard setting on a number of issues including the sheer number of promulgated rules, the top-down approach to rule-making, the neglect of the matching principle, and the emphasis on fair value accounting. They indicate that a rules-based culture makes the audit function centralized and mechanical, and hinders the development of audit professionals. A summary impression from our work is that CFOs view earnings quality as more of a single and unconditional characteristic, in contrast to current research where measures of earnings quality are strongly conditional on the decision setting. This CFO view is related to their idea of one number - a single earnings metric that shapes both their interactions with external stakeholders and internal decision-making. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, this measure is not always appropriate for detecting the presence and impact of active management strategies. Based on the conditional factor models literature, we introduce a Conditional Single Index model where the time-varying alpha and beta parameters depend only on the past history of the underlying portfolio returns and of the benchmark returns. The dynamics of the parameters have two components: the first describes the long-term behaviour of the alpha and beta, whereas the second is associated with the short-term performance of the underlying portfolio. The interpretation of parameters allows the identification of portfolio managers who implement active management strategies.

This paper proposes working simultaneously with different default severities, related to several past-due ranges, by means of transition matrices (to be named default matrices). In this way, default, as well as recovery, is depicted in a multidimensional flow, with the purpose of avoiding missing relevant information. The challenge lies on performing comparisons between default matrices, for which new metrics are proposed. In this paper, default matrices are built to measure consumer credit delinquency at four large Brazilian banks, allowing a detailed comparison of their credit migration experiences. The study is also able to draw relevant information from comparisons between estimations techniques (discrete and survival approaches) and between default criteria.

Previous literature has emphasized the entrenchment effect of classified boards. However, we find that this adverse impact of classified boards can be offset or even superseded by the potential benefits of board classification for firms who hope to benefit from the advisory services of their independent directors. We show that firms with greater advising needs appoint more outside directors with diverse attributes and expertise, qualifications that enhance the ability to provide useful advice to managers. Furthermore, in such firms, board classification is associated with higher performance sensitivity of forced CEO turnover and better acquisition performance. Conversely, in firms with high monitoring costs, board classification hurts managerial equity-based incentives and risk-taking incentives. These findings suggest how and through which channels classified boards engender the differential effects on firm value. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the burgeoning literature especially focuses on interbank and bank-firm credit networks. On the other hand, in developing countries, deferred check payments also compose another kind of credit networks and complement for the bank-firm credit lines. Check payments among SMEs even substitute for bank credits. Recent developments in Turkey offer an interesting setting in which we examine the fragility of check payment system. In this paper, we investigate whether the dramatic increase in nonpayments of checks have been due to the decline in growth or loosening of the legal sanctions. We analyze check payments using an agent based model. We can view check payments as a network structure where firms are nodes and check obligations are directed links. Firms' decision on whether paying their checks or not, depend on behavior of their neighbors and probable payoffs to their decisions. Our main finding is that lack of strict punishment can cause default cascades in check payment systems.","[Arslan, Ilker; Duman, Alper] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Arslan, I (通讯作者)，Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey.",ilkarslan@gmail.com; alper.duman@ieu.edu.tr,,"Duman, Alper/0000-0001-9928-6501",,,,,14,0,0,0,18,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Model specification errors result from the use of domestic environmental and domestic technology coefficients to estimate emissions or resources that are embodied in international trade. For footprints, unacceptably large overestimations arise from using domestic emission coefficients, which are only partly canceled out by using domestic technology coefficients. For water use footprints both specification errors are smaller, but hardly cancel out. Sectoral aggregation errors occur when combining the 129 EXIOPOL industries to 59 EU industries and 10 broad sectors. The latter aggregation creates the largest errors. Spatial aggregation errors arise from combining 43 individual EXIOPOL countries in four broad regions and the rest of the world.

In various polities, brokers have thrived in spite of the secret ballot, a surprising outcome given that vote secrecy would ostensibly allow citizens to pocket the inducements offered by such individuals and vote their consciences anyway. To address this puzzle, we develop a framework for understanding the persistence and demise of vote brokerage under the secret ballot. In our model, a broker contracts with voters using an outcome contingent contract: some fixed benefit is promised to all voters sharing one of several observable profiles should the broker's candidate win the election. Using this framework, we demonstrate that the existence of brokerage depends on the size of the electorate contained within the jurisdiction controlled by the broker, with large jurisdiction sizes tending to drive brokerage out of existence. Moreover, we detail the manner in which the strategies employed by brokers depend on their economic power, the size of social groups, and ideological polarization.

Using a unique hand-picked database of 990 VC-backed Belgian firms and a complete population of Belgian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we focus on the extent to which the presence of a VC investor affects the sensitivity of a firm's returns to the changes in the capital structure, in the operating cycle, and in the industry dynamics. The differences may stem from the (self-) selection of better companies into VC portfolios, from the venture capitalists' (VCs) value-adding activities, and/or from both. We examine these factors in the context of a complex simulation procedure which allows separating selection from value-adding when traditional approaches are difficult to implement. Our results indicate that VC-backed firms are able to extract more rent from the changing industry conditions and from the optimizations in their capital structure. The presence of VCs in the firm's equity seems to have only a marginal effect on the operating cycle efficiency. Overall, the results are suggestive of the value-adding being the main driver of the VC-backed firm's performance.","[Alperovych, Yan] EMLYON Business Sch, F-69134 Ecully, France; [Hubner, Georges] Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Hubner, Georges] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Hubner, Georges] Gambit Financial Solut, Liege, Belgium",emlyon business school; University of Liege; Maastricht University,"Alperovych, Y (通讯作者)，EMLYON Business Sch, 23 Ave Guy Collongue, F-69134 Ecully, France.",alperovych@em-lyon.com; g.hubner@ulg.ac.be,"Alperovych, Yan/AFM-5620-2022","Alperovych, Yan/0000-0001-7864-770X",,,,,53,12,14,2,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In particular, the top 10% of the stocks with the most recent 52-week high price outperform the bottom 10% of the stocks with most distant 52-week high price by 0.70% per month. Further, conditioning on the recency of 52-week high price significantly increases the profitability of momentum strategy based on the nearness of current price to the 52-week high price.

Commercial Paper Funding Facility program participation is consistently positive only for traditional banks and programs that focus on the purchase of specific securities (e.g., commercial paper) to address specific problems also appear to primarily benefit traditional banks.

For the U.S. an unanticipated increase in policy uncertainty has a significant negative effect on real stock returns. A positive oil-market specific demand shock (indicating greater concern about future oil supplies) significantly raises economic policy uncertainty and reduces real stock returns. The direct effects of oil shocks on real stock returns are amplified by endogenous policy uncertainty responses. Economic policy uncertainty and oil-market specific demand shock account for 19% and 12% of the long-run variability in real stock returns, respectively. As a robustness check, (domestic) economic policy uncertainty is shown to also significantly influence real stock returns in Europe and in energy-exporting Canada. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Based on a sample of around 60,000 SMEs, we come to the conclusion that, despite the stronger standards used by banks when granting credit, French SMEs do not appear to have been strongly affected by credit rationing since 2008. This result goes against the common view that SMEs suffered from a strong credit restriction during the crisis but is perfectly in line with the results of several surveys about the access to finance of SMEs recently conducted in France.

We interpret the results to imply that managers have reputational capital at risk in making corporate capital allocation decisions and that the level and tone of media attention heighten the impact of a value-reducing acquisition on the managers' reputational capital.

At short maturities, the non-default component is important in the first half of the sample period and is correlated with measures of funding and market liquidity.

Most formulations of MTSMs with p > 1 are shown to imply a much higher dimensional factor structure for yields than what is called for by historical data. In contrast, our asymmetric arbitrage-free MTSM gives modelers the flexibility to match historical lag distributions with p > 1 while maintaining a parsimonious factor representation of yields. Using our canonical family of MTSMs we revisit: (i) the impact of no-arbitrage restrictions on the joint distribution of bond yields and macro risks, comparing models with and without the restriction that macro risks are spanned by yield-curve information; and (ii) the identification of the policy parameters in Taylor-style monetary policy rules within MTSMs with macro risk factors and lags.","[Joslin, Scott] Univ S Carolina, Marshall Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Le, Anh] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Singleton, Kenneth J.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Singleton, Kenneth J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Singleton, KJ (通讯作者)，Knight Management Ctr, Stanford Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kenneths@stanford.edu,,,,,,,29,20,21,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Secondly, in those cases where the acquirers are mature and already have some international exposures.

To illustrate this point, we build an adaptive learning model, that extends existing learning models in monetary policy, most notably, Bullard and Mitra (2002).

Our quantitative estimates suggest that the former action when applied to all merchandise imports would address competitiveness and environmental concerns in high-income countries but with serious consequences for trading partners. For example, China's manufacturing exports would decline by one-fifth and those of all low- and middle-income countries by 15 %; the corresponding declines in real income would be 3.7 and 2.4 %.

While men still maintain a higher participation rate in paid work, the gap has diminished over time. Women's headway in the workforce is closely linked to the remarkable progress they have made in education. But women's advantage in education does not translate into the wages they receive. While, on average, the gender pay gap has diminished over the last 25 years, women continue to earn less than men, even among younger and better-educated generations. Why is this the case?

Instead of raising fuel taxes, Canada's provincial and federal governments prefer to subsidize the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles and the accelerated retirement of old vehicles. Are these programs effective? Can they be improved? We argue that subsidies for hybrids and electric vehicles are not cost-effective and instead recommend building on Canada's brief and modest experience with feebates. While British Columbia's pioneering accelerated vehicle retirement program is cost-effective, its success rests significantly on inducing participants to switch from personal vehicles to alternative transportation modes, Policy refinements will be needed to adapt the lessons learnt from this program to less favourable conditions elsewhere in Canada.","[Antweiler, Werner] Univ British Columbia, Sander Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Gulati, Sumeet] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Antweiler, W (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sander Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,"Antweiler, Werner/IYI-9261-2023","Antweiler, Werner/0000-0001-8526-378X",,,,,25,8,9,1,20,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We show that discrete barrier or lookback options can be approximately priced by their continuous counterparts' pricing formulae with a simple continuity correction. The correction is justified theoretically via extending the corrected diffusion method of Siegmund (1985). We also discuss the jump effects on the performance of this continuity correction method. Numerical results show that this continuity correction performs very well especially when the proportion of jump volatility to total volatility is small. Therefore, our method is sufficiently of use for most of time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Addressing these problems requires reliable and detailed information regarding the urban structure and its dynamics. Previous studies have tried to explore cellular networks data for urban analysis, yet little attention has been given in exploring mobility related events of cellular networks. This study uses handover, which is the process of transferring an ongoing call from one cell to the other, to capture urban dynamics. The handover data was collected from cellular towers in Lisbon, Portugal. First, our method started with a pre-processing of the handover data. Then, experiments were carried out to understand the city dynamics through GIS visualization and statistical analysis. The visualizations provided a qualitative explanation of how the movement of calls is useful in highlighting the flow of people in urban infrastructures. Using statistical analysis, two important relationships were proved: there is a significant association between cell towers with a high number of incoming handovers and a high presence of people in their vicinity; and a greater proximity to the main road links of cell towers characterized by a high number of incoming as well as outgoing handovers thus towers denoting more movement. Our results suggest that the handover information, taking the advantage of its pervasiveness, can provide ways to analyze city dynamics at a larger scale. This approach complements the effort of traditional urban data collection methods, which are usually made available less frequently to urban planners and policy makers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a new political economy model in which a union can endorse one of the candidates in a local election. A politician that prefers an inefficiently large public sector can, therefore, win an election if the union can provide sufficiently strong support during the campaign. We have assembled a unique data set that is based on union endorsements that are published in leading local newspapers. Our empirical analysis focuses on municipal elections in the 150 largest cities in the U.S. between 1990 and 2012.

Technical mechanisms have been considered for this advantage, such as learning and occupancy of preferred market segments. We argue that first movers may also benefit from a social identity advantage because being identified as the original in a market implies authenticity. When first-mover advantage is based on such an identity, market memory is important. Initially, audiences distinguish the originality of the first mover, but as time passes, such differences are less recognizable. We find evidence of this pattern--and that organizations are constrained from expanding beyond where their identity is established.

China's specific household structures - with co-residence of seniors, their adult children and grandchildren-are therefore expected to have huge implications on the travel outcomes of the household members. Based on the dataset of Nanjing Residents Travel Survey (2008), the paper attempts to reveal the impacts of the special household structures on travel behaviour of both seniors and young parents. The results indicate that the elderly co-resided with their adult children tend to make much fewer trips and travel shorter distances while spending less time on travel than seniors who live alone or as couples, especially for leisure trips. However, young parents in the 'extended family' are inclined to travel longer for commuting in terms of both distance and time, while they make fewer shopping trips, compared to young parents in 'core families'.

Surprisingly, in previous studies, the potential spatial spillover effect of transportation infrastructure on economic output in the U.S. agricultural sector has not been taken into account given the sector's importance in the economy and dependence on transportation. The broader effects, including the direct effect and spatial spillover effect, of transportation infrastructure on agricultural output across 44 states in the United States from 1981 to 2004 are estimated in this study. A spatial Durbin panel data model that catches spatial dependence in both dependent and explanatory variables is used. The results suggest that road disbursement in a given state has positive direct effects on its own agricultural output. Also, the spillover effect of road infrastructure on agricultural output in neighboring states varies with respect to the spatial weight matrix used in the model. Moreover, our analysis shows that enhancement in road infrastructure in the states in the U.S. central region has a larger positive spillover effect on agricultural output when compared to coastal or border states.

However, empirical studies have so far failed to find conclusive evidence for this so-called pollution haven or race to the bottom effect where foreign direct investment (FDI) is assumed to be attracted to low regulation countries, regions or states. In this paper we present a simple theoretical framework to demonstrate that greater stringency in environmental standards can lead to a strategic increase in capital inflows which we refer to as environmental regulation induced FDI. Our result reveals a possible explanation for the mixed results in the empirical literature and provides an illustration of the conditions under which environmental regulations in the host country can affect the location decision of foreign firms.","[Elliott, Robert J.

We focus on the domestic aviation sector of two comparative cases - Australia and Brazil - each of which represents a large continental country with contrasting levels of policy volatility. We apply generalized entropy indices to measure the changing spatiality of air transport seat capacity over a 25-year period (1986-2010). We find evidence of a correlation between air transport policy volatility and spatiality. Using the generalized entropy indices, the study finds that the spatial evolution of Brazilian air transport capacity is governed by variations among very large airports, which are often subject to policy and regulatory intervention. In contrast, the distributional pattern of Australian airports was relatively stable and characterized by gradual and consolidative changes. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Koo, Tay T.

Previous literature finds a negative relationship between bank independence and deficits in OECD countries. No such relationship is found for developing countries. We argue that independent and conservative central bankers prefer budget discipline due to the long run connection between deficits and inflation and can enforce their preference through interest rate hikes and refusal to lend to the government. The claim, however, is that the legislated independent status of the central bank is cheap talk in the absence of democratic institutions. We test empirically the conditional effect of central bank independence on a sample of 23 democratic and undemocratic post-communist countries from 1990 to 2002. Results show that independent central banks restrain budget deficits only in democracies. Also, democracies that have not granted independence to their central banks have the worst fiscal discipline.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Bodea, C (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bodeaana@msu.edu,,,,,,,77,26,28,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2013,155.0,1-2,,,,,81,107,,10.1007/s11127-011-9843-6,0.0,,,27,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,095RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315352800005,0

We make use of the change in the Index of Economic Freedom as a measure of market liberalizing reforms, employing data from a panel of 117 countries for the period from 1981-2006.

The results are robust in relation to sample size, alternative data and methods, and a sample of only developing countries; and they are substantively quite large.

This paper focuses on the European case and investigates how the LCA spatial strategy has evolved since the last available comprehensive analysis in 2004. Using comprehensive data, the analysis is conducted at three levels: global, cities and networks. It shows that LCAs now represent 31% of intra-European airline seats. Although LCA business has expanded to Central-East Europe, Morocco, and a few remote areas, it remains mainly focused on the intra-Western market. In general, LCAs serve large cities and tourist destinations. The use of secondary, regional airports is put into perspective. Service volatility is low at the city level but significant at the inter-city level. Average distance has increased, but most flights are short-haul. LCAs play an important role in launching new routes, thus diversifying the European airline-network, and in increasing frontal competition with traditional airlines on pre-existing routes. The niche markets are common in terms of routes but are rather limited in terms of seats supplied. Actually, the main specificity of the largest LCAs is the provision of flights that do not serve the home country. A typology of networks demonstrates that there is no a single European low-cost model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we show that investors are reluctant to hold foreign equity with a tax levied by a foreign tax collector. Starting point is the observation that willingness to pay taxes depends on the attributes of the tax collecting country. This relationship indicates a form of country-specific tax behavior: taxpayers respond to country attributes as they indicate cooperative and trustworthy behavior of tax authorities, the government or other taxpayers. We conduct a laboratory investment experiment to explore the effect of sentiment towards different tax collectors, specifically of the view on home country taxation relative to foreign country taxation. The results suggest that investors prefer domestic equity and invest in riskier portfolios in case of a foreign tax rather than a domestic tax on foreign dividend income. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using contract-level loan data for nonfinancial firms in the US, this study provides evidence that the occurrence of a covenant violation significantly increases the likelihood of a dividend reduction in the subsequent quarter. Moreover, we show that the degree of creditor-shareholder conflict and firm financial constraints are important determinants of dividend cuts upon technical default. Additionally, this paper finds the tendency of dividend cuts upon technical default weakened after the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. These findings suggest that loan covenants serve a critical role in mitigating creditor-shareholder conflicts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First, we focus on the dependence structure using copulas. To select the best copula, in addition to the goodness of fit tests, we employ a graphical method based on visual comparison of the fitted copula density and the smoothed copula density estimated by wavelets. Moreover, we check the stability of the copula parameter. The empirical results show that the long memory affects the dependence structure. Second, we analyze the impact of this dependence structure on the optimal portfolio. We propose a new approach based on minimizing the Conditional Value at Risk and assuming that the dependence structure is modeled by the copula parameter. The empirical results show that our approach outperforms the traditional minimizing variance approach, where the dependence structure is represented by the linear correlation coefficient.

Our scientific contribution has been misleading because our models are structurally incapable of addressing major concerns. The cost-benefit test is not fit to assess large-scale resource conservation projects, including climate abatement. This understanding was already present during the Rio '92 summit, but the problems, while identified, have not been resolved twenty years later. The contribution from theory, through the sustainability paradigm of non-decreasing welfare, has turned out ineffective. It does not provide us with tools for designing a better future for our children. Instead, it risks choosing a constant welfare path, with knowledge increasing but natural resources deteriorating, while not properly analyzing the richer possibilities for a better future that nature and creativity imply.

By analyzing 15 independent experimental asset markets with a total of 171 participants, we find that differences in BAS and BIS sensitivity affect trading in both 'normal' and shock-trading environments: under normal trading conditions, individuals with a more sensitive BAS are more active traders, prefer riskier portfolios, and generate higher individual overall profits. High BIS subjects generate lower scalping and overall profits. Fundamental shocks generally reinforce the preference of high BAS investors for riskier portfolios, while positive shocks 'unfreeze' high BIS investors: they trade more frequently and generate higher profits. At the market level, normal trading in markets with a high BIS median is associated with lower volatility, compared to low BIS median markets, while greater concentration of traders' BAS scores around the mean is associated with better efficiency and liquidity, compared to markets with lower BAS kurtosis. In high BIS median markets, positive shocks lead to improved efficiency, lower bid-ask spread, and lower volatility. We observe no significant differences in market-level reactions to negative shocks. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

After creditors observe what occurs in a rollover game for a firm, they conjecture one another's type or attitude toward the risk associated with the firm's investment project. Creditors' inference about one another's type then influences their decision to lend to the next firm. By providing an analysis of the incidence of failure (the threshold for a liquidity crisis) for each firm, this paper demonstrates that the risk of contagion increases sharply if it originates ex ante from a firm facing a low probability of failure. In addition, the paper proposes some policy measures for mitigating the severity of contagion during a liquidity crisis. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The framework begins with the choice between on-farm and off-farm investments and ends with the selection of activities that decision-makers believe would be more effective in addressing their needs. The paper tests this thesis using data collected from participants in an agritourism workshop in Kansas. The test begins at the framework's second stage, where decision-makers decide between intensifying current operations to take advantage of scale and/or size economies, and diversifying to deploy slack resources in other businesses. The third stage involves the selection of alternative enterprises to meet decision-makers' desired objectives. It is hypothesized that the second stage decision choice is defined by decision-makers' demographic characteristics and their motivational factors. Demographic characteristics, such as age and education, also serve as proxies for decision-makers' embedded capabilities. The results show that for this case study, all demographic characteristics but gender are statistically significant, with education exhibiting the highest positive impact on the decision to diversify at the second stage. Economics was also determined to be a positive motivating factor in the intention to choose marketing, tourism and fishing and hunting enterprises at the third stage. However, personal satisfaction was a positive motivating factor for all enterprises except fishing and hunting. The impact of community as a motivation for any of these enterprises was split. It was negative for marketing and positive for accommodation and food service and statistically insignificant for tourism and fishing and hunting. The study provides an empirical foundation for exploring the diversification decision process and choices among smallholder producers as well as challenging policymakers to carefully determine how these decisions and choices actually get made given people's situations and characteristics.","Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Amanor-Boadu, V (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 306 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",vincent@ksu.edu,"Amanor-Boadu, Vincent/A-8278-2011; Amanor-Boadu, Vincent/GPF-7293-2022","Amanor-Boadu, Vincent/0000-0002-4226-7489;",,,,,36,22,28,0,36,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

When application is distributed across several clouds with varied interest, infrastructure, policy, etc, the issue therefore will be how to determine the most cost effective cloud during access time. The amount of money a student pays in accessing learning content is determined by how much an institution pay as subscription to cloud providers. The objective of this study is to utilize optimization theory to determine the most cost effective cloud for mobile virtual education in Sky Computing environment. This will be achieved by optimizing resource usage for Computer-based Education through Mobile, Speech and Sky Computing Technology.

Using a novel model of banking, this article argues that the high profits were achieved through balance sheet expansion and growing default, liquidity, and term risk mismatches between assets and liabilities. As a result, large banks' financial leverage rose as they became less liquid, setting the conditions for a systemic banking crisis. This article argues that the increase in financial leverage was possible due to misguided changes in the regulatory framework, specifically, the Basel I capital accord and reductions in reserve requirements.

Authors of the paper in cooperation with leading experts from energy sector carried out a unique qualitative and quantitative research focused on energy mix of the Czech Republic. The research based on multi-criteria decision-making analysis aimed to optimize the energy mix. The analysis was prepared using the Delphi method and Operations Research methods. In the research framework eight technological variants of energy production were analyzed considering available energy sources in the Czech Republic. Variants were assessed on basis of selected sets of criteria including both benefit and risk criteria. The Weighted Sum Approach method was used for multi-criteria evaluation of the particular variants. Further the Fuller's method was used to estimate the weights of single criteria. The resulting effect was determined as the difference between the benefits and the risks each option occurs. The overall evaluation regarding all variants was carried out by assessment of benefits, risks and resulting effects set for each variant.","[Cerny, Igor; Magnuskova, Jana; Krcmarska, Lucie; Spakovska, Katerina] Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,209,216,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400028,0

In order to survive in these conditions, companies should learn new knowledge in a short period of time and apply to their business. Although it cloud be achieved through self-educated employees, there are some drawbacks such as having not standard languages and process which could improve performance of organizations. To solve these problems, the companies need internal education system aligned with mission and business strategy. But, many companies just run on-the-job training in specific filed like engineering or marketing. This paper analyzes education strategy and system of Crotonville in GE, Advanced technology training institute in Samsung, and Toyota institute that are famous for internal training, and then tries to find implications for education managers.

Proponents of this new risk-taking channel of monetary policy have argued that the low interestrate environment in the run-up to the crisis may have created incentives for banks to take on excessive leverage and lower their lending standard, thus weakening bank portfolios. There is growing empirical evidence supporting this view. In contrast, this link has been little studied from a theoretical standpoint, leaving somewhat of a hole in our understanding of why (and how) banks' decisions concerning the overall risk of their portfolios, and their capital structures, may be influenced by changes in the interest rate environment and, by extension, policy choices (e.g., monetary policy) that affect it. We summarize some of the emerging literature on this topic (both empirical and theoretical), as well as some of the more classical work on related topics. We also present a simple model that illustrates various channels through which bank risk-taking is affected by the interest rate environment in which banks operate. We use that model to analyze the likely effect of various other forces. Given the wealth of evidence that interest rates may have a real effect through banks' portfolio decisions, it is important for policymakers to better understand the channel through which real interest rates operate on banks' decision-making.","[Dell'Ariccia, Giovanni] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Dell'Ariccia, Giovanni] Ctr Econ & Policy Res, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Marquez, Robert] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA",International Monetary Fund; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of California System; University of California Davis,"Dell'Ariccia, G (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",gdellariccia@imf.org; rsmarquez@ucdavis.edu,"Marquez, Robert/C-4963-2017",,,,,,47,15,15,2,53,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4805-2,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Low inference measures were mainly used to measure classroom climate, and now the dominating methods are high inference measures, which measure subjective experience of teachers and students from their perception. However, the high inference measurement methods lack objectivity, dynamic nature, practicality and operability and it is difficult to take account of individual difference meanwhile and study the interaction of the factors that affect classroom climate and the internal mechanism of dynamically changeable climate. The agent-based modeling can make up for the deficiency, which could be used to model agents' activities, probe into the interaction of subjects and objects and monitor the dynamically change of the system. This helps explore a new way to measure the classroom climate. During the period of primary school, middle school and even university, students spend most of the time in the classroom. Positive classroom climate not only improves students' performance and interpersonal relationship, but also enhances their psychological health. The curriculum reform in china explicitly required the teachers to create a positive classroom climate that is beneficial to the students' integrated development. Therefore, the number of the classroom climate research has soared since 1990. If classroom environment and classroom climate are indexed in the CNKI(Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), 265,485 and 421,104 papers respectively can be searched; the number has increased every year since 2003 and since the beginning of 2013, there has been 16,170 papers published in China. However, literatures of classroom climate in china are mostly theoretical and speculative, and the measurement methods used in the few empirical studies are similar to those used in the foreign research, most of which are quantitative research. Now, the curriculum reform is promoted so fast that it poses new challenges to the measurement method of classroom climate, so it is essential to review the previous literature, summarize the advantages of the studies and propose new measurement methods, for instance, agent-based modeling, a method of the emerging complex science, which can cover the shortage, keep pace of the technological innovation and provide some operable strategies for creating favorable classroom climate.","[Dong, Zhe; Liu, Haiyan] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Beijing,,liuhy@cugb.edu.cn,,,,,,,30,0,0,2,12,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-139-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,353,360,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA7HH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337529900059,0

We begin with a brief discussion of the theoretical and historical antecedents to the SO2 trading program. We then describe the events that led to the program's effective end in 2011. We argue that the SO2 trading program had two key vulnerabilities: SO2 emissions cause multiple environmental impacts, some with local consequences, and internal conflicts within the Clean Air Act. Because of these vulnerabilities, in the end, the program was unsustainable.

Based on the results of a study undertaken on this topic, the paper calls into attention that communication is a key-competency required for the specialists of 21st century, and emphasizes the necesity of including specialty courses in educational programs of these managers.","[Irimie, Sabin-Ioan] Univ POLITEHN Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara,,nibas8511@yahoo.com,"Irimie, Sabin/AAB-4732-2021",,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,709,716,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100077,0

The behaviour of the local search method, which is a special case of the more general threshold accepting algorithm, is determined by the function which is used for obtaining the next (neighbour) solution candidate and the performance of the threshold accepting algorithm is further influenced by the threshold values. Both these simple trajectory based methods can be easily implemented and the results of the experiments suggest that the algorithms perform well.","[Kasprikova, Nikola] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Math, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,nb33@tulipany.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,570,577,,,,,,8,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100058,0

The used data sample covers the time period 2006-2011 which contains the development during the last global economic crisis. The development is compared before the crisis, during and after the crisis, respectively the reaction of businesses to the crisis. The metallurgical industry and automotive industry represent two selected industry branches which have been chosen because of their significant cyclical character. Although these two industry branches are significantly cyclical industries they are different in the proportion of the consumed inputs. This contribution identifies and analyzes the value productivity which reflects the level and changes in the technical and economic efficiency of production factors. The value productivity is an important factor in achieving the corporate performance. The value productivity is used in the contemporary concept which works not only with the efficiency of inputs consumption but also with the efficiency of employed capital (inputs binding). The advantage of this approach can be detected that counted and analysed indicators are not described as static but we are able to dynamize the analysis.","[Klecka, Jiri] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Business Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,jiri.klecka@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,7,7,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,611,620,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100062,0

Classic models of organization management, primarily as a result of globalization and the increasing turbulence of environment, receding into the background and in their place are trying to force a new, modern organization management, using modern management tools. One of these tools is also project management. The organization has always been, is and will be able to successfully implement their projects, but it is important to remember that good project management is not easy, and this fact gave birth to the project management as a separate discipline. Project management in the corporate significance represents a set of recommendations based on best practices of other organizations in managing and coping with complex problems. The result of these recommendations is a number of comprehensive methodologies, which differ mainly in place of establishment or treatment, but their basic philosophy is most often identical and differ only point of view. Important components and characteristics of each project is the risk. Each project is unique and is associated with the uncertainty that accompanies projects. This uncertainty may generate risks in projects. Risk management is a key area of project management. In projects is not discussing only about one risk, but about many risks. Each project has more risks, and to increase the probability of project success, it is appropriate to manage risks in projects. In the Czech Republic is not common yet the using of risk management in projects, this fact emerges from reality, that there is great awareness and understanding of the issues of risk management. The aim of this paper is explaining the importance of the issue of risk management in projects and also describes the basic risk management techniques applicable in projects. The main contribution of the paper is comparison of different methods of risk management of the project and description the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Risks are part of each project, and when we found out that the project is not risky, it would not make sense to implement the project. Risks accompany the project in all its phases of the life cycle. In the pre-project stage there is analysed the risks, in project phase the risks are monitored and in the post-project phase the risk sis evaluated. The project team should keep this fact in mind and should not in any stage omit the project risks. Number of risk in any project is different, only the fact that the amount of risk increases in proportion to the duration of the project, or the longer the time between pre-project and project phases and based on the lack of experience of the implementers. The methods that are described and compared in this article are the following: the method RIPRAN, scoring method with map of risks, sensitivity analysis method, FRAP method, tree analysis and scenario planning method. In this article is these methods described, explained and compared.","[Obrova, Vladena; Smolikova, Lenka] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Informat, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,obrova@fbm.vutbr.cz; smolikova@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,5,3,3,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1496,1503,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100160,0

The main aim of this work is to give recommendations to develop the tourism, depending on the individual potentiality of each median city of the interior of Andalusia and the set of them. But many times having the tourist potential does not imply necessarily its development; to develop the tourist industry successfully is necessary to establish bows of collaboration among the public sector, private sector and the citizenship in general. However, not all the medians cities can obtain an important tourist development. It depends on the reach of its regional policy with the lower cost of its public's resources. For that we have elaborated a synthetic index of tourist potentiality for medians cities of the interior of Andalusia, besides we will study the present situation of the management of the tourism in these regions.

One of the major challenges that current Grid systems are facing is the low resource utilization, resulting from the lack of suitable tools and mechanisms that understand the language of distributed applications. An effective utilization of resources depends on a better resource provisioning mechanism. The selection of resources in a Grid system involves finding and locating resources based on user requirements. Moreover, the performance of a Grid primarily depends on successful resource provisioning through scheduling and allocating resources according to users requirements. In this paper, we present a sub-domain ontology-based resource provisioning mechanism to increase the utilization of resources. We further extend the model to understand the characteristics of Grid entities in an economic system's point of view. We evaluate the significance of using dynamic pricing over static pricing to deal with the dynamic nature of the Grid. The results show improved success probability and system's profit compared to the traditional resource provisioning mechanisms.","[Shaikh, Abdul Khalique; Haque, Aminul] Monash Univ, Sch IT, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia; [Alhashmi, Saadat M.] Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Engn & Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Parthiban, Rajendran] Monash Univ, Sch Engn, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Abu Dhabi University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Shaikh, AK (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Sch IT, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.",shaikh@monash.edu; aminul.haque@monash.edu; saadat.alhashmi@adu.ac.ae; rajendran.parthiban@monash.edu,"Parthiban, R/A-4999-2008; Khalique, Dr Shaikh/AAV-1208-2021","Parthiban, R/0000-0003-0983-9796; Alhashmi, Saadat M./0000-0003-4044-9315",,,,,31,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,266,+,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200028,0

Biological stock assessment models are more sophisticated with regard to biological content, but rarely account for economic objectives. This study includes a full age-structured population model for studying schooling fisheries and extends the delayed difference approach used in earlier studies. We take the total harvest as the choice variable, resulting in a simple analytical structure. The model produces optimal steady states that may be higher or lower compared to the delayed-difference formulation. The model is applied to the Baltic sprat fishery. Both ecological and harvesting cost data support specifying Baltic sprat as a schooling fishery. Given nonlinear harvesting costs, the optimal solution is a path toward a steady state with smooth annual harvest and population age structure. Sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal solution is highly dependent on the population level of the sprat's main predator Baltic cod. A linear cost function and an interest rate below 9 % imply pulse fishing instead of smooth continuous harvesting. Given nonlinear harvesting cost, the optimal steady state yield is rather insensitive to changes in the interest rate. However, under a high cod scenario, interest rates of 10 % or higher implies that no optimal steady state exists.","[Tahvonen, Olli] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Quaas, Martin Friedrich; Schmidt, Joern Oliver; Voss, Rudi] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Helsinki; University of Kiel,"Tahvonen, O (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Latokartanonkaari 7,PL 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",olli.Tahvonen@helsinki.fi,"Schmidt, Jörn Oliver/A-7714-2008; Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012; Voss, Rudi/A-6113-2011","Schmidt, Jörn Oliver/0000-0002-4420-6532; Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829; Voss, Rudi/0000-0002-4299-8791",,,,,36,40,41,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Further, it is aimed at investigating the impact of such activities on the land market, agricultural structures and regional development. Four regional case studies are carried out, three of them in the New Lander (former GDR). In each case study region, structured interviews were conducted with about ten farm managers and ten regional experts. Results show that the group of 'non-agricultural investors' is very heterogeneous and cannot be delimited by clear indicators. Thus, the core question about the relevance of their activities can only be answered with respect to the type of investor.

Efficient diversification of investments is achieved by inputing robust pair-copulas based estimates of the expected return and covariances in the mean-variance analysis of Markowitz. Although the whole point of diversifying a portfolio is to avoid rebalancing, very often one needs to rebalance to restore the portfolio to its original balance or target. But when and why to rebalance is a critical issue, and this paper investigates several managers' strategies to keep the allocations optimal. Findings for an emerging market target return and minimum risk investments are highly significant and convincing. Although the best strategy depends on the investor risk profile, it is empirically shown that the proposed robust portfolios always outperform the classical versions based on the sample estimates, yielding higher gains in the long run and requiring a smaller number of updates. We found that the pair-copulas based robust minimum risk portfolio monitored by a manager which checks its composition twice a year provides the best long run investment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The present study explores the effects of these two policies on the number of building permits issued across 83 municipalities in northern New Jersey. The empirical work is based on a widely-used urban development model that uses both monocentric and polycentric factors to allocate growth across a set of suburban communities. The study also develops a growth-based test for binding minimum-lot-size zoning, leveraging the fact that the 83 communities are in a single housing market and must serve the distribution of home and lot-size demand collectively, not individually. The study finds strong evidence of excess large-lot zoning, leading to the suppression of short-term housing growth in communities that specialize in this particular product. No firm evidence is found that residential development is attracted to the amenities that flow from either large-lot zoning or open space set asides. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We have three treatments with different levels of deposit insurance which reflect the losses a depositor may incur in the case of a bank run. We find that different levels of deposit insurance and the possibility of observing other depositors actions affect the likelihood of bank runs. When decisions are not observable, higher levels of deposit insurance decrease the probability of bank runs. When decisions are observable, this need not to be the case.

Amid heightened concern about environmental damage and climate change, public appeals for cooperation and pecuniary incentives are frequently used to achieve resource conservation and other prosocial behavior. Yet the relative effectiveness of these two instruments is poorly understood when pecuniary incentives are small. This paper examines the extent to which free transit fares and appeals for car trip avoidance reduce car pollution on smoggy days. Using data on freeway traffic volumes and transit ridership, public appeals for cooperation are shown to have no significant effect on car trip demand. Free transit fares, however, do have a significant effect on car trip demand. But the effect is perverse in that it generates an increase in car trips and related pollution. Free fares also increase transit ridership. These results suggest that free transit rides do not induce motorists to substitute to transit, but instead subsidize regular transit rides and additional trips. Appeals for cooperation have no affect on carpooling behavior.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Sexton, SE (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 4312 Nelson Hall,Box 8109, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",sesexton@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,41,6,9,3,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

It involves a societal restructuration that affects power relations, multi-level governance structures, the (re)spatialization of juridical legitimacy and symbolic boundaries between sociocultural groups (ethnicity). This paper analyses the consequences of the major Bolivian agrarian reforms of 1953, 1996 and 2006 for the current process of setting up the plurinational state under the government of Evo Morales. Using a historical and sociopolitical approach, we show that the ethnically differentiated devolution of individual and collective tenure rights has resulted in an institutional segmentation along ethnic boundaries that gives rise to a growing polarization between the two socially constructed categories of indigenous people and peasants. This institutional segmentation is not limited to agrarian questions but also affects other domains, such as political processes related to territorial autonomies. The current government is trying to maintain a neutral position by giving priority to large-scale national programmes of economic development.","[Bottazzi, Patrick] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Rist, Stephan] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern,"Bottazzi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",patrick.bottazzi@cde.unibe.ch; stephan.rist@cde.unibe.ch,,"Bottazzi, Patrick/0000-0002-0431-802X",,,,,55,36,42,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The asymmetric effect of additions and deletions on informational efficiency can be attributed, at least partly, to certain aspects of liquidity and other fundamental characteristics, which improve following additions but do not diminish after deletions.

I elicit risk attitudes in the financial and environmental domains using multiple-price list experiment. I examine how subjects' behavioral, attitudinal, and demographic characteristics affect their probability weighting functions first for financial risks, then for oil-spill risks. I find that most subjects tend to overweight extreme positive outcomes relative to expected utility in both the environmental and financial domains. Subjects are more likely to overemphasize low probability, extreme environmental outcomes than low probability, extreme financial outcomes, leading subjects to offer more support for mitigating environmental gambles than financial gambles with the same odds and equivalent outcomes.

Market expectations around the RBA decision are derived explicitly from 30-Day Interbank futures. The first trade following the RBA decision occurs after 220 s on average, and after 234 s (1.73 trades) the market has adjusted to the theoretical settlement price. Deviations from theoretical prices post-announcement are common, particularly when a large amount of uncertainty exists around the RBA decision.

Bridge projects also have considerably smaller cost overruns - 7% in the Netherlands compared with 45% in other NW European countries and 27% in other geographical areas. In explaining cost overruns, geography should therefore clearly be taken into consideration. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Cantarelli, C.

It asks whether there is an optimal structure and whether this differs between different firm environments and between young and older firms. We find that the influences on the ability to innovate differ from those on the commercialisation of innovations. We show that decentralised decision-making, supported by a formal structure and written plans, supports the ability to innovate in most circumstances and is superior to other structures. We also find some evidence that young firms operating in high technology sectors with informal structures have a greater tendency to be innovative. In addition, we find very few differences between young and older firms in terms of their optimal structures in low technology sectors.","[Cosh, Andy] Univ Cambridge Queens Coll, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB3 9ET, England; [Fu, Xiaolan] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Hughes, Alan] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University of Cambridge; University of Oxford; University of Cambridge,"Cosh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge Queens Coll, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB3 9ET, England.",adc1@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,57,69,4,97,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Results converge to suggest that rather than focusing solely on banking sector size, financial policy should seek to foster inter banks competition, develop appropriate macro-prudential safeguards, promote capital market development.

Applying the framework to four stocks traded at the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in 2002, we show that the suggested model captures the spatial and temporal dependencies of the limit order book. We find spill-over effects between both sides of the market and provide evidence for short-term quote predictability. Relating the shape of the curves to variables reflecting the current state of the market, we show that the recent liquidity demand has the strongest impact. In an extensive forecasting analysis we show that the model is successful in forecasting the liquidity supply over various time horizons during a trading day.

In the wake of the crisis, several researchers and institutions-both private sector and central bank-developed measures of financial stress. These measures are intended to capture, among other things, the liquidity in financial markets and potentially forecast changes in real economic conditions. Unfortunately, there is no agreement about which variables should be included in a measure of stress. The authors survey a number of financial stress indexes, comparing the datasets from which they are constructed. In principle, each of the indexes measures the same thing; thus, they should be highly correlated. The authors find that in practice, however, the correlations are high but not as high as might be expected. They also evaluate the ability of the indexes to predict future economic activity in a simple vector autoregressive forecasting model.","[Kliesen, Kevin L.; Owyang, Michael T.; Vermann, E.

The deterministic analysis by Homans and Wilen (J Environ Econ Manag 32:1-21, 1997) and Anderson (Ann Oper Res 94:231-257, 2000) is thus extended to a stochastic scenario where the resource cannot be measured accurately. The resulting model is solved numerically to find the optimal control rules in the Iberian sardine stock. Three relevant conclusions can be highlighted from simulations: first, the greater the uncertainty regarding the state of the stock, the lower the probability of the fishery being closed before the end of the fishing period. Second, the use of TACs as a management instrument in fisheries that are already regulated by fishing periods leads to: (i) an increase in the optimal season length and harvests, especially for medium and high numbers of licences; (ii) improved biological and economic variables when the fleet is large; and (iii) extinction risk for the resource being eliminated. Third, the regulator would rather select the number of licences than restrict the season length.","[Maria Da Rocha, Jose] Univ Vigo, RGEA, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Maria Da Rocha, Jose] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain; [Jose Gutierrez, Maria] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, FAEII, Bilbao 48105, Spain; [Jose Gutierrez, Maria] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, MacLab, Bilbao 48105, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Da Rocha, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, RGEA, Vigo 36310, Spain.",jmrocha@uvigo.es; mariajose.gutierrez@chu.es,"Gutiérrez, María-José/C-1141-2009; Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/CAJ-5410-2022; Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/Y-7181-2018","Gutiérrez, María-José/0000-0003-3074-0854; Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/0000-0003-3985-8816",,,,,23,10,11,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Here, we estimate the impact of climate change on food security in Tanzania. Representative climate projections are used in calibrated crop models to predict crop yield changes for 110 districts in Tanzania. These results are in turn imposed on a highly disaggregated, recursive dynamic economy-wide model of Tanzania. We find that, relative to a no-climate-change baseline and considering domestic agricultural production as the channel of impact, food security in Tanzania appears likely to deteriorate as a consequence of climate change. The analysis points to a high degree of diversity of outcomes (including some favorable outcomes) across climate scenarios, sectors, and regions. Noteworthy differences in impacts across households are also present both by region and by income category.","[Arndt, Channing] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Farmer, William; Strzepek, Kenneth] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Thurlow, James] UNU WIDER, FI-00160 Helsinki, Finland",University of Copenhagen; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Arndt, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",channing.arndt@econ.ku.dk,"Thurlow, James/JQW-4545-2023; Farmer, William/M-4481-2015","Farmer, William/0000-0002-2865-2196; Thurlow, James/0000-0003-3414-374X",,,,,34,43,48,3,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Japan, and the US during 1989-2006 of manufactured products in which China specializes. It finds that imports from middle income countries are in close price competition with those from China and that there has been price competition between China and high-income countries in low-technology products. By contrast, the impact of China's exports on low-income countries is not through price competition but through market expansion. China's WTO entry had a once-for-all shock on the export prices of the high-income countries. The price competition effect of China's exports weakened over the time period of 1989-2006, suggesting a gradual change in competition from price to nonprice factors such as quality and variety. If sustained, this trajectory poses an increasing competitive threat to high-income economies in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Transaction costs have caused implementation to lag. This paper examines transaction costs and institutional performance in environmental water allocation. It evaluates spatial and temporal performance trends in watershed cases along three dimensions of adaptive efficiency: water recovery, transaction costs, and program budgets. Performance trends demonstrate intrastate variability and volatility over time due to the importance of local institutional capacity, which is uneven within states. Higher levels of water recovery may coincide with moderate to high transaction costs and program budgets, particularly during initial implementation efforts.

Using options- and press-based proxies for CEO overconfidence, we find that over the 19932003 period, firms with overconfident CEOs have greater return volatility, invest more in innovation, obtain more patents and patent citations, and achieve greater innovative success for given research and development expenditures. However, overconfident managers achieve greater innovation only in innovative industries.

The model is a variation of the quasi-hyperbolic discounting model. Based on the distinction between 'wanting' and 'liking', the paper presents one possible explanation of impulsive choices of smaller sooner rewards instead of larger later ones. These impulsive choices are induced by cues that trigger strong motivational 'wanting' to obtain smaller sooner rewards, but do not necessarily influence the degree to which the rewards are 'liked'. Cue-triggered 'wanting' can occur when an individual is in a specific need deprivation state, perceives a cue previously associated with an immediately obtainable reward, knows that the cued reward can reduce the current deprivation state, and lacks self-control. Attributable to the integration of cue-triggered 'wanting' into an intertemporal choice model, the incentive salience can account for anomalies in intertemporal choice such as present-biased preferences and the domain effect.

Assessments of trustworthiness are based on the ability, benevolence and integrity of the owner manager. The study examines whether lending managers' assessments of the trustworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) owner managers are associated with the interest rate charged. Data were obtained from a survey of lending managers from small banks in North East Italy. Control variables and a vector of trustworthiness factors were collected on a random sample of customers, resulting in data for 365 small firms (74% response rate). Multivariate regression analyses provided evidence of a negative association between trustworthiness and interest rates. Banks, owner managers, policy makers and researchers should recognise the potential of trust to influence lending decisions and behaviour.","[Howorth, Carole] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Moro, Andrea] Open Univ, Sch Business, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Lancaster University; Open University - UK,"Howorth, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",c.howorth@lancaster.ac.uk,"Howorth, Carole/C-3327-2013","Howorth, Carole/0000-0002-5547-687X; Moro, Andrea/0000-0002-2012-3548",,,,,62,49,54,1,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Although the literature on offshoring has flourished, the research regarding inshoring is limited. This paper examines inshoring on both empirical and theoretical fronts. Empirically, it shows that business support services have been increasingly sent to small localities for cost savings while being separated from their downstream industries, which have been consistently concentrated in large cities. Guided by empirical findings, a system of cities model is formulated to analyze inshoring and its welfare impact. The analysis shows that support workers are made better off, primarily because inshoring allows support workers to benefit from higher urban productivity without bearing urban costs.

How does firm entry regulation influence the performance of long-living entrants? In this paper, I address these questions, exploiting a natural experiment in firm entry regulation. After German reunification, East and West Germany faced different economic conditions, but fell under the same law that imposes a substantial mandatory standard on entrepreneurs who want to start a legally independent firm in one of the regulated occupations. The empirical results suggest that the entry regulation suppresses long-living entrants, not only entrants in general or transient, short-lived entrants. This effect on the number of long-living entrants is not accompanied by a counteracting effect on the performance of long-living entrants, as measured by firm size several years after entry.","Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Prantl, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",prantl@coll.mpg.de,"Prantl, Susanne/GWC-7361-2022",,,,,,48,10,11,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

For example, 15 states currently have laws that restrict wine sales in grocery stores. Several of these states have proposed changes that would expand the distribution of wine; however, the proposals have met significant resistance from key stakeholders and none have resulted in legislation. It is widely expected that additional proposals will be initiated, but with more attention given to mechanisms that would address some of the transitional issues. A simulation model is developed here to assess the likely economic effects of introducing wine into grocery stores in New York State. Results indicate that tax revenue would increase by $22 million annually, revenue for in-state wineries would increase by approximately 13%, and revenue for liquor store owners is calculated to fall by 28%. Simulation results are subsequently used to develop a framework for evaluating the transitional costs of policy reform in this highly regulated industry.

Using a unique dataset of intraday data consisting of 2.3 million block buys and 1.9 million block sales, we find an asymmetry in the price impact of block purchases and sales. The asymmetry persists even when we account for the bid-ask bias in block trades, which is contrary to the previous literature. Overall, our findings suggest that in an emerging market where institutional trading is relatively scarce, market microstructure cannot explain the asymmetry in the price impact of large trades.

We find that labor reallocations and wage shifts attributable to liberalization account for at most 29% of the increase in inequality between 1993 and 2004, and that the effects of services reforms are many times larger than those of trade liberalization. In contrast, 30-66% of the increase in wage inequality is due to changes in industry wages and skill premiums that cannot be empirically linked to liberalization. These results suggest that if liberalization did, in fact, contribute significantly to increased inequality, the bulk of its effects do not linger in inter-industry wage and skill premiums but are subsumed by general equilibrium effects. Studies of the liberalization-inequality relationship that focus on differences in employment and wage outcomes across industries, or on tradable goods alone, may therefore only be exploring the tip of the iceberg.

Although an intuitive response is to ban lending to such regimes, this paper shows that if a government faces endogenous replacement risk, then an international odious debt doctrine which (i) decreases the country's debt ceiling; (ii) decreases the likelihood that the citizens must repay the debt; or (iii) increases the government's cost of borrowing for a given default risk can all decrease citizens' welfare.

Using two surveys conducted before and after the election we find that one out of three Kenyans was affected by the violence regardless of their ethnicity and wealth. The chances of being a victim of violence were higher in areas with land conflicts and where politically-connected gangs operated. Violence, which was mainly triggered by the perception that the election had been rigged, increased support toward lawlessness, reduced trust and social capital among communities.

We find that short sellers more heavily trade ADRs from countries where short selling is prohibited than from markets where short selling is allowed. Furthermore, we find that the greater levels of short selling in ADRs with binding home-market constraints is driven by stocks with greater dispersion of investors' opinion, low fundamentals-to-price ratios, and recent price increases. Our results support the hypothesis that short sellers target ADRs with home market short-sale constraints because these ADRs are more often subject to temporary misvaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the non-bankrupt strategic alliance partners, on average, experience a negative stock price reaction around their partner firm's bankruptcy filing announcement. This negative effect is strongest for longer partnerships and those with higher returns at the announcement of the initial alliance formation. Furthermore, horizontal alliance firms in declining industries have lower returns, indicating that industry conditions can exacerbate expected problems for the non-bankrupt firm. Non-bankrupt partners also experience drops in profit margins and investment levels in the subsequent two years with the worst performance concentrated among the longer-term agreements. There is very little impact on the returns or performance for joint venture partners, which suggests that these agreements are more insulating for the partner firm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For example, HARP homeowners must service the entire principal balance and meet additional eligibility restrictions that are not warranted by economic considerations. In contrast, the 60/40 Plan provides for affordable monthly payments by restructuring the debt into two parts, has relatively minor eligibility requirements, and creates household incentives to maintain the property. Failure to address the current financing needs of the housing market may result in a decapitalization of the banking sector, lost potential house value for many homeowners through foreclosure, and an extended episode of low growth for the U.S. economy.

Constraints in rural transport infrastructure and services are often compounded by limitations in the development and resilience of technological infrastructures. In this context there is significant disparity between urban and rural communities. This paper will examine the context for accessibility and connectivity in rural communities highlighting key transport and technology challenges. It also explores barriers and opportunities to bringing together transport and technology solutions to enhance rural accessibility and connectivity. This is an area where current understanding is weak as most research has been focussed on urban environments. The paper focuses specifically on two issues of current research: firstly, the role of information and associated technologies in supporting rural passengers on public transport, secondly, the use of technologies to support flexible and demand responsive transport services in rural areas.

The arrival of an invasive species is modeled as an irreversible event with an uncertain arrival time. The model is solved in two stages, beginning with the post-invasion stage. Once the arrival occurs, the optimal path of species removal is that which minimizes the present value of damage and removal costs plus the expected present value of prevention costs. An expenditure-dependent, conditional hazard rate describing species arrival is developed based on discussions with natural resource managers. We solve for the optimal sequence of prevention expenditures, given the minimum invasion penalty as just described. For the case of the Brown Tree Snake potentially invading Hawaii, we find that pre-invasion expenditures on prevention are inverse U-shaped in the hazard rate. Efficient prevention should be approximately $2.9 million today and held constant until invasion. Once invasion occurs, optimal prevention requires $3.1 million annually and $1.6 million per year on species removal to keep the population at its steady state level, due to high search costs at very small population levels.","[Burnett, Kimberly] Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Pongkijvorasin, Sittidaj] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Roumasset, James] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; Chulalongkorn University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Burnett, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, 2424 Maile Way,Saunders Hall 540, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kburnett@hawaii.edu,"Burnett, Kimberly/CAF-0517-2022",,,,,,34,11,13,2,92,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In particular, this study shows that (1) the small-firm effect is significant only for firms whose market capitalization is below their industry average; (2) the BM effect is an intra-industry phenomenon; (3) a one-year momentum effect is significant only for firms whose BM ratio is smaller than the industry average and limited to non-January months; and (4) there is seasonality in all effects that cannot be explained by risk-based asset-pricing models.

Values and personality traits are considered less likely to explain the utility difference between self-employed and salaried workers. Psychology scholars suggest that entrepreneurial satisfaction also depends, at least in part, on specific values and personality traits. Utilising a large dataset derived from the 2006 European Social Survey, this study performs a complementary analysis by taking personality traits, personal values and indicators for workers' autonomy explicitly into account. The empirical findings add further strength to economists' argument that, net of values and personality traits, autonomy and independence are the mechanisms by which self-employment leads to higher levels of job satisfaction. These results hold true for both male and female sub-samples even when a multitude of socio-demographic characteristics, personal values and personality traits are controlled for.","Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Lange, T (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",tlange@bournemouth.ac.uk,,"Lange, Thomas/0000-0003-2088-7430",,,,,51,134,155,5,114,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The lifecycle hypothesis indicates younger households should own more debt-related financial products, whereas households in intermediate lifecycle stages should own more financial products to accumulate assets; both these claims are disconfirmed for all groups. However, White households in intermediate household stages own more financial products than younger and older households, consistent with previously reported lifecycle findings in Western countries. Consistent with the literature on innovation adoption we find that younger, affluent and highly educated households amongst the other three ethnic groups tend to own more financial products than older Africans, Coloureds and Asians.

Although consumer value lies at the core of value chain management principles, none of these projects adopts a consumer perspective. This is an example of a more widespread gap in both the literature and practice as to how consumer perspectives can be used in the development of agrifood value chains in developing countries. This paper addresses this gap by surveying consumers of tomatoes in Nepal, segmenting them using cluster analysis and demonstrating how consumer segmentation can provide strategic direction for value chain development. The research identifies four distinct segments of tomato consumers in Kathmandu. The high value consumer segment, which is also the largest segment, places most importance on credence-based attributes that cannot be ensured unless a whole-chain effort is employed, indicating that developing value chains would be necessary if this need is to be met, and that such effort would pay off. An analysis of existing supply chains shows discrepancies between consumer expectations and the delivery of value, suggesting improvement opportunities to develop these chains.","[Adhikari, Rajendra Prasad; Collins, Ray; Sun, Ximing] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton 4343, Australia",University of Queensland,"Adhikari, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton 4343, Australia.",rajendra.adhikari@uqconnect.edu.au; ray.collins@uq.edu.au; x.sun@uq.edu.au,"Adhikari, Rajendra/ACX-1764-2022; Adhikari, Rajendra/P-2079-2015","Adhikari, Rajendra/0000-0002-1426-0570",,,,,41,13,14,0,9,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

This article analyzes the capacity of partnerships to promote sustainable change in global agrifood chains from a governance and a development perspective. The global coffee, cotton, and cocoa chains serve as main fields of application. From a governance perspective, the emergence of partnerships is largely positive inasmuch as partnerships act as initiators and agents of change which, although still mostly confined to niche markets, unfolds a chain-wide governance effect. From a development perspective, partnerships can be viewed critically as their top-down and business-driven nature leads to uncertain benefits for producers and results in the marginalization of certain development concerns. These differing conclusions can be explained by the fact that partnerships largely embody the neoliberal agenda, which raises specific questions, particularly from a development perspective.","Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Bitzer, V (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, Hollandseweg1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",verena.bitzer@wur.nl,,,,,,,79,41,47,0,24,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Countries with higher national incomes usually improve in both dimensions, but not always at the same rate. Using quantile regression, we show that poverty rates tend to decline with increased income at a roughly constant elasticity. In contrast, while the prevalence of child wasting declines at that same elasticity where it is most widespread, the elasticity becomes smaller as wasting becomes less prevalent. This finding suggests a greater need for increasingly targeted interventions to achieve a given reduction in undernutrition as its prevalence declines.","[Block, Steven A.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA USA; [Masters, William A.] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Bhagowalia, Priya] Ambedkar Univ, Sch Liberal Studies Undergrad Studies, Delhi, India",Tufts University; Tufts University; Ambedkar University Delhi,"Masters, WA (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr, Dept Food Policy & Appl Nutr, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",william.masters@tufts.edu,"Masters, William A./A-4796-2017","Masters, William A./0000-0002-4546-7291",,,,,24,7,8,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The Czech Republic and the Convergence goal of cohesion policy were chosen as a case study. Four themes are discussed in this regard. First, the spatial distribution of funds is analyzed with respect to the disparity goal of regional policy. Second, the coherence of regional policy on different regional levels is evaluated. Third, the differences in evaluations based on the seat of applicants on one hand and place of realization on the other are discussed. Finally, some thematic issues are considered. Our findings point at some ambivalent conclusions with respect to both, the disparity goal and the coherence of regional policy on different regional levels. In addition, the differences in the both forms of evaluations are emphasized.","[Hajek, Oldrich; Novosak, Jiri; Zahradnik, Petr; Bednar, Pavel] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Hájek, O (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",hajek@fame.utb.cz,"Bednář, Pavel/H-6607-2012; Novosák, Jiří/H-6493-2012; Hájek, Oldřich/H-6464-2012","Bednář, Pavel/0000-0003-1250-5762;",,,,,35,15,15,0,24,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The success of the stabilization programs based on exchange rates, the pegged exchange rate arrangements brake up in some emerging countries, the current difficulties in the Euro zone show why this topic is still controversial and important. We used OLS and GMM methods to estimate a growth model with dummy variables that isolate the effect of exchange rate regimes on economic growth. The research has been employed on 16 Central and Eastern European countries, where the exchange rate arrangement choice is a key point in the years before Euro adoption. We got statistically significant coefficients for the regime dummy variables, independently of the estimation method. Our results suggest superior effect on economic growth of the floating and intermediate regimes comparing to the fixed arrangements. Although the exchange rate stability is commonly viewed as stimulation for economic growth, it seems that it doesn't support growth if it was obtained by massive interventions of the monetary authorities to support the exchange rate level. Our surprising result does not explain why a major part of the selected countries adopted hard pegs, although the flexible regimes apparently stimulate growth. It is possible that currency boards are not suitable for long periods of time, but just for a quick economic stabilization. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Through a household survey supplemented by informal interviews, this study attempts to understand the dynamics of livestock predation by carnivores at village level in Botswana. The study reveals that farmers perceive hyenas and lions to cause more livestock losses than other predators. In order to reduce predation, attempts should be made to put livestock in enclosures at night and also to herd them during the day. These practices comply with the conditions of the new government compensation policy for livestock losses caused by carnivores. The study recommends a review of the compensation rates and suggests that they should be closer to the market value. Such changes, accompanied by strict animal husbandry practices, may bring about the increased willingness of households to co-exist with predators.","[Kgathi, Donald L.; Mmopelwa, Gagoitseope; Mosepele, Ketlhatlogile] Univ Botswana, Okavango Res Inst, Maun, Botswana; [Mashabe, Baitshephi] Univ Botswana, Dept Stat, Gaborone, Botswana",University of Botswana; University of Botswana,"Kgathi, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Botswana, Okavango Res Inst, Private Bag 285, Maun, Botswana.",dlkgathi@mopipi.ub.bw; gmmopelwa@orc.ub.bw; b_mashabe@yahoo.com; kmosepele@orc.ub.bw,,"mosepele, ketlhatlogile/0000-0001-5600-9221",University of Botswana,University of Botswana,"This study would not have been possible without the financial support of the University of Botswana.

Additionally, knowledge management is considered to be a strong support for innovation. Managing knowledge for innovation is a difficult issue for organizations, because innovative knowledge is implicit and hard to capture from minds. To make this knowledge explicit, we must use supportive technologies. In this article, we focus on intra networking - a type of social networking as a tool for managing knowledge for innovation in organizations. Intra networking is known as intranet in business and technological society. We define intranet as an internal or private network of an organization based on Internet technology (such as hypertext and TCP/IP protocols) and accessed over the Internet. An intranet is meant for the exclusive use of the organization and its associates (customers, employees, members, suppliers, etc.) and is protected from unauthorized access with security systems such as firewalls. It creates a meeting point for sharing knowledge for its users. We use a case study of a communication company to show intra networking as an effective supportive technology for knowledge management.

Secondly, and interestingly, consumer preferences seem to be driving the home bias in the wine sector. In contrast, the home bias in beer is widely attributable to the home market effect, namely firms tend to localize near the consumers in order to minimize the high trade costs associated with beer exports.","[Olper, Alessandro; Curzi, Daniele; Frisio, Dario Gianfranco; Raimondi, Valentina] Univ Milan, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Olper, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",alessandro.olper@unimi.it,"Frisio, Dario/GON-7376-2022; RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/AGY-1199-2022","Frisio, Dario/0000-0002-9856-3463; Curzi, Daniele/0000-0002-1596-5126; RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/0000-0002-5431-7885",,,,,35,4,4,0,10,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Since bio-ethanol is mainly produced from food crops such as sugar cane and corn, the increase in the demand for these food crops for ethanol production particularly by emerging markets such as china has imposed enormous pressure on demand for food and food prices. This study investigates the impact of increase in food prices on global economic growth; using food producer price and consumer price index as a proxy, this study examines the gain on the producer side and the loss on consumer side from this increase in food prices and how this gain and loss has impact economic growth. Descriptive analysis and bare bone Solow growth model was use in this study on data from 126 different countries, between year 2000 and 2009 for which data is available and during which there has been increase in food prices to achieve its goal. The result from our findings shows that the increase in food prices; has can be observed from the increase in food producer prices, has a positive impact on economic growth, signifying that the increase in food prices has some benefit on current global economic position. Also, our findings shows that consumer price index has a positive but insignificant relationship with economic growth; implying that the current increase in food consumer price index is not detrimental to global economic growth as one would expect instead there has been global benefit from the hike in food price.

This may seem to suggest that some European economies have been suffering from a debt overhang problem during the period under investigation. The results indicate that when debt reaches about 90% of GDP (a turning point), it serves as a bottleneck for future growth. In this regard, the results are quite robust, regardless of the types of explanatory variables included in the regression.

Using a difference in differences identification strategy, it finds the following results. First, the PSI programme significantly increased Math and English reading test scores among Grade 4 students, but not first language (Sinhalese or Tamil) test scores. However, PSI has had no effect on any test scores of Grade 8 students. In contrast, the SRCP had no significant impacts on any test scores in either grade, and further inquiries revealed that the SRCP was never really implemented. Second, the paper examined the impact of both programmes on teacher and school principal variables. Overall, few effects were found, and in some cases effects were found that one would associate with reduced school quality. On a more positive note, the PSI programme does appear to have led schools to form School Development Committees (SDCs), as the programme stipulates, to establish a list of school priorities and to implement projects funded through local fundraising.","[Aturupane, Harsha] World Bank, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Glewwe, Paul; Ravina, Renato] Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Sonnadara, Upul] Univ Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Wisniewski, Suzanne] Univ St Thomas, St Paul, MN USA",The World Bank; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Colombo; University of St Thomas Minnesota,"Glewwe, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",pglewwe@umn.edu,"Sonnadara, Upul/E-6359-2010; Sonnadara, Upul/Y-3042-2019","Sonnadara, Upul/0000-0001-7862-2537; Sonnadara, Upul/0000-0001-7862-2537",,,,,15,4,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This paper provides a novel explanation. Internal crises arise because of the inability to liquidate private debtors when many default. In an optimal contract, a successful entrepreneur repays yet an unsuccessful one defaults and liquidates his assets. The bounds on liquidation generate, however, a second equilibrium where domestic borrowers default because others are also defaulting. During these coordinated defaults tax collections fall which increases sovereign default risk. In the model joint debt crises are an optimal response to informational problems in private-sector lending.

On average, it takes 6 months to get approved for a residential building permit and another 2-4 quarters to complete a construction project. We present a simple two-sector model that incorporates these observations and show that the effect of these delays is not uniform: while they amplify the response of house prices to demand shocks, they dampen the effects of housing supply shocks. Moreover, construction activity depends on the relative duration of the shocks and the construction delays: delays dampen construction booms following temporary shocks, but exaggerate building activity following permanent changes in demand or supply conditions. Our results highlight the importance of capturing the nature and the persistence of the shocks when studying the effects of construction sector delays on housing market dynamics.

For the parliament elected in 2009, I show that indeed opposition party MPs who expect to face a close race in their district show significantly and relevantly lower absence rates in parliament beforehand. MPs of governing parties seem not to react significantly to electoral competition. These results are confirmed by an analysis of the parliament elected in 2005, by,several robustness checks, and also by employing an instrumental variable strategy exploiting convenient peculiarities of the German electoral system.

However, there is little evidence of the factors explaining spiteful behavior in children. We investigate the relationship between children's cognitive skills and spiteful behavior in a sample of 214 preschoolers aged 5-6 and their mothers. Here, other-regarding behavior in children is elicited through four simple allocation decisions. A key advantage of our study is that we have information about children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills as well as maternal and household characteristics. We find that higher cognitive skills are associated with more spiteful behavior in children. This relationship is even more pronounced among boys. Moreover, we find further gender differences that depend on the measure of cognitive skills and the degree of spite displayed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we extend the literature on risk allocation games by incorporating liquidity considerations. A liquidity policy specifies state-dependent liquidity requirements that a portfolio should obey. To comply with the liquidity policy, a financial entity may have to liquidate part of its assets, which is costly. The definition of a risk allocation game under liquidity constraints is not straightforward, since the presence of a liquidity policy leads to externalities. We argue that the standard worst case approach should not be used here and present an alternative definition. We show that the resulting class of transferable utility games coincides with the class of totally balanced games. It follows from our results that also when taking liquidity considerations into account there is always a stable way to allocate risk. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, when directly asked on surveys, respondents are likely to underreport their evasion behavior. Such invalid responses not only bias prevalence estimates but may also obscure associations with individual predictors. To generate more valid estimates of tax evasion, we used a new method of data collection for sensitive questions, the crosswise model (CM). The CM is conceptually based on the randomized response technique (RRT), but due to its advanced design, it is better suited for large surveys than classical RRTs. In an experimental online survey, we compared the CM (N = 862) to standard direct questioning (DQ; N = 305). First, our results showed that the CM was able to elicit a higher proportion of self-stigmatizing reports of tax evasion by increasing privacy in the data collection process. Second, on average, we found stronger effects of our predictor variables on tax evasion in the CM condition compared with the DQ condition such that an egoistic personality and the opportunity for tax evasion predicted actual tax evasion only in the CM condition.

Examining 100,593 sale transactions of apartment units in 205 residential developments completed between 1998 and 2010, we find strong evidence that their selling price and appreciation rate are related significantly to construction quality of the new homes. Moreover, the quality premium is present in both the primary and secondary markets.

This study simultaneously considers two effects of debt originating from agency theory the takeover defense and the disciplinary effects of debt on the speed of adjustment to the optimal capital structure. Corporate governance has a distinct effect on the speed of capital structure adjustment: weak governance firms that are underlevered tend to adjust slowly to the optimal capital structure, because the costs of the disciplinary role of debt outweigh the benefits of using debt as a takeover defense tool. Although overlevered weak governance firms also adjust slowly, they do so because they are reluctant to decrease their leverage toward the target level to deter potential raiders, especially if they face a serious takeover threat. Therefore, this study finds that both overlevered and underlevered firms with weak governance adjust slowly toward their target debt levels, though with different motivations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on fixed-effect panel regressions on a sample of 81 European stocks, we show that implicit transaction costs are better characterized by using specific Japanese candlesticks patterns. Although market timing costs are not lower when Hammer-like and Doji configurations occur, market impact costs are significantly lower when and after a Doji structure occurs. We further check the potential gains through order submission simulations and find that submission strategies based on the occurrence of Doji result in significantly lower market impact cost than random submission strategies.

In order to do so, we combine individual and firm-level data for Britain aggregated at the Travel-to-Work Area level. We find that a higher incidence of self-employment positively and strongly correlates with business creation and innovation in urban areas, but not in rural areas. We also document that more rural than urban workers become self-employed in areas with comparably poor labour market opportunities, although this heterogeneity is not evident when focussing on entrepreneurship. Finally, we show that the misalignment between self-employment and our proxies for entrepreneurship in rural areas disappears once we account for local labour market conditions. Our results suggest that self-employment, business creation and innovation are well lined-up in urban areas because they capture the same economic phenomenon - namely, genuine entrepreneurship.

By building an agent-based model, our aim is to explicitly consider the complex nature of credit markets as strongly interactive and evolving structures that can be suitably depicted by networks. In this type of setting, the nodes of a graph represent banks/firms and links represent the relationship between lending and borrowing agents. Since both loans and bad debts proceed through credit linkages, we analyze how market connectivity in particular the interbank one affects agents' performances, bankruptcy cascades and business cycle fluctuations. Specifically, interbank linkages allow banks to share credit risk but at the same time they can spread one bank's crisis through the whole network. Ultimately, the goal of our model is to analyze how microscopic interaction feeds back on macro stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

For those Euro-zone countries that built up large Euro-denominated external liabilities, Latin America's experience is particularly relevant and worrisome. Still, Europe may be in a better position to navigate a path out of the crisis given cooperative mechanisms that were absent in Latin America, particularly the availability of massive liquidity support. Nonetheless, while such support buys time, it does not guarantee success.

The growth elasticity of poverty since 2002 is estimated to have been -2.46, which means that a 10% increase in average consumption per capita would have reduced the poverty rate by almost 25%. However, we also find that rising income inequality negated a quarter to a third of the 5.7-percentage-point reduction in the headcount poverty rate.

Controlling for municipal fixed effects and candidates' characteristics, we find that expected closeness significantly increases turnout, thus supporting the idea that the expected benefits of voting increase in tighter political races.

Using a combined model for dispatch, transmission, and investment, three different investment options are considered, including gas-fired power plants, pumped hydro storage, and transmission lines. We find that geographically optimized power plant investments dominate in the reference scenarios for 2024 and 2034 In scenarios with decreased renewable curtailment, storage and transmission requirements significantly increase. In an alternative scenario with larger investments into storage, system costs are only slightly higher compared to the reference; thus, considering potential system values of pumped hydro storage facilities that are not included in the optimization, a moderate expansion of storage capacities appears to be a no-regret strategy from a system perspective. Additional transmission and storage investments may not only foster renewable integration, but also increase the utilization of emission-intensive plants. A comparison of results for 2024 and 2034 indicates that this is only a temporary effect.

Based on this model, we present empirical evidence on the link between corporate governance and risk taking, considering insurers from two large European insurance markets. Higher levels of compensation, increased monitoring (more independent boards with more meetings), and more blockholders are associated with lower risk taking.

Without competition, even a motivated MFI may lend to the not-so-poor in preference to poor borrowers. If double-dipping is feasible, competition may encourage lending to the poor. The presence of double-dipping is critical for MFI competition to have a positive effect. When double-dipping is feasible, MFI coordination may worsen borrower targeting whenever inequality is intermediate.

The paper finds that syndicated lending was an alternative to bilateral loans when banks were targeting growth or looking to utilize potential capital surpluses. Syndicated lending was also used to improve the returns and credit quality of the bank's loan portfolios. However, in the post crisis period, European banks are less interested in syndicated loan markets and larger banks, especially, those with strong capital bases, are refraining from syndicated lending.

Analyses focusing on 36,550 students who applied in 2007 indicate that SYEP produces small increases in attendance in the following school year, with larger increases for students who may be at greater educational risk: those aged 16 and older with low baseline school attendance. For this group, SYEP also increases the likelihood of attempting and passing statewide high school math and English examinations.

It is therefore striking that one of the most utilised economic models of tax compliance (Allingham and Sandmo, 1972) lacks this property as random audit selection is not a best response for the tax administration. The game theory literature of tax compliance has solved the equilibrium under assumptions of perfect information, full rationality and representative agents (Reinganum and Wilde, 1986; Erard and Feinstein, 1994). The recent application of behavioural economics to tax compliance (Hashimzade et al., 2014) allows richer assumptions such as heterogeneity and asymmetric information to be included in agent-based models. This paper investigates the tax administration's best-response audit strategy with heterogeneous taxpayers, imperfect information and evolutionary survival of taxpayers. It finds that, under these conditions, the tax administration's best-response audit strategy is an adaptive learning approach and not a well-defined audit function. This fits with actual practice of predictive analytics' by OECD tax administrations. Behavioural game theory also predicts that when actors are information rich, adaptive learning will dominate abstract thinking.","HM Revenue & Customs, London, England",,"O'Doherty, M (通讯作者)，HM Revenue & Customs, London, England.",michael.odoherty@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk,,,,,,,20,3,4,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

J,"Robson, A",,,,"Robson, Alex",,,Transaction costs can encourage Coasean bargaining,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coase Theorem; Externalities; Transaction costs; Cooperative games,THEOREM,"When there are three parties, instability problems brought about by the emptiness of the core of the corresponding cooperative game may cause the Coase Theorem to fail, even when other more direct impediments to bargaining are low. We show that the standard Coasean bargaining game involving three parties is strategically equivalent to an asymmetric three-player majority game. Hence, when there are three parties, instability problems will cause the Coase Theorem to fail if and only if the core of the corresponding three-player majority game is empty. We use this equivalence result to derive all instances in which the Coase Theorem will and will not hold with three parties, and show that a priori, such instability problems are likely to be rare-the Coase Theorem will actually hold most (over 80 %) of the time. We also demonstrate that it is always possible to find a set of transaction costs which, when introduced into a frictionless bargaining situation, will cause an empty core to become non-empty. In other words, transaction costs can mitigate instability problems: situations exist in which the presence of transaction costs will cause the Coase Theorem to hold when, in the absence of those direct transaction costs, it would fail to hold. When there are three parties, rather than hindering agreements, the existence of direct transaction costs can sometimes-but not always-reduce instability and encourage Coasean bargaining.","Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",,"Robson, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan Campus, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",a.robson@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,25,7,8,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,539,549,,10.1007/s11127-013-0117-3,0.0,,,11,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600014,0

Using an event-study approach, the paper finds that while the median increase in ODA is 18% compared with pre-disaster flows, the typical surge is small in relation to the size of the affected economies. Moreover, aid surges typically cover only 3% of the total estimated economic damages caused by the disasters. The main determinants of post-disaster aid surges are found to be the intensity of the event itself and the recipient country's characteristics such as the level of development, country size and the stock of foreign reserves. The paper does not find evidence that political considerations or strategic behavior on the part of donors determine the size of post-disaster aid surges.","[Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand; [Noy, Ilan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Becerra, Oscar] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Cavallo, Eduardo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",Victoria University Wellington; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of British Columbia; Inter-American Development Bank,"Becerra, O (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",ilan.noy@vuw.ac.nz,,"Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568; Becerra, Oscar/0000-0002-0365-9869",,,,,18,49,53,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Business education is a valuable component of adult education, and the lifelong learning represents the main channel facilitating the transfer of this knowledge. A number of three panel regression models are conducted separately for the New Member States (NMS) and Old Member States (OMS). The positive effects of business education on economic growth and duration of working life are found to be more significant and powerful in the NMS than in the OMS. The empirical analysis also shows that business education is a determinant of the subjective poverty reduction only in the OMS, while the third-level education attainment contributes to the poverty reduction in the NMS, only when been accompanied by business education.","[Dumitrache, Vlad] Lucian Blaga Univ, Sibiu, Romania; [Raileanu-Szeles, Monica] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Transylvania University of Brasov,"Dumitrache, V (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ, Sibiu, Romania.",dumi_vaderii@yahoo.com,"Szeles, Monica Raileanu/F-1455-2016","Szeles, Monica Raileanu/0000-0003-2570-8841",,,,,20,3,4,0,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,874,884,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400013,0

However, as recent experiences in some European countries have demonstrated, guarantees may link the coordination problems of bank and sovereign creditors and induce a functional interdependence between the likelihoods of a government default and bank illiquidity. Employing a global-game approach, we model this link, showing the existence and uniqueness of the joint equilibrium and derive its comparative statics properties. In equilibrium, the guarantee reduces the probability of a bank run, while it increases the probability of a sovereign default. The latter erodes the guarantee's credibility and thus its effectiveness ex ante. By setting the guarantee optimally, the government balances these two effects in order to minimize expected costs of crises. Our results show that the optimal guarantee has clear-cut welfare gains which are enhanced through policies that promote greater balance sheet transparency.

In this context, the necessity to focus on ethics as a prerequisite in regular decision-making at the level of these organisations represents a major challenge for higher education, in particular for the business administration field, which has to ensure the comprehensibility of these phenomena. The research is divided into three main sections that focus on the ethical dimension of human activities in the economy, starting from the need to integrate ethics into business education: problems and objectives of the curriculum regarding ethics, requirements for elaborating the curriculum, as well as students' perception of the introduction of Business Ethics in the curriculum. Based on the specialised literature review, the observations at the level of organisations, the analysis and structuring of structural-phenomenological information, we disseminated the objectives and requirements of a curriculum focused on business ethics. The quantitative analysis of students' perception of the discussed issue was made by means of a survey carried out among students enrolled in Master's programmes, based on a questionnaire. The relevant elements were identified to validate the research hypotheses: relevant business factors (profit, risk, financial viability, the need for ethics and the involvement in community problems), the explanatory variables of ethical behaviour (the education, the mission and the value system, the existence of a code of ethics and of a person responsible for ethics-related issues), the requirements of the business environment in education (focus on practical aspects of Business Ethics courses, combining theoretical sessions with practical ones, cooperation with the business environment, the use of case studies as a didactic tool and updating the content of Business Ethics courses), as well as the competitive advantages gained by introducing Business Ethics in the curriculum (high degree of comprehension, more opportunities, competitiveness, efficiency in fulfilling responsibilities). The use of statistical instruments made it possible to reach conclusions regarding the necessity to include ethics in business education and its formative impact, as well as regarding the existing correlations between ethical behaviour and education.","[Petcu, Monica; Dinu, Eduard] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Petcu, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",petcu_mona_a@yahoo.com,,"Petcu, Monica Aureliana/0000-0003-0725-5770",,,,,24,1,2,0,27,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,917,931,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400016,0

We answer this question for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stock markets. Empirically, we test the occurrence of structural breaks in the GCC return data using the Inclan and Tiao (1994)'s algorithm and we check the relevance of LM using Shimotsu (2006) procedure before estimating the ARFIMA-FIGARCH and ARFIMA-FIAPARCH models with different innovations' distributions and computing VaR and ES. Our results show that all the GCC market's volatilities exhibit significant structural breaks matching mainly with the 2008-2009 global financial crises and the Arab spring. Also, they are governed by LM process either in the mean or in the conditional variance which cannot be due to the occurrence of structural breaks. Furthermore, the forecasting ability analysis shows that the FIAPARCH model under skewed Student-t distribution turn out to improve substantially the VaR and the ES forecasts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Empirical results demonstrate that the exceedance correlations between oil and exchange rate returns are both positive and symmetrical, indicating that the two return rates move in the same direction and that the relationship between them is symmetrical for the upper and lower quantiles. The crude oil-exchange rate relationship is sensitive to the sample period investigated. Before the 1998 financial crisis, exceedance correlations are close to zero, showing almost no correlation between the oil and exchange rate markets. However, the positive co-movement has significantly increased since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, Kendall's tau coefficients of two symmetrized copulas greatly increase after the 2008 financial crisis, revealing that the probability of both returns moving in the same direction is higher than it is in the opposite direction.

Our method is based on probabilitic approach. We derive the probability of multiple crossings of curved barriers for Brownian motion with drift, by repeatedly applying the Girsanov theorem and the reflection principle. The price of a standard double barrier option is presented as an infinite sum that converges very rapidly. Although the price formula of standard double barrier option is the same with Kunitomo and Ikeda (1992), our method gives an intuitive interpretation for each term in the infinite series. From the intuitive interpretation we present the way how to approximate the infinite sum in the pricing formula and an error bound for the given approximation. Guillaume (2003) and Jun and Ku (2013) assumed that barriers are constant to price barrier options. We extend constant barriers of window double barrier option and chained option to curved barriers. By employing multiple crossing probabilities and previous skills we derive closed formula for prices of 16 types of the generalized chained option. Based on our analytic formulas we compute Greeks of chained options directly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we concentrate on a retiree's optimal consumption and portfolio selection over his remaining years of life. We apply the logistic model of mortality thus modeling the empirically observed increase of mortality during the retirement period. The optimal consumption strategy and portfolio choice are established by reducing the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann equation to the explicit solution of an ordinary differential function (ODF) that includes the mortality rate. A general finding is that the Merton-Samuelson result of constant portfolio choice for a constant mortality is confirmed for arbitrary mortality. The portfolio choice is only influenced by risk and return of assets and the retirees ' risk aversion. To get the specific optimal consumption strategy in a realistic situation the logistic model of mortality has been fitted to the data of the Statistical Yearbook for the Federal Republic of Germany 2006/2008. The optimal initial value for the ODF is obtained by numerical methods. The solution provides a large increase in the ratio of optimal consumption to wealth up to about 92 years followed by a sharp decrease. A bequest motive dampens the magnitudes of the ups and downs of the consumption ratio but does not change the basic shape.,"[Kremer, Alexander] Univ Rostock, Chair Stat, D-18055 Rostock, Germany; [Liese, Friedrich] Univ Rostock, Dept Math, D-18055 Rostock, Germany; [Homoelle, Susanne] Univ Rostock, Chair Banking & Finance, D-18055 Rostock, Germany",University of Rostock; University of Rostock; University of Rostock,"Kremer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rostock, Chair Stat, D-18055 Rostock, Germany.",susanne.homoelle@uni-rostock.de,,,,,,,52,3,4,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

In these approaches, equity issues are not taken into account and, consequently, most of the road improvements are planned next to large cities. Thus, disparities between large and small cities increase, which does not conform to sustainable development objectives. In this paper, to overcome concerns associated with traditional methods, equity is incorporated into the interurban road network design problem. To this end, accessibility concepts are employed. However, unlike previous studies, instead of maximizing the total accessibility, a new definition is proposed for inaccessibility, and total inaccessibility is minimized throughout the network. Using this new definition not only is more compatible with the equity issue, but also helps to eliminate the nonlinearity of the problem. Average travel time to neighboring opportunities is utilized to propose this definition for inaccessibility, which captures the reality more effectively. With the aim of this definition, equity is incorporated into the road network design problem implicitly. This is another improvement over previous methods, where a new term in the objective function or a new constraint is added to include the equity. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, where the objective is to minimize the aggregate inaccessibility over all the population centers in the network. To illustrate the application of the model, the Northwest region of the United States is used as the case study. The respective exact solution of the example is found using a commercial solver (CPLEX). This new solution is also compared with the solutions from the traditional methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that, regardless of whether voting rights or the number of directors on company boards are used to measure control rights, companies with higher degrees of deviation between control and cash flow rights pay disproportionately large shares of company earnings in employee bonuses relative to shareholder dividends. Severe deviation companies are biased in favor of employee compensation at the expense of minority shareholders.

We show that the eco-friendliness ranking of political regime types varies with the cost of private mitigation and that increased inequality has non-monotonous effects on equilibrium pollution levels.

The impact of the EU economic governance pillars is evaluated based on both the performance before and after their application as well as against the control group. We find strong and robust evidence that neither the Stability and Growth Pact nor the Lisbon Strategy have had a significant beneficial impact on fiscal and economic performance outcomes. We conclude that a profound reform of these pillars is needed to make them work in the next decade. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The theoretical basis for doing so dates back to Phelps (1973) and has been greatly refined ever since. Since optimal taxation minimizes the deadweight loss by equalizing the marginal distortions of all available taxes, including the inflation tax, a key distinctive theoretical implication obtained by these models is that inflation and tax rates have a positive relationship. While theoretically appealing, empirical studies find virtually no support for this key implication. We show that, considering the role of central bank independence (CBI), it is possible to reconcile the main theoretical implications of models of optimal taxation and seigniorage with the empirical evidence. Different degrees of CBI capture the extent to which monetary policy is effectively controlled by the fiscal authority. Our model generates three testable implications: i) if CBI is low, the optimal relationship between inflation and tax rates is positive, ii) such relationship is a decreasing function of the degree of CBI, and iii) the relationship is negative for high levels of CBI. We show that these hypotheses hold for alternative measures of tax policy, seigniorage, and CBI as well as after controlling for several macroeconomic performance, ideology, political instability, governance, and economic structural/development factors.

Countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela, in which the investment framework has become relatively less stable over the last decade, are finding it more difficult to attract foreign investors. From a risk-management perspective, both public solutions (such as sovereign guarantees) and private institutions have important roles to play in reducing the uncertainty involved in foreign investment decisions. Another result is that the DR CAFTA agreement does not seem to have played a significant role in the recent increase in investment directed towards Central America. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper fills this gap by examining the patterns and determinants of China's border trade with its neighboring countries. First, a disaggregated, firm-product level trade data is used to provide a detailed overview of border trade growth and dynamics. The paper shows that trade liberalization has significantly encouraged new firms to enter the export market, and new private firms account for the majority of the expansion in border exports and the shift toward more sophisticated products. Second, a gravity model is used to investigate the determinants of border trade. The results suggest that multilateral and regional integration, market size and institutional quality play important roles in promoting border trade.","[Ge, Ying; He, Yin; Jiang, Yeheng; Yin, Xiaopeng] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Yin, XP (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 10 Huixin St East,POB 119, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xyin_ca@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,6,6,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We find that increasing the share of fiscal spending in GDP and shifting the emphasis towards spending in public goods and against non-social subsidies significantly lower the concentrations of sulfur dioxide and ozone but not nitrogen dioxide. At the same time, energy taxes reduce nitrogen dioxide concentrations but have no effect on ozone and sulfur dioxide.

Overall, the empirical findings reveal that this type of transport in the Italian Alps can be regarded as relatively economically inefficient and most of the cableways denote decreasing returns to scale.

However, a weakness is that current stress tests are based on consolidated balance sheets, and thus omit potential risks embedded in banking groups' geographical structures by assuming that capital and liquidity are available wherever they are needed within the group. This study presents a framework to integrate ring fencing and regulatory differences (e.g., minimum capital requirements) into cross-border bank stress tests. Case studies show how some forms of ring fencing-home or host regulators limiting flows of capital and income within a group-could significantly increase banks' capital needs.

This restriction was officially rescinded in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act. In turn, this development has piqued the interest of scholars and renewed the debate on the role that commercial banks play, as well as the consequences of this role in equity offerings, which may either result in conflict of interest or certification. In this study, we comprehensively examine whether conflict of interest or certification more accurately characterizes the underwriting of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) by lending-relationship banks. Overall, the results suggest that the presence of lending-relationship banks lowers the gross spreads and underpricing of SEOs. Furthermore, our evidence shows that SEOs led by lending-relationship banks exhibit better long-run performance than other SEOs, which supports the certification hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The regulator wants to speed up the path of technology adoption generated by a policy of uniform enforcement (that monitors adopters and nonadopters with the same probability) by engaging in a regulatory deal where a reduced monitoring probability is granted in exchange for adoption of the new technology. We set up a theoretical model, characterize the circumstances in which such dealing minimizes aggregate emissions, and test our hypothesis using economic laboratory experiments. Our analytical and experimental results suggest that even though such a deal might imply an increased level of violation by adopters, such tolerance is rather an integral part of an overall enforcement strategy that minimizes aggregate emissions when the rate of adoption is endogenous.

What are the mechanisms? This paper examines the effect of R&D tax credits on firms' R&D expenditure by exploiting the variation across firms in the changes in the eligible tax credit rate between 2000 and 2003. Estimating the first-difference equation of the linear R&D model by panel GMM, we find the estimated coefficient of an interaction term between the eligible tax credit rate and the debt-to-asset ratio is positive and significant, indicating that the effect of tax credit is significantly larger for firms with relatively large outstanding debts. Conducting counterfactual experiments, we found that the aggregate R&D expenditure in 2003 would have been lower by 3.0-3.4 percent if there had been no tax credit reform in 2003, where 0.3-0.6 percent is attributable to the effect of financial constraint, and that the aggregate R&D expenditure would. have been larger by 3.1-3.9 percent if there had been no cap on the amount of tax credits, where 0.3-0.8 percent is attributable to relaxing the financial constraint of firms with outstanding debts.

While child outcomes and socioeconomic status (SES) are highly correlated, the effect of income on child outcomes, controlling for other SES factors, is found to be statistically significant but of much smaller magnitude than correlation alone indicates.

As an example, we consider the variation in rainfall and temperature projected by the recent UK Climate Impacts Programme. The analysis implements a spatially explicit, econometric model of agricultural land use based on the methodology recently developed by Fezzi and Bateman (Am J Agric Econ 93:1168-1188, 2011). Land use area and livestock stocking rates are then employed to calculate farm gross margin estimates of the value of changes in provisioning ecosystem services. Findings suggest that the variation in ecosystem inputs induced by climate change will have substantial influence on agricultural productivity.

We analyze the incentives of credit rating agencies to issue unsolicited credit ratings and the effects of this practice on the agencies' rating strategies. We find that issuance of unfavorable unsolicited credit ratings enables rating agencies to extract higher fees from issuers by credibly threatening to punish those that refuse to acquire a rating. Also, issuing unfavorable unsolicited ratings increases the rating agencies' reputation by demonstrating to investors that they resist the temptation to issue inflated ratings. In equilibrium, unsolicited credit ratings are lower than solicited ratings, because all favorable ratings are solicited; however, they do not have a downward bias. We show that, under certain conditions, a credit rating system that incorporates unsolicited ratings leads to more stringent rating standards.","[Fulghieri, Paolo] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Strobl, Guenter] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Xia, Han] Univ Texas Dallas, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Frankfurt School Finance & Management; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Strobl, G (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",g.strobl@fs.de,,"Strobl, Gunter/0000-0002-9067-9680",,,,,27,71,76,4,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

They find a common stochastic trend in a three-variable system that includes output, consumption, and investment, but the explanatory power of the common trend drops significantly when they add money balances and the nominal interest rate. In this paper, we revisit the cointegration tests in the spirit of King etal., using improved monetary aggregates whose construction has been stimulated by the Barnett critique. We show that previous rejections of the balanced growth hypothesis and classical money demand functions can be attributed to mismeasurement of the monetary aggregates.","[Serletis, Apostolos] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Gogas, Periklis] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Thrace, Greece",University of Calgary; Democritus University of Thrace,"Serletis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",Serletis@ucalgary.ca; pgkogkas@ieard.duth.gr,"Gogas, Periklis/N-8162-2014","Gogas, Periklis/0000-0002-5134-3869",,,,,30,45,46,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We use data from a household survey conducted in 2005, with a particular focus on a dependent variable that reflects farmers' ordinal responses to a question about their probability of converting the enrolled lands back to cultivation after the program ends. First, we find that targeting the program on steeper sloped and lower quality plots can significantly decrease the probability of reconversion. Second, there is a significant and robust household income structure effect on the reconversion probability. Third, participating households with the right to decide what to plant on enrolled land have a higher probability of maintaining the reforested land after the program ends. Finally, subsidy shortfall has a positive influence on the probability of reconversion.","[Yang, Xiaojun] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Xu, Jintao] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jintao] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; Peking University; Peking University,"Yang, XJ (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",xiaojun.yang@economics.gu.se; xujt@pku.edu.cn,,"Xu, Jintao/0000-0001-5588-2942",,,,,31,12,15,0,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Its fertility rate is now around 2.5 births per woman, which, if sustained, would add substantial numbers to Indonesia's population in the future. There are concerns within Indonesia that the present level of population growth is an obstacle to continued economic development and, accordingly, that fertility should be reduced to the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman as soon as possible. Yet a comparative perspective indicates that countries such as Singapore, Japan, and Thailand are concerned about the effects that their very low rates of fertility are having on their labour forces and their rates of population ageing. This article suggests that with the right policy settings Indonesia can avoid this outcome yet continue to reduce its fertility. It discusses the implications of Indonesia's population growth and distribution for its economy, as well as the poor quality of demographic data. Setelah berhasil menurunkan angka kelahiran selama 40 tahun terakhir, Indonesia kini berada di persimpangan demografis yang baru. Tingkat kelahiran saat ini berada di kisaran 2,5 kelahiran per wanita. Jika berkelanjutan, jumlah tersebut akan menambah populasi Indonesia secara substansial. Ada kekuatiran baru bahwa tingkat pertumbuhan populasi saat ini adalah hambatan bagi pembangunan ekonomi yang berkelanjutan. Oleh karenanya, muncul saran agar angka kelahiran dikurangi sesegera mungkin, ke tingkat 2.1 kelahiran per wanita. Sebaliknya, negara-negara seperti Singapura, Jepang, dan Thailand kini sedang mengalami kekuatiran akan dampak dari tingkat kelahiran yang sangat rendah bagi angkatan kerja mereka, disertai populasi yang menua. Tulisan ini memberikan pandangan bahwa dengan kebijakan yang tepat, Indonesia dapat mengurangi angka tingkat kelahiran sekaligus menghindari apa yang kini dialami oleh Singapura, Jepang, dan Thailand tersebut. Selain itu, tulisan ini juga mendiskusikan mengenai implikasi pertumbuhan dan distribusi populasi Indonesia bagi perekonomiannya serta buruknya kualitas data demografis di Indonesia.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"McDonald, P (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,"McDonald, Peter/0000-0001-5579-0335",,,,,27,22,22,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

In the case of the Economic and Monetary Union in Europe the previous indicators were not enough to establishing an environment of fiscal discipline. Therefore, new limits regarding the structural deficit were imposed through the Treaty of Stability Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. However, experience shows that removing cyclical and other transitory elements from revenues and expenditure is not an easy task. This study will provide a clear understanding of the methodology used by the International Monetary Fund in order to quantify the structural deficit, its shortcomings, a comparison with the results obtained by the European Commission and recommendations. Furthermore, it will show that, despite the limits of the evaluating the structural fiscal balance, this represents the right indicator for stating where the economy is heading over the medium term.","[Anton, Sorin Gabriel; Puiu, Cristina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,sorin.anton@uaic.ro; puiu.cristina@yahoo.com,"Anton, Sorin/P-5613-2014","Anton, Sorin/0000-0001-7124-9274",,,,,9,0,0,0,24,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,49,55,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000005,0

The sections of the paper focus on emotional knowledge that we approached from different angles and in correlation to critical issues encountered in negotiations. Within the first section we present some perspectives on the emotions-negotiation relationship in order to point out their interdependence and the importance of emotions for the negotiation process, weather is a business or social negotiation. This interest has been fueled by the idea that emotions play a key role in the relations between negotiators and help or hinder strategic concessions among them. The second part of the paper systematically explains the phenomenon of emotional knowledge dynamics by bringing into focus the concept of emotional knowledge-cognitive knowledge dyad. This knowledge dynamic emphasizes the link between emotional expressions and processing the information. Knowledge dynamics is a very complex issue to investigate since all transformations happen in our mind and body.

The authors use a factor supply approach to show that this hypothesis is not necessarily correct. They use a two-good, two-factor, small open economy model to show that terrorism can either reduce or raise trade depending on critical factors, such as the impact of terrorism on the intensive factor of the export or the import sector. They then extend the analysis to models with several goods and factors and identify conditions under which trade may rise or fall with a greater incidence of terrorism. Finally, they provide an analysis of the effects of terrorism on trade in the presence of an optimal counterterrorism policy.

This article describes why it is underutilised and how it could be employed more systematically to reduce risk in the most hazard prone areas in countries such as the Philippines.

However, issues such as noise, changes in the landscape or availability of land for agricultural activities are often a matter of controversy or rejection by the population. The energy matrix in Brazil is already largely supported on hydroelectric plants. However, following the example of other countries, other renewable technologies with particular emphasis on wind or solar power have been gaining relevance. This paper addresses the integration of renewable energies in the Brazilian energy matrix and the evaluation of its external impacts and social acceptability.

These results suggest that management accountants are responsive to the demands of their firms' manufacturing practices and that this participation not only helps to enhance the benefits of WCM, but also firm performance in other ways.","[Duh, Rong-Ruey; Hsu, Audrey Wen-hsin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Accounting, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Duh, RR (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Accounting, Taipei, Taiwan.",rrduh@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,59,1,1,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

SC is best thought of as socio - technical system where complex production technologies interact with intelligent, autonomous entities. My personal experience with SC modelling and optimisation shows that better than the application of a set of balance equations similar in structure to those used to model for example chemical processes is to adopt an alternative modelling paradigm when dealing with supply chain dynamics. This new paradigm is called agent - based modelling. In this paper I present a basic framework designed for supply chain modelling and optimisation consisting of several types of agents controlled by a set of algorithms. This framework is realized in Witness simulation software environment supported by Excel for input data loading and outputs upgrading. I apply proposed framework in a task dealing with material handling system design in a production plant coming from machinery industry. This system is based on milk-run supplies feeding production lines with input materials and handling semi-finished and final products through the manufacturing process to warehouse.","[Dyntar, Jakub] Prague Inst Chem Technol, Tech 5, CR-16628 Prague, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Dyntar, J (通讯作者)，Prague Inst Chem Technol, Tech 5, CR-16628 Prague, Czech Republic.",dyntarj@vscht.cz,"Dyntar, Jakub/HDN-5719-2022","Dyntar, Jakub/0000-0002-5927-9443",,,,,7,0,0,0,15,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,2000,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300203,0

A somewhat neglected fact is the ageing of the labor force. In the Czech Republic the increase of labor force of older age will be caused not only by the irregularities in the age structure, but also by the permanent increase of retirement age. Because of these two reasons the proportion of people in productive age older 50 years will almost double during next two decades. The article includes an analysis of the development of the sex-and-age structure of the Czech population of productive age based on the latest population projection published by the Czech Statistical Office last year. In all variants of development the labor force will be ageing, the average age of persons in productive age will increase. The proportion of younger workers will decline; whereas the proportion of employees over the age of 50 years will increase relatively strongly. Because of the fact that the increase of retirement age of females is twice as high as for males (and will be three times higher) the most important challenge will be to find appropriate labor opportunities for females older 60 years.

People believed that an increasing number of entrepreneurs could level down the number of unemployment and decrease the number of corruptions in this country. Many studies have been trying to classified different terms of entrepreneurs and its issues but few have studied on entrepreneurs in Indonesia and their motivations. Referring to what Richomme-Huet and De-Freyman (2011) had mentioned in their article, there are four types of entrepreneurs: regular entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs, green entrepreneurs, and sustainable entrepreneurs. This study examined the classification of Indonesian entrepreneurs and their motivations. The data was collected by giving out a structured close-ended online survey to a number of entrepreneurs which were chosen purposively-random. A cluster analysis using SPSS program was used to ensure the accuracy of analysis. It is found that the majority of Indonesian entrepreneurs classified themselves into sustainable entrepreneurs where profit, planet and people is the core values of business although by observation, they seemed to care more about material profits. Moreover, their highest motivation of business was the need to increase their income. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The rats were divided into three groups (12 in each) according to the duration of psychological stress: 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 weeks of recovery. A fourth group of 12 rats was used as the control. Each rat was evaluated by the open-field test and weight was measured: the results confirmed psychological stress in 24 of the 36 rats (67%). The TMJ joint tissues were stained with HE and observed under a light microscope for pathological changes. MMP-3 and TIMP-3 expression was investigated using the SP kit. The experimental groups showed thinning of articular cartilage, collagen fiber shedding, articular disk cracks, and other structural changes that were aggravated with time, from three weeks to six weeks. The 6-week recovery group showed an improvement in these changes, which indicated the initiation of joint repair. The MMP-3 expression rate correlated with the degree of joint lesion, while the TIMP-3 rate showed an opposite trend and was highest in the 6-week recovery group. Our findings clearly indicate that chronic psychological stress may play an important role in the development of TMJ diseases in rat; further studies should be conducted to extrapolate the results to other models and eventually the clinical setting.","[Huang, Xu; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Hong-yu] Xinjiang Med Univ, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xu; Liu, Hai-xia; Xiao, Peng; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Hong-yu] Xinjiang Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Stomatol, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China",Xinjiang Medical University; Xinjiang Medical University,"Huang, X (通讯作者)，Xinjiang Med Univ, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-188-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,360,366,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3SZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351923900060,0

Firstly, South Africa's major markets for citrus are characterised according to a growth-share matrix to identify strategic country markets. Secondly, the paper uses an Indicative Trade Potential analysis to identify strategic markets that are high potential export countries. Thirdly, a gravity model is used to identify which strategic high potential markets are encouraging South African citrus exports. Out of South Africa's 51 major citrus export destinations, 44 countries are considered strategic markets. From these 44 strategic markets, 26 are high potential markets. Among the 26 high potential markets, an identified 17 countries represent the most attractive markets that possess opportunities for greater export expansion. These 17 countries can be prioritised for an export promotion strategy: six are in the EU, four are in Asia, and two are in Eastern Europe; while three are from Middle East and two from North America. The paper concludes that more aggressive trade policy efforts should also be directed towards nine countries which are high potential markets, but exhibit trade-inhibiting features discouraging South Africa's citrus exports. Trade facilitation efforts and bilateral agreements with such countries could be considered as an option to lock in the benefits of unexploited export potential in key strategic citrus export markets.","[Kapuya, Tinashe] Agr Business Chamber Agbiz, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa; [Kalaba, Mmatlou W.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Kapuya, T (通讯作者)，Agr Business Chamber Agbiz, Grain Bldg,1st Floor,477 Witherite Rd, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa.",tinashekapuya@gmail.com; Evans@tips.org.za; Mmatlou.Kalaba@up.ac.za,"Kalaba, Mmatlou/AAJ-7648-2021","KALABA, Mmatlou/0000-0002-9501-8128",,,,,18,6,9,2,16,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2014,53.0,1,,,,,124,158,,10.1080/03031853.2014.887908,0.0,,,35,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AB9DZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332091600006,0

The concept of social capital offers the potential to provide insights into this process and thereby gain a better understanding of organisational resourcefulness in a time of major disruption. Although disaster research has shown social capital to influence the resilience of place-based communities who suffer impacts of earthquakes, floods, power outages and domestic water supply contamination, bringing the concepts together in an organisational or business context has received little attention. Drawing upon data gathered as part of an ongoing EPSRC funded project, our paper presents some emerging findings from the project. We show how small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) in a UK case study were able to exploit their social capital for the necessary resources to help them survive the impacts of a severe flood event. Further, the nature of the resourcefulness may display a level of path-dependence related to the type of business. These preliminary findings show that firms which managed to recover quickly tended to demonstrate high levels of resourcefulness and problem solving capability. We find that flexibility, organisational culture and certain mindsets associated with particular professions e.g. engineering, appear to have a positive effect. Leveraging social capital, that is, the ability to utilise relationships and networks outside of the firm also emerges strongly as a critical factor which allowed some firms to respond and recover more quickly than others. This combined with bricolage, the ability to adapt and create necessary resources and solutions from internal resources and/or resources outside of the firm, characterises firms that minimised the period of flood disruption.
