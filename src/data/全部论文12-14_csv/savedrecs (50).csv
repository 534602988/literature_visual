Also, prior studies have shown that new ideas which reflect consumer needs and wants have the highest success-potential, and firms adopt such new ideas. It is generally assumed that consumer generated ideas ` always' reflect their needs and wants. However, this assumption may not be always true. For example, consumers in online brand communities of Dell, Starbucks, Nutella, etc., are found to post new ideas which are not only need-based, but they also post, 1) market trend based ideas, 2) radical ideas, or 3) redundant ideas, and hence, selecting the most promising consumer generated ideas is challenging for firms. To overcome this challenge, this study takes into account the source of each idea, such as, need-based, solution-based, trend or competitor based, and mental invention, in selecting the most promising idea. By combining this knowledge, that is, the source of each idea, with the degree of shared identity (shared agreement minus shared disagreement) towards each idea; this study help selecting the most promising idea by predicting the success potential of each idea, and its likelihood of being adopted by firms.","[Divakaran, Pradeep Kumar Ponnamma] ESC Rennes Sch Business, Strategy & Mkt Dept, F-35065 Rennes, France",ESC Rennes School of Business; Universite de Rennes,,pradeep.divakaran@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,730,740,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100073,0

The authors infer institutional shareholders' investment horizons using the churn rate of their overall stock portfolios prior to the payout decision. The authors find that the frequency and amount of repurchases increases with ownership by short-term investors to the detriment of dividends. They also find that the market reacts less positively to repurchase announcements made by firms held by short-term institutions. These findings are consistent with a model in which undervalued firms signal their value through repurchases, but firms held by short-term investors make repurchases more often because those investors care mostly about the short-term price reaction. Hence, the market rationally discounts the signal provided by such repurchases. Our findings suggest that shorter shareholder investment horizons might be one contributing factor to the increasing popularity of buybacks.","[Gaspar, Jose-Miguel] ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy Pontoise, France; [Massa, Massimo] INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France; [Matos, Pedro] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",ESSEC Business School; INSEAD Business School; University of Virginia,"Gaspar, JM (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy Pontoise, France.",,,"Gaspar, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-4758-837X",,,,,86,75,80,5,80,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Such a huge amount of prosperous employees is a sufficient stimulus for the majority of employers to study the factors that make the company attractive in the eyes of the students, in order to gain attention of the most talented of them, convince them to join the organisation, and keep them engaged and satisfied within. To address this problem, an online survey aiming at the students of Czech agricultural universities, focusing on their future career perceptions was launched in the second quarter of 2013. The questions asked were loosely based on the research study conducted in 2012 by the US Achievers company. The original research was designed primarily to help employers to improve their corporate presentation on the labour market by considering the expectations about the future employment, and the main motivations for joining an organisation among the current generation of graduates (Achievers, Inc., 2012). The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current situation, and the comparison between the results of the initial study and the data gathered from the questionnaire targeting the students of the CULS.","[Gojda, Ondrej; Martinek, Tomas; Hanzlik, Petr] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Informat Engn, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Gojda, O (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Informat Engn, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",gojda@pef.czu.cz; martinekt@pef.czu.cz; hanzlikp@pef.czu.cz,"Martínek, Tomáš/GVU-6458-2022; Hanzlík, Petr/W-5419-2019; Martínek, Tomáš/JXX-9520-2024","Hanzlík, Petr/0000-0002-3022-9135; Martinek, Tomas/0000-0002-4295-0886",,,,,5,0,0,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,125,135,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300011,0

It considers the gendered dynamics of employment in two wine export value chains. In one of the chains, produce is packaged and branded in South Africa for export and in the other, bulk wine is sold for packaging and branding in Europe. The research draws on a survey of workers and in-depth interviews with managers, industry and farm worker support organisations. It considers the possible impact of the adoption of a Code of Conduct on labour standards by the Swedish alcohol retail monopoly, Systembolaget. The research reinforces findings over more than a decade that female workers are concentrated in lower paid, more fragmented and insecure employment. The findings reveal that processors are more or less compliant with national labour standards, but supplier farms are less so, especially in bulk chains. Monitoring at the individual farm level is missing. This makes it difficult to track compliance of codes down to farm level. The study queries the sustainability of initiatives to improve labour standards on farms, should costs be borne entirely by producers who are already facing a cost-price squeeze.","Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agrarian Studies, DST NRF Chair Poverty Land & Agrarian Studies, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Greenberg, S (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agrarian Studies, DST NRF Chair Poverty Land & Agrarian Studies, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",stephen.greenberg@axxess.co.za,,,Africa Groups of Sweden (AGS),Africa Groups of Sweden (AGS),"This is a shortened version of a paper funded by and produced for Africa Groups of Sweden (AGS).

Data pertaining hospitals characteristics, current approach of the hospital to deliver health promotion services, and the frequency of hospitals in providing specific health promotion activities were collected using questionnaire items developed by the researchers. The result from the analyses revealed significant differences in mean scores among larger, not-for-profit, and quality accredited hospitals. These hospitals were likely to employ a broader approach to deliver health promotion services that commonly include hospital staff and general public in their service provisions. Results from multiple regression analyses performed indicate that hospital characteristics (catchment area, quality accreditation, teaching commitment and research involvement), hospital approach to delivery health promotion services and conformance with WHO-HPH standard 3 and 4 significantly predict the frequency of health promotion delivery as high as 98% F(12,164) = 1176.051 p <.001. When these variables tested individually using a hierarchical regression analysis, hospital characteristics namely catchment area, quality accreditation, teaching commitment and research involvement contributed most to the prediction, even when the other variables were statistically controlled.

Moreover the issue of precariousness becomes very frequently the subject of discussions that try to find response in what extent this tendency is something useful for overcoming the actual crisis impacts on the labour market and in what rate it is a dangerous way leading to distortion of labour world and to expansion of amount of working poor.

These results imply that an active monetary policy stance may account for nonlinearities in the exchange rate-fundamentals nexus. The strong evidence of nonlinearities also confirms the notion that exchange rate movements cannot be explained exclusively in terms of any one particular exchange rate model. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The data cover the period of 2005 - 2010 for the OECD countries. The results of empirical analyzes show that economic growth is positively influenced by government spending, while the effect of taxation is negative for all types of taxes. Government expenditures are negatively influenced by both economic growth and the size of the taxation.

Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM is a form of producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access.","[Perotin, Virginie] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Matchaya, Greenwell Collins] Int Water Management Inst, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Leeds; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Matchaya, GC (通讯作者)，Int Water Management Inst, Pretoria, South Africa.",g.matchaya@cgiar.org; vp@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,NORAD; Government of Norway,NORAD(CGIAR); Government of Norway,"Thanks are due to NORAD and the Government of Norway for the financial support without which this research would have been impossible to conduct.

To overcome the problems of mass tourism, many governments, businesses, communities, and tourism organizations have turned to alternative types of tourism development. One such alternative is 'special interest tourism'. While this has become a centre of attention for the tourism industry, in academic and professional literature, there is still much that is not known or is not widely known. The present paper underlines the necessity of internationally monitoring the ecological state of our planet,developed societies have to assume, based on their material and intelligence resources, the main part of the obligations of developing countries, which are forced to channel their efforts towards other priorities in order to respond to their most stringent necessities. Their support might help all the states to wisely advance and we refer here to both industrialization process and environment protection. On the one hand, an unpolluted environment is vital for tourism sector within the EU; the community politics for environmental protection is relevant for tourism and make reference to water quality, reduction of air pollution or improvement of urban environment quality. Post-crisis challenge for Romania is the organization and development of its natural and cultural resources in a range of tourism products with a wide appeal to the public, and transforming these attractions in a flow of tourists and benefits for the country. This requires an integrated product development and strategic marketing approach, and more attention to the environmental problems and sustainable development of tourism and environment. This study uses a framework developed from the industrial ecology literature to assess the impacts of the tourism industry on the environment. The greening of tourism, which involves efficiency improvements in energy, water, and waste systems, is expected to reinforce the employment potential of the sector with increased local hiring and sourcing and significant opportunities in tourism oriented toward local culture and the natural environment. Green tourism embraces all aspects of sustainable tourism, based on four basic principles(1) (UNWTO): environmental, social, economic and climate (i.e. the quadruple bottom line of sustainable tourism). Green tourism minimizes the environmental impact of tourism and maximizes its adaptation to climate change. However, educational efforts geared towards industry sectors seem most effective when cost savings and the marketing benefits of being green (2)are emphasized in this article.","[Mazilu, Mirela] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,,,"Mazilu, Mirela ELENA/M-5533-2013","Mazilu, Mirela ELENA/0000-0003-2009-7092",,,,,11,2,2,1,24,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,331,338,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400044,0

The paper was basically modeled to examine the effects of board size, ownership structure, CEO duality and board independence on the dividend payout decisions of firms operating in Nigerian using the regression analysis method. Findings from the study revealed that board size, ownership structure, CEO duality and board independence had a significant positive effect on the dividend payout decisions of the sampled firms.

The producers tend to use high risk strategies which include the selling of the crop on the cash market after harvest; while the high market risks require innovative strategies including the use of futures and options as traded on South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX). This is mostly due to a lack of interest and knowledge of the market. The purpose of the study is to examine whether the adoption of basic routine strategies is better than adopting no strategy at all. The study illustrates that by using a Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to a Function (SERF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) that the use of three basic strategies for each crop type, namely, a Put (plant time)-, (Three-segment-), (Critical Moment in production/marketing process) and Sell after pollination can be more rewarding. These strategies can be adopted by farmers without an in-depth understanding of the market and market signals. The results obtained from the study illustrate that each strategy is different for each crop. It also indicates that no strategy is worse than a specific strategy and that the choice between strategies depends on the risk aversion level of the producer. It is imperative to note that the use of hedging strategies is better than no strategy at all.","[Venter, M. M.; Strydom, D.

Many countries have attached great importance to train the research ability of university or college students, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (U. S.), in 1969, created Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program that originally encouraged and supported the eligible undergraduates to participate in research programs[3]. Since then, the other two, Stanford University and California University, respectively started their Undergraduate Research Office and Undergraduate Research Center which organized and provided services for the research of undergraduate. At present, similar as the United States [3], the institutionalized and standardized research activities have widely spread in other countries, such as Australia and Japan. In China, the student research training program (SRT) has started from Tsinghua University since 1969, followed by University of Science and Technology of China, Zhejiang University, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, etc., of which the education systems for training research and innovation have been constructed and implemented.

One such trend is land-use changes; the fact that some investors purchase farmland in South Africa to not farm - for the sake of investment only. Research that was done in 2011 in the south-eastern Nama Karoo confirmed that purchasers buy farmland at significant prices primarily as investments, although not on a grand scale. The research was done quantitatively and qualitatively. It was confirmed that in this part of the Nama Karoo, like in many other parts in South Africa, there is indeed a trend of new investors purchasing land for its sheer beauty and natural magnificence, something that they believe will increase in value and which is a sound investment for the future. Questions were asked: How might this impact on farmland values and how will property valuers interpret this changed land use? And, how should farmland be valued in future if this trend prevails and expands? The research confirmed that investors buy farmland for secondary (non-agricultural) reasons, which result in land prices almost double the average. Pure investment is a primary driver in the decision-making process and is based on a view that the future capital growth is enough to justify the investment. It was also shown that the typical investor is around 50 years old, financially extremely well off, and mostly professional. As potential non-commercial farmland owners, they are also not necessarily applauded by current commercial farmers.","[Wessels, J. S. F.; Willemse, B.

This paper investigates whether risk management-related corporate governance mechanisms, such as for example the presence of a chief risk officer (CRO) in a bank's executive board and whether the CRO reports to the CEO or directly to the board of directors, are associated with a better bank performance during the financial crisis of 2007/2008. We measure bank performance by buy-and-hold returns and ROE and we control for standard corporate governance variables such as CEO ownership, board size, and board independence. Most importantly, our results indicate that banks, in which the CRO directly reports to the board of directors and not to the CEO (or other corporate entities), exhibit significantly higher (i.e., less negative) stock returns and ROE during the crisis. In contrast, standard corporate governance variables are mostly insignificantly or even negatively related to the banks' performance during the crisis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate the Treynor and Mazuy (1966) and Henriksson and Merton (1981) models augmented with the size, value, and momentum factors, either under the OLS method adjusted with the Newey-West procedure or under the GARCH(1,1)-in-mean method following the specification of Glosten et al. (1993; hereafter GJR-GARCH-M). We find that the OLS method provides little evidence in favour of the selectivity and timing ability, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, the GJR-GARCH-M method reverses this result, showing some relatively strong evidence on favourable selectivity ability, particularly for international funds, as well as favourable timing ability, particularly for domestic funds. We conclude that the CJR-GARCH-M method performs better in evaluating fund performance compared with the OLS method and the non-parametric approach, as it essentially accounts for the time-varying characteristics of factor loadings and hence obtains more reliable results, in particular, when the high frequency data, such as the daily returns, are used in the analysis. Our results are robust to various in-sample and out-of-sample tests and have valuable implications for practitioners in making their asset allocation decisions across different fund styles.

Households entertain a pessimistic view of the world and their pessimism varies with the overall level of volatility in the economy, implying an amplification of the effects of volatility shocks.

We conclude that, despite a plethora of publications, the literature is thin, with few well-designed studies that can provide a coherent picture of ecosystem values or policy effectiveness. Although ecologists coined the term ecosystem services and have led much of the recent research, ecosystem services is fundamentally an economic concept. This offers economists a unique and important opportunity to contribute to the emerging literature on ecosystem valuation and policy effectiveness. Most importantly, we conclude that the most fruitful path for future inquiry is to more tightly integrate policy and research by conducting studies that combine nonmarket valuation and impact evaluation (i.e., valuation estimates based on observed impacts in the context of real-world programs). We believe that investing scarce research funds in such an integrated approach will increase the likelihood that future research on ecosystem services will yield high-quality evidence of practical use to policymakers.","[Ferraro, Paul J.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Lawlor, Kathleen] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Mullan, Katrina L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Ctr Int Forestry, Bogor, Indonesia",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Duke University,"Ferraro, PJ (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",subhrendu.pattanayak@duke.edu,"Ferraro, Paul/B-4435-2014","Ferraro, Paul/0000-0002-4777-5108; Mullan, Katrina/0000-0003-0906-9269",,,,,103,89,101,3,142,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

The main modules are each calibrated with data on relevant indicators, such as the incidences of extreme poverty, socioeconomic vulnerability, demography, and historical drought, cyclone and flood patterns. The results suggest likely changes in population densities across Bangladesh due to migration from the drought-prone western districts and areas vulnerable to cyclones and floods in the south, towards northern and eastern districts.

This article investigates the transaction networks of two large sectors in Japan at a single point in time. In characterizing these networks, our primary measure is hierarchy, defined as the degree to which transactions flow in one direction, from upstream to downstream. Our empirical results show that the electronics sector exhibits a much lower degree of hierarchy than the automotive sector because of the presence of numerous inter-firm transaction cycles. These cycles, in turn, reveal that a significant group of firms have two-way vertically permeable boundaries: (i) they participate in multiple stages of an industry's value chain, hence are vertically integrated, but also (ii) they allow both downstream units to purchase intermediate inputs from and upstream units to sell intermediate goods to other sector firms. We demonstrate that the 10 largest electronics firms had two-way vertically permeable boundaries while almost no firms in the automotive sector had adopted that practice.","[Luo, Jianxi; Whitney, Daniel E.; Magee, Christopher L.] MIT, Engn Syst Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Baldwin, Carliss Y.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University,"Luo, JX (通讯作者)，MIT, Engn Syst Div, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E38-450, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jluo@mit.edu; cbaldwin@hbs.edu; dwhitney@mit.edu; cmagee@mit.edu,"WHITNEY, DANIEL E./ABD-1595-2021; Luo, Jianxi/AAA-8002-2021","Luo, Jianxi/0000-0001-5892-8432",,,,,72,43,46,1,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This paper tests the hypothesis whether informal work is an alternative to workfare participation before a large-scale program expansion took place. Results from the propensity score matching indicate that observable characteristics of informal low-income workers and current workfare participants are significantly different. However, within these groups, it is possible to identify subgroups with similar observable characteristics. This indicates that only a subset of the individuals sees workfare and informal work as substitutable alternatives.","Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",Wesleyan University,"Khamis, M (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",mkhamis@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,,25,2,3,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Firms that operate both in the formal and informal sectors do very little to increase employment when faced with the opportunity of hiring workers in the informal labor market. Thus enforcement of labor laws and other regulations should not have aggregate employment effects, particularly when workers are productively homogeneous. For firms operating exclusively in the informal sector, the outcome is different. Such features determine the stringency of enforcement in a market characterized by firms with varying levels of productivity. For example, in the case of firms with relatively high levels of productivity, enforcement has to be stricter than in the case with relatively low productivity firms. Taxing the more productive seems to be the optimal strategy.","[Marjit, Sugata; Kar, Saibal] Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Marjit, Sugata] Univ Nottingham, Leverhulme Ctr Res Globalizat & Econ Policy, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Kar, Saibal] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Nottingham; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Marjit, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",marjit@gmail.com; saibal@cssscal.org,"Kar, Saibal/AAC-8174-2019","Kar, Saibal/0000-0001-8134-1517",,,,,17,7,8,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Seasonal adjustment is a powerful tool for removing such fluctuations. Meanwhile, seasonal adjustment may provide highly volatile series, as it deals with certain type of movements completed on seasonal frequencies. However, short term fluctuations occurring at non-seasonal frequencies are also possible. In the context of inflation, we propose a two-step methodology combining wavelet and band-pass filters and aiming at removing all short term fluctuations within a year This method yields much smoother series than seasonal adjustment provides.

In particular, we estimate the Euler equations associated with the gross housing returns inclusive of price appreciations and rents jointly for several metropolitan areas of the US. The representative agent has a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility. The rent growth is allowed to depend on the business cycle. When biannual data from 1978 to 2007 is used, the parameter estimates are reasonable, and the model is not rejected. Large standard errors indicate uninformative estimates. The implied price rent ratio time series averages are similar to the data; however the model misses the boom-bust pattern in the prices. The model significantly understates the average and the variance of the price appreciations. Results are robust to allowing housing consumption directly in the utility function or using the Epstein-Zin-Weil utility. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While the general framework of social benefits in the CEE countries is still defined by the state, more and more often the task of provision of social security is transferred to the private entities. Such privatization of social policy makes the need for protection mechanism and some state guarantees even stronger. It is still the state that is responsible for the final outcome of social security systems so that is why governments are directly providing or indirectly creating safety mechanisms built-in the private market mechanism used for social purposes. The paper surveys various types of the protection mechanisms in selected CEE countries that exist in the important and already most privatized element of the social security system the pension system. While describing the safety measures and possible guarantees, special attention is paid to the new forms that have been built up recently. The paper covers both mandatory and voluntary pension markets and identifies present and possible threats in the existing frameworks that can harm the social security. The paper concludes with general assessment and policy recommendations.","[Kawinski, Marcin; Stanko, Dariusz; Rutecka, Joanna] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Social Insurance, PL-02520 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Kawinski, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Social Insurance, PL-02520 Warsaw, Poland.",dariusz.stanko@gmail.com,"Stanko, Dariusz/B-4593-2012; Rutecka-Góra, Joanna/HGE-5696-2022","Rutecka-Góra, Joanna/0000-0002-2509-8599",,,,,38,4,4,1,36,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

It takes into account the implications of the shock impacts for selecting an appropriate common exchange rate arrangement. The SVAR variance decomposition and impulse response analyses strongly underscore the relative impacts of the global shocks over the regional ones. The findings imply that the world's two major currencies, the U.S. dollar and the euro, should figure highly in a GCC's common basket of currencies. Accordingly, a transitional movement to a more flexible exchange rate arrangement such as a basket peg may be desirable for these trade-dependent economies in the long run, as is argued in the optimal currency literature for developing countries.

The component GARCH-in-mean model is used to measure the time-varying risk premium in DIP and separates the permanent and transitory risks. The results show that the risk premium is significant in most countries studied in this analysis. This suggests that risk is an important part of modeling exchange rates and needs to be considered in both empirical and theoretical models.

Taylor rule deviations occur if the short term interest rate persistently deviates from an interest rate path consistent with the Taylor rule. It uses the behavior rational expectation exchange rate model, where the monetary policy is captured by a Taylor rule. The set of exchange rate fundamentals is constructed in two different ways. In the baseline specification only the traditional macro fundamentals are considered, whereas in the second specification Taylor rule deviations are included as well. This paper finds that Taylor rule deviations are important determinants of the exchange rate as the second specification fits the data much better than the baseline. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The focus is on where to locate pedestrian bridges to improve access to schools and health services. Priorities are assigned to potential bridges based on an index of relative importance derived through use of a spatial interaction model. Despite differences in the number of schools versus health care facilities, there is considerable similarity between the spatial distributions of high and low priority bridge sites. However, even if all potential bridges are built, pockets of poor accessibility remain unless additional service centers are located in these regions. The analytical approach outlined here can provide easy-to-update, system-wide information that could be incorporated into local planning processes to help government officials and the public-at-large assess the benefits of different infrastructure scenarios.

The goodness of fit of the different models has been compared along with a series of hypotheses about the performance of the specifications considering spatial relationships between observations. The case study for such analysis was the urban area of Santander (Spain). The models which considered spatial dependence between observations offered a greater degree of fit in a scenario showing strong spatial correlation in MLR residuals. The SEM model combined with a Queen-Contiguity matrix provided a good fit to the data and at the same time presented significant parameters with theoretically coherent signs. This model estimated increases of 1.8% for each additional transit line present in the areas of housing, as well as a reduction of 1.1% in their prices for each additional minute in travelling time to the Central Business District.

HSR networks are usually designed to interconnect strong economic centers efficiently. Hence, the greatest improvements in accessibility concentrate near HSR stations, whereas intermediate locations suffer from comparatively lower accessibility benefits. Negative territorial cohesion impacts appear if HSR ultimately results in a more polarized spatial distribution of accessibility levels. There has so far been little research aimed at exploring the implications of the definition of the geographical limits of study area in the measurement of HSR territorial cohesion impacts. In this context, this paper presents a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based methodology which analyzes changes in the territorial distribution of accessibility resulting from HSR investments. These changes are analyzed at different planning levels, in order to assess the sensitivity of territorial cohesion results to scale definition. The methodology is tested by its application to the development of the 670 km of the Galician (northwestern) HSR corridor included in the Spanish PEIT (Strategic Transport and Infrastructure Plan) 2005-2020. Cohesion impacts are assessed at different direct planning levels: regional, corridor and national levels, as well from the perspective of spillover effects. In all cases, the construction of the HSR corridor increases the accessibility values, and results show positive cohesion effects at the national and corridor levels, whereas at the regional level both balancing and polarization effects appear. These differences are mainly due to the location of HSR stations or to the quality of the transport network from the surrounding cities to the station, which determines the territorial distribution of accessibility improvements. Similar results are found from the spillover perspective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that the average effectiveness of teachers in high poverty schools is in general less than teachers in other schools and there is significantly greater variation in teacher quality among high poverty schools. These differences are largely driven by less productive teachers at the bottom of the teacher effectiveness distribution in high-poverty schools. The bulk of the quality differential is due to differences in the unmeasured characteristics of teachers. We find that the gain in productivity to more experienced teachers from additional experience is much stronger in lower-poverty schools. The lower return to experience in high-poverty schools does not appear to be a result of differences in the quality of teachers who leave teaching or who switch schools, however. Our findings suggest that measures that induce highly effective teachers to move to high-poverty schools and which promote an environment in which teachers' skills will improve over time are more likely to be successful.

In the second, sellers post a quantity only and let prices be determined ex post by realized demand, resulting in price dispersion. We show that while agents trade lower quantities when prices are dispersed (an intensive margin effect), they also trade more often (an extensive margin effect).

We interpret this statistic as a measure of a model's economic time variation across two periods. Estimating bounds for nominal and real SDFs at monthly and quarterly frequencies, we find that the admissible autocorrelations are significantly negative, but greater than -0.02, implying that the bounds impose a strong restriction on candidate SDFs. We illustrate the relevancy of these findings by showing that some widely used consumption-based models are misspecified with respect to the autocorrelation bound.

The paper addresses this issue by estimating a voting model that explains voters' decisions on eminent domain and police power reform referenda in the US. Estimates indicate that eminent domain referendum outcomes hinged on voters' fundamental values and ideology, and voters' immediate self-interest. Voters' fundamental values and ideology affects referendum outcomes insofar as educational attainment in a county has a statistically significant effect on support for reform. Despite the greater incidence of eminent domain in low income and poorer communities, success of reform referenda in this study was found to be greater in counties with higher incomes and lower unemployment rates. This implies that whatever asymmetry exists in the exercise of eminent domain law across income groups does not affect voter reaction to eminent domain reforms. Moreover, counties with high unemployment rates consider the larger potential benefits from urban renewal projects in vote decision-making providing a link between self-interest and voting behavior.

Therefore, it is the most 'efficient' form of compliance. We empirically test this hypothesis by employing panel data from 147 countries during the period of 2001-2009.

The standard range-statistic-routinely used in financial economics to estimate the variance of securities prices-is shown to be biased when the price process contains jumps. We outline how the new theory can be applied to remove this bias by constructing a hybrid range-based estimator. Our asymptotic theory also reveals that when high-frequency data are sparsely sampled, as is often done in practice due to the presence of microstructure noise, the range-based multipower variations can produce significant efficiency gains over comparable subsampled return-based estimators. The analysis is supported by a simulation study, and we illustrate the practical use of our framework on some recent Trade and Quote (TAQ) equity data.","[Christensen, Kim] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Podolskij, Mark] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Appl Math, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany",Aarhus University; CREATES; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Christensen, K (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Dept Econ & Business, Univ Pk,Bldg 1322, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",kchristensen@creates.au.dk,,"Podolskij, Mark/0000-0002-3302-2455",,,,,79,23,29,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

The concept of financial instability is referred to the state at which the financial system cannot fulfil its main functions and, therefore, negatively affects the performance of the real sector. Consequently, financial stability requires the use of instruments defined at the micro level in order to achieve macro objectives. This further necessitates reformulating both monetary policy instruments and existing instruments at the micro level that are used by the regulatory/supervisory authorities. This requires the abandonment of the traditional framework which envisages a division of labor between the central bank and the regulatory/supervisory authorities based on macro/micro distinction. The proposed new framework depends on a much stronger cooperation among these institutions.

In the dictator games we classify individuals' preferences as self-interested, inequity averse, efficiency maximizing, or compassionate social surplus maximizing. We find that the different utility functions of the social preference types guide participants' behavior in the ultimatum and trust games. The self-interested and efficiency maximizers make the lowest offers in the ultimatum game, are least likely to reject a low offer in the ultimatum game, and send back the least amount in the trust game. Consistent with the goal of maximizing the sum of payoffs however, efficiency maximizers and compassionate social surplus maximizers make the highest offers in the trust game, and in attempts to ensure equal outcomes, inequity averters make low offers. Because those classified as self-interested or efficiency maximizing do not exhibit concern for pure distributive fairness, we identify positive offers as first movers in both games as evidence of expectations of reciprocity by second movers and some choices as second movers as clear evidence of their own concerns for reciprocal fairness. Furthermore, we find strong evidence supporting general concern for reciprocal fairness in the trust games where the modal response of second movers in all preference groups is to equalize payments across participants.

The consideration of decision-makers who have ideological preferences yields in standard tax competition models the hypothesis that left-wing leaders set higher corporate tax rates. In the empirical analysis, we introduce an innovative measure of ideology derived from content analysis of party manifestos into the public finance literature. The results support our main hypothesis, but we also find evidence that the partisan effect declines in the course of time. Moreover, we are able to reveal that the observed effect is mainly driven by the legislatures' stance on welfare policies. Finally, we show that a higher degree of government fragmentation, as well as the leadership of a head of government with an educational background in law counteracts the general tendency to lower tax rates.

The results from empirical analyses show that the communities that received this program became better-off between 2000 and 2005, according to the marginalization level. Further analyses suggest that specifically investment in roads, water supply, and non-agricultural productive projects by the 3 x 1 program improved community welfare. The regression results on access to the program show, however, that neither the marginalization level nor the migration level determined the access to the program. This suggests that the 3 x 1 program was not necessarily targeted at the communities with higher marginalization and migration levels.","[Kijima, Yoko] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Gonzalez-Ramirez, Horacio] INIFAP, Durango 34170, Dgo, Mexico",University of Tsukuba,"Kijima, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",kijima@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp; gonzalez.horacio@inifap.gob.mx,"Kijima, Yoko/HJI-7875-2023","Kijima, Yoko/0000-0003-1568-1358",,,,,26,4,6,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Commodity markets may be characterized by concentration on the buyer side, with a small number of transnational intermediary firms purchasing from supplying countries and distributing to the market, and recent work has suggested that export taxes may be an optimal policy to recapture monopsony rent. However, in many commodity markets there are also a limited number of large supplying countries. This paper considers a situation where an oligopsonistic intermediary industry purchases from a small number of supplying countries, the governments of which act strategically in their policy choices both with respect to the intermediaries and any competing suppliers.

At present, sustainable urban freight management is often hampered by a lack of awareness, not only of the local regulatory contexts, but also regarding acceptability and operative constrains of various distribution-chain stakeholders. This paper presents findings from a project investigating innovative freight solutions in a multi-stakeholder setting in Rome's limited traffic zone focussing on local policy-makers, freight carries and retailers. The paper explores the responses of stakeholders in two consultation stages. Firstly, it examines the problem structure and policy sensitivity using in depth focus groups with stakeholders. Second, a survey with 195 operators is carried out to examine behavioural responses to policy innovation on behalf of carriers, retailers and own-account operators. Results point towards heterogeneity in policy acceptability and reveal different operator's stated reactions to innovative freight policies. The proposed empirical analysis considering multiple stakeholders points of view provides important inputs to improve freight policy design and analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that institutional investors with longer investment horizons have greater incentives and efficiencies to engage in effective monitoring. This improved monitoring mitigates asymmetric information and agency problems, and in turn reduces the wedge between the costs of internal and external funds. As a result, the sensitivity of firms' investment outlays to internal cash flows decreases in the presence of institutional investors with long-term investment horizons. Using a sample of 8402 US firms over the period 1981-2008, we provide empirical evidence consistent with these arguments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Market participants concerned about the credibility of information measures may require additional compensation to entice them to hold stocks with less transparent information. These same securities are expected to display greater sensitivities to measures of market sentiment. We find that investor sentiment sensitivities increase directly with multiple measures of opacity in the cross-section. Next we examine the extent to which sentiment sensitivities are priced in an asset pricing context. Using the Jha et al. (2009) model of conditional performance evaluation, we find an inverse relation between ex ante known investor sentiment and the marginal performance of opaque stocks.

It has three focal points. It discriminates between the preference for self-employment and actual involvement in self-employment using a two (probit) equation model. It makes a systematic distinction between different ways in which gender influences the preference for and actual involvement in self-employment (mediation and moderation). It includes perceived ability as a potential driver of self-employment next to risk attitude, self-employed parents and other socio-demographic drivers. A representative data set of more than 8000 individuals from 29 countries (25 EU Member States, US, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) is used (the 2004 Flash Eurobarometer survey).

The main empirical finding is the very limited evidence of commodity volatility breaks during the recent financial crisis. This suggests commodity return volatility was not exceptionally high during the recent financial crisis compared to the 1985-2010 sample period as a whole. For many commodities there are multiple idiosyncratic breaks in volatility; this suggests commodity specific supply or demand factors are important determinants of volatility. The empirical results overall are consistent with the view that commodities are too diverse to be considered as an asset class. Finally, we find commodity volatility persistence remains very high for many commodity returns even after structural breaks are accounted for. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although civic activism is a corrective, people have yet to make use of tax payment as a device to hold councilors accountable.

To test the model, we analyze all global financial firms with traded options in the US and focus on the subprime mortgage crisis period. We compare the performance of the implied probability of default from our model to the expected default frequencies based on the Moody's KMV model and agency credit ratings by constructing cumulative accuracy profiles (CAP) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). We find that the probability of default estimates from our model are equal or superior to other credit risk measures studied based on CAP and ROC. In particular, during the subprime crisis our model surpassed credit ratings and matched or exceeded KMV in anticipating the magnitude of the crisis.

Because these characteristics of inside debt expose the CEO to default risk similar to that faced by outside creditors, theory predicts that CEOs with large inside debt holdings will display lower levels of risk-seeking behavior (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Consistent with the theoretical predictions, we find a negative association between CEO inside debt holdings and the volatility of future firm stock returns, R&D expenditures, and financial leverage, and a positive association between CEO inside debt holdings and the extent of diversification and asset liquidity.

Utilizing data from a sample of more than 17,000 companies from 33 different countries, we find evidence in support of a significant worldwide decline in the propensity to pay dividends. Most of the decline is due to the payout policies of smaller and less profitable firms with comparatively more investment opportunities. We find that larger firms, those with higher profitability, and firms with low growth opportunities have a greater propensity to pay dividends. The proportion of dividend payers varies substantially across industries as well. However, the proportion of firms paying dividends has declined over time, even after firms' characteristics have been controlled for. Moreover, aggregate dividends are highly concentrated in that they are paid only by a small group of firms. Our findings indicate that there has been a significant decline in the average dividend payout ratios over the years. The decline in the mean dividend payout ratios as well as the proportion of payers is much more pronounced in civil law countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Wind and solar power have only recently reached significant levels of penetration in some countries, but they are expected to grow much during the next few decades, and contribute substantially to meeting future electricity demand, see e.g. European Commission (2011). Wind, photovoltaic (PV) solar and concentrated solar power (CSP) with no storage have non-controllable variability, partial unpredictability and locational dependency. These attributes make an analysis of their impacts on electricity generation system operation and design particularly interesting. This paper reviews how a strong presence of intermittent renewable generation will change how future power systems are planned, operated and controlled. The change is already noticeable in countries that currently have a large penetration of wind and solar production. The mix of generation technologies, and potentially market rules, will have to adapt to accommodate this presence. Regulatory adjustments might be needed to attract investment in well adapted technologies.

We provide results over real-valued and integer-valued imputation sets, and for all regular election periods from 1959 to date. It turns out that the Magic Formula is contained in eight out of 11 nucleoli over integer domains between 1959 and 1999, and that it comes very close to the nucleolus in two of the three remaining cases.

This phenomenon is labeled creative destruction, but it might more accurately be called destructive creation, given the driving role of creation in the process. We reverse the typical causal ordering, and ask whether destruction may drive creation. We argue that economic systems may get stuck in suboptimal equilibria due to path dependence, and that destruction may sweep away this inertia, and open the way for entrepreneurship. To test this idea, we need an exogenous destructive shock, rather than destruction that is endogenous to the process of economic progress. Our identification strategy relies on the September 11 attacks as an exogenous destructive shock to the economic system centered on New York City. Consistent with our theoretical claim, we find that 15 months after the attacks the rate of business founding close to New York City exceeds the rate before the attacks, even after controlling for the inflow of recovery funds. Furthermore, the increase in the business founding rate after the attacks grows faster closer to Manhattan than it does further away from the epicenter of destruction.","[Ingram, Paul] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Paruchuri, Srikanth] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Columbia University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Ingram, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sup28@psu.edu; pi17@columbia.edu,,,,,,,51,21,26,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Yet, the strength and efficacy of industry institutions to promote these collective interests, depends upon the active support and participation of member firms. This is essentially a collective action problem. By aligning Olson's (1971) logics of collective action framework with Nahapiet and Ghoshal's (1998) dimensions of social capital, this article uses survey data from 381 firms from across five UK manufacturing sectors to explore the factors that affect the propensity for firms to participate in industry institution led initiatives. The results suggest the propensity of firms participating in collective activities rises where shared interests emerge, although the over-riding factor is the extent to which firms perceive their own ability to influence and shape the direction of such activities (the logic of influence).","Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Tomlinson, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",P.R.Tomlinson@bath.ac.uk,"Tomlinson, Philip/AFJ-1113-2022","Tomlinson, Philip/0000-0001-6292-3204",,,,,64,17,18,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Participants were presented with a hypothetical three-condition scenario in which they imagined that they had submitted their application for admission to two universities. In the two conditions of certainty, the participants imagined that they were either accepted by University A or rejected by University A. In the uncertain condition, the participants imagined that they did not know whether they had been accepted or rejected by University A. These three conditions formed a disjunction condition. The results suggested that the participants felt less happy under the uncertain condition than under the two conditions of certainty, regardless of whether the information presentation was non-transparent (Experiment 1A) or transparent (Experiment 1B) and regardless of whether the options in the two conditions of certainty were similar (Experiment 2A) or substantially discrepant (Experiment 26 and Experiment 3). Experiment 3 further demonstrated that, consistent with the hedonic hypothesis, preferential choices (which constitutes a disjunction effect) are based on emotional responses in the disjunction condition.

We compare the performance of the EPA's mandatory refuges and a tax (or subsidy) on the pesticide variety under several biological assumptions on pest mobility and the heterogeneity of farmers' pest vulnerability. We find that only the tax (or subsidy) restores efficiency if pest mobility is perfect within the area. If pest mobility is imperfect and when farmers face identical pest vulnerability, only the refuge might restore efficiency. With simulations we illustrate that complex outcomes may arise for intermediate levels of pest mobility and farmers' heterogeneity. Our results shed light on the choice of regulatory instruments for common-pool resource regulations where spatial localization matters.","[Ambec, Stefan] Toulouse Sch Econ INRA LERNA, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Ambec, Stefan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Desquilbet, Marion] Toulouse Sch Econ INRA GREMAQ, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE; University of Gothenburg; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Ambec, S (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ INRA LERNA, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",stefan.ambec@toulouse.inra.fr; Marion.Desquilbet@toulouse.inra.fr,,,,,,,31,12,14,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Under some circumstances, unconscious thought improves decisions even more than conscious thought. Executive functioning depends on energy provided by glucose, and we know from previous research that the performance of various conscious processes deteriorates when energy is low. Unconscious processes require less energy and may operate unhampered when energy is low. Therefore, we propose that whereas low blood glucose levels impair conscious thought, this is not the same for unconscious thought. An experiment, where we manipulated blood glucose levels, indicated that indeed, when making decisions, the unconscious can best be trusted when blood glucose levels are low, whereas conscious deliberation yields the best results when blood glucose levels are elevated.","[Bos, Maarten W.; Dijksterhuis, Ap; van Baaren, Rick] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Behav Sci, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Bos, Maarten W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Radboud University Nijmegen; Harvard University,"Bos, MW (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Baker Lib 467, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",mbos@hbs.edu,,,,,,,56,14,16,0,17,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

It explains why the sugar sector was rehabilitated from the perspectives of Mozambican state, government and industry actors.

The purpose of this paper is to show that pubs are important facilitators of community cohesion and ultimately well-being of residents. This is done by compiling a database of secondary data at the parish level of rural communities of England. From this data, measures of community cohesion and social interaction are derived and correlated with the number of pubs within the parish. Pubs are found to be statistically significantly positively associated with community cohesion and social interaction. The paper goes on to construct regression and path models to relate the number of pubs and community cohesion and interaction to self-reported health as a proxy for well-being. Significant positive associations are again found.

Despite previous experiences and economists' advices, the EU leaders continued to rely on policies of budgetary cuts as the only way to reach fiscal consolidation. The sudden decrease in aggregate demand and in public investments in the mid-term has led to economic contraction, higher taxation and a diminished potential for growth in most European economies. On this background, this paper aims at showing that fiscal consolidation must not exacerbate the policies to reduce the government spending or the discretionary use of budget deficits. The paper also intends to show that financial stability requires a mix of macroeconomic policies aimed at limiting the discretionary actions of political actors in budget spending structures. By doing so, it should lead towards a sustainable management of the fiscal space over the economic cycle in order to increase the number of fiscal stimuli with the best possible effects on economic growth.

Although previous studies have shown that baseline happiness is significantly heritable, little research has considered molecular genetic associations with subjective well-being. We study the relationship between a functional polymorphism on the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and life satisfaction.

However, experts have reasoned that the quantity of resources is as important as the quality of spending. If resources are allocated efficiently, more could be achieved with the same resources. Ensuring an effective strategy and basis for prioritising crop research investments so as to improve productivity is a major challenge in Zambia and other African countries. This study investigates the economic returns of investment in crop research and sets priorities for research investment using the Dynamic Research Evaluation for Management (DREAM) model. The findings show that maize, soya beans, groundnuts, cotton, millet, sunflower and sorghum are the crops that should receive priority in terms of funding for research under the efficiency objective. However, the study showed that the allocation of financial resources towards crop research in Zambia is not aligned with the social and economic returns of that investment. Nonetheless, positive returns from crop research investments were obtained, which suggests that investing in crop research is worthwhile but that attention needs to be paid to the appropriate research priorities. This is critical for improved competitiveness in Zambian agriculture. The study recommends further investment in and robust prioritisation of crop research, complemented by improved infrastructure, institutions and markets for a thriving agricultural sector.","[Haankuku, C.; Kirsten, J.

The first variable is the non-residents' portfolio investment and the second variable is nominal exchange rate. At the end of Granger causality analysis, it is seen that non-residents' portfolio investment is causality of nominal exchange rate. Secondly, impulse-response analysis was performed and seen that nominal exchange rate initial reaction to shock in the non-residents' portfolio investment is negative and significant statistically. Finally, variance decomposition analysis was performed.

We estimated the value of this tax expenditure at approximately CZK 5 billion in 2009, with almost half the amount spent by the lowest two deciles in income distribution. Personal income tax reform is slated to begin in 2014, one part of which will be a cap on loan interest. This reform would lead to a decrease in the yearly value of the tax expenditure but will be followed by an increase in the PIT rate. Taken together, this will generate greater tax expenditures. Our computations show that the impact will be negative on households in the highest decile, while other groups will feel some benefit.","[Jahoda, Robert] Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,jahoda@econ.muni.cz; 174847@mail.muni.cz,"Jahoda, Robert/D-9180-2012",,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,WOLTERS KLUWER CR A S,PRAHA 3,"U NAKLADOVEHO NADRAZI 6, PRAHA 3, PRAGUE 130 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7478-012-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,111,121,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJP92,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329534700011,0

We hypothesize that certain contextual built environment features and station and right-of-way configurations will increase the walk-access catchment area; that is, that urban design influences users' willingness to walk to BRT. We base our analysis on 1233 user surveys, conducted at 19 BRT stations along three existing (as of summer 2009) BRT corridors in the city of Jinan. Ordinary least squares regression is applied to estimate the relationship between walk access distances and aggregate station- and corridor-area characteristics, controlling for individual- and trip-specific attributes. The results suggest that people walk farther to BRT stations when the walking environment has certain features (median transit-way station location, shaded corridors, busy and interesting). Trip and trip maker characteristics play a relatively minor role in defining BRT walk access distance. Implications include the need for flexible transit station catchment area definitions in identifying transit-oriented development opportunities and estimating system demand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is one of the effective ways of dealing with the multicollinearity problem especially arises in several econometric models. In situations when there are a large number of highly correlated explanatory variables, decomposition by PLSR can be used to select a small number of linear combinations of the original variables which explain the great amount of covariance between explanatory and response variables.

We divide the agricultural sector into four levels and expand the innovation system approach (Malerba 2002 and 2004, Koschatzky 2009) to study innovation processes.

For several specific types of housing (terrace, detached, semi-detached) there is a credit-price effect. We find much more evidence of a wealth effect in the developed states of Penang and Selangor. A likely explanation is that in these states, compared with the Malaysian average, housing is relatively expensive, income is relatively high and real estate is used much more as an investment vehicle by both wealthy Malaysians and foreigners.

Yet understanding public transit accessibility is important for encouraging mode shifts to reduce car reliance and is essential for the wellbeing of non-car households. The paper describes two measures of public transit access. The first is a combined public transit and walking accessibility index, which measures potential access to destinations via public transit and walking modes. The second is a transit frequency measure, which is a measure of transit service level in an area. These two measures extend current public transit accessibility measures by including all components of the public transit journey, calculating accessibility at the parcel level and providing a measure of public transit service. Results for the Auckland region show that although 94.4% of the urban population live in areas with medium-high public transit and walking access, only 26.5% of the urban population also have an average transit frequency of two or more trips per hour per stop. Moreover, only 5% of the urban population live in areas with an average transit frequency of more than four services per hour per stop. This work highlights the importance of including measures of transit frequency when investigating public transit access. The results also reveal the potential to use these measures to gain a more complete and realistic picture of public transit access and to explore the potential for mode substitution and accessibility for non-car households.

We highlight the importance of information in addressing the public desire for banks to be safe yet innovative. Regulators can choose several approaches to increase market discipline and information production. Information production can be mandated outside of markets through increased regulatory disclosure. Regulators can also directly motivate potential producers of information by changing their incentives. Traditional approaches to bank governance may interfere with the information content of prices. Thus, the lack of transparency in the banking industry may be a symptom rather than the primary cause of bad governance. We provide examples of compensation and resolution. Reforms that promote the quality of security prices through information production can improve the governance of financial institutions.

Starting from the consumer-centric view of the modern marketing, it can be stated that the main goal of IMC is affecting the consumer behaviour and implicitly its structural processes: perception, attitude, information, motivation and actual behaviour. Therefore, this study aims to identify the ways in which IMC could influence the consumer behaviour, starting from the hierarchy of effects concept, seen as a result of the whole IMC process, rather than only an outcome of advertising. The highlighting of the IMC impacts reflected in its effects on the consumer and further evidenced in the structure of consumer behaviour processes is made using a conceptual model built on this purpose.

The article deals with the projects promoting innovations in the rural areas of the Czech Republic (CR) financed from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Strategy Plans LEADER (SPL) submitted by Local Actions Groups (LAGs) which are operating under the LEADER(1) scheme are analysed and their approach towards innovation is evaluated. The importance of the innovations in the projects is evaluated on the basis of established preferential criteria for selection of the projects and finances devoted to the measure Fiche(2) which includes innovative projects. On the basis of case studies of the projects aimed on education I am coming to the conclusion that various types of projects are understood as innovative, but sometimes the term is misinterpreted. Preferential criteria for selecting projects defined by LAGs should be more precious and concrete. Despite the fact that innovations are one of the obligatory criteria for selecting projects which will be financed, its inclusion is mostly formal. Its relative weight in comparison with other criteria is quite low. Besides, the importance of innovative projects is not sufficiently underlined by finances. I argue that there is not adequate attention paid to the real contribution of the projects to innovations.

The empirical results of the one-dimensional backward multifractal detrended moving average MFDMA method confirm the multifractal nature of this emerging market and, implicitly, its predictable pattern. The two measures of the degree of market efficiency proposed by Wang et al. 2010 suggest that this predictability changes for different return frequencies.

In this study, three tests were applied to assert whether contextual unpredictability has a negative effect on preference for novel visual items. By asking subjects to rate their first impressions of novel brand logos while playing simple sounds, Study 1 shows that brand logos coupled to unpredictable sounds were rated less favorably than logos presented with a predictable sound. In Study 2, this effect is found to be equally strong for abstract art paintings. Finally, Study 3 demonstrates that the negative effect of unpredictable sounds on preference is associated with a stronger arousal response, as indexed by pupil dilation responses. These results suggest that unpredictable sounds engage an emotional response that affects the first impression of a concurrently presented visual object. We discuss these findings in light of the basic psychology and neuropsychology of preference formation.","[Ramsoy, Thomas Z.; Friis-Olivarius, Morten; Jacobsen, Catrine; Jensen, Simon B.; Skov, Martin] Copenhagen Business Sch, Decis Neurosci Res Grp, Dept Mkt, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Ramsoy, Thomas Z.; Friis-Olivarius, Morten; Skov, Martin] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Danish Res Ctr Magnet Resonance, Hvidovre, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; University of Copenhagen,"Ramsoy, TZ (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Decis Neurosci Res Grp, Dept Mkt, Solbjerg Plads 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",tzr.marktg@cbs.dk,"Jensen, Simon B/X-4063-2018; Ramsøy, Thomas Z/E-2849-2019; Jacobsen, Catrine/E-7326-2015","Jacobsen, Catrine/0000-0002-3862-464X",,,,,54,20,21,0,12,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The overall high profits in this sector attract politicians' interest and civil society activities from this reason. Theory requires the coordination of the financial sector taxation with the regulation of that sector, and analyses the effectiveness of introducing the bank levies, financial transaction taxes and financial activities taxes. This newly opens up the issue of value added tax and the existing exemption of financial services from that tax. Markets are moreover distorted by government subsidies for pension products, for interests on mortgage and other loans, as well as for housing savings schemes. Particularly strong distortions of this sort exist in the Czech Republic. Strong fiscal pressures are driving the financial sector reforms. The author recommends primarily the removal of insufficient taxation of financial services. Subsidies for financial services need to be repealed in two steps while financial services need to be temporarily subjected to the financial activities tax until these services are duly subject to value added tax in the EU. This does not preclude a major reform of value added tax, such as the transition to income type VAT; this would create a completely different situation.","[Vostatek, Jaroslav] Univ Finance & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Prague 10, Czech Republic",,,jaroslav.vostatek@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,WOLTERS KLUWER CR A S,PRAHA 3,"U NAKLADOVEHO NADRAZI 6, PRAHA 3, PRAGUE 130 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7478-012-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,318,328,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJP92,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329534700031,0

We exploit information on firms' access to banking debt and changes in the real exchange rate (RER) to identify the causal effect of finance on exporting. This is an interesting case to study. The Chilean economy experienced a sustained RER depreciation since 1999, which increased export profitability. We use this episode as a quasi-experiment to study the impact of access to banking finance on exporting. Our results show that RER depreciations increase the probability of exporting for firms with access to banking finance and especially for firms in industries with higher financial needs. These results are robust to controlling for other firm characteristics affecting the probability of exporting and also for time varying industry-specific shocks that may affect export performance and banking finance.","[Alvarez, Roberto] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ricardo A.] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA USA",Universidad de Chile; Brandeis University,"Alvarez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",robalvar@fen.uchile.cl; rlopez@brandeis.edu,,,,,,,19,6,7,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We find that stock returns exhibit strong loss dependence even in their limiting joint extremes. Motivated by this result, we derive extremal dependence-based systemic risk indicators. The proposed systemic risk indicators reflect downturns in the US financial industry very well. We also develop a set of firm-level average extremal dependence measures. We show that these firm-level measures could have been used to identify the firms that were more vulnerable to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Additionally, we explore the performance of selected systemic risk indicators in predicting the crisis performance of large US depository institutions and find that the average stock return correlations are also good predictors of crisis period returns. Finally, we identify factors predictive of extremal dependence for the US depository institutions in a panel regression setting. Strength of extremal dependence increases with asset size and similarity of financial fundamentals. On the other hand, strength of extremal dependence decreases with capitalization, liquidity, funding stability and asset quality. We believe the proposed indicators have the potential to inform the prudential supervision of systemic risk.

The idea is that firms with a taxable income slightly above the kink have an incentive to reduce their income to bunch at the kink, and increasing investment is one possible strategy for that. This means that bunching of firms should be accompanied by a spike in investment at the kink. Building on the standard bunching framework, I estimate the frequency distribution of firms around the kink and the share of bunchers with excess investments at the extensive and intensive margins. I apply this approach to administrative tax return data for the universe of UK firms from 2001 to 2007 and show that investment by small firms responds significantly to a tax rate change. I find large and significant spikes in the share of capital investors and median capital costs at the 10,000 pound kink. The spikes are larger in 2002-05, when the kink is larger, and for quickly depreciating capital items, which yield larger tax reductions. Different pieces of evidence suggest that the investment spikes are at least partly driven by avoidance and evasion behaviour such as misreporting and claiming capital allowances for personal-use items.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Brockmeyer, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",abrockmeyer@worldbank.org,,,,,,,22,8,8,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

The model matches the unconditional averages of the price-rent ratios from 1978 to 2012 quite well; however, the model valuations after 2002 are well below the market price-rent ratios. We explore three mechanisms to understand these housing overvaluations in the post-2002 period relative to the consumption-based model: (1) using cross-sectional subprime consumer and commercial lending characteristics; (2) transaction costs; and (3) turning off the pro-cyclicality of the rent growth in the data.

We find strong evidence that mutual funds herd into or out of stocks following the herd of hedge funds: mutual funds' herding measure is positively related to last quarter's hedge fund herding. In contrast, hedge funds do not follow mutual funds. Mutual funds' following of hedge funds leads to a sharp price reversal in the next quarter, whereas hedge fund herding itself does not destabilize prices. Further, a mutual fund's following intensity increases with its past performance. The top 30% of mutual funds most active in following hedge funds do so persistently and drastically increase their herding subsequent to intense herding by hedge funds. They are also the group driving the above price reversals. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the reputational incentives of mutual fund herding and the associated price destabilization effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our simulations show that the complete abolishment of SAs would increase the average annual working hours of all wives by 1.6% only, which is smaller than previous findings in the Japanese literature. If we focus on households benefiting from SAs, the rate of increase in the wife working hours is even smaller (.1%). In addition, one particular case of SA reduction leads to a decrease in the labor supply of wives. We argue that these unexpected results are due to our explicit consideration of the fixed cost of labor market participations, which has been previously ignored in the Japanese studies. J.

We ask whether the self-employed express their social responsibility to society by giving more to charity than the general population, and if so which charitable causes they give to. We use social identity theory to generate hypotheses about the determinants and objectives of charitable giving among members of this socially and economically important group. Testing these hypotheses with nationally representative, longitudinal US data, we find that the American self-employed are indeed more likely to exhibit social responsibility toward their community by giving to charities than the general population. While the self-employed support broadly similar charities to the general population, they give substantially more to organizations which: address issues in the local community; provide health care; and serve the needy.

This paper deals with the public debt and output dynamic consequences of this strategy. To this end, we develop a simple macroeconomic model of the Euro area, where fiscal multiplier is time-varying. Recent empirical evidence has indeed shown that fiscal multipliers were higher in time of crisis. We then analyze the ability of EMU countries to comply with the new fiscal rules on public debt. The path of public debt and output gap is simulated according to different hypotheses related to fiscal multiplier, monetary policy and hysteresis effects. Not all EMU countries would be able to reach a 60% debt-to-GDP ratio in 2032. An alternative strategy may be to spread austerity in order to report part of consolidation to periods where the fiscal multiplier will be weaker. The gain of spreading austerity may yet be partly offset by higher risk premium. There is then a need to find institutional arrangements to avoid panics in the sovereign debt markets. Finally, it is shown that it would not be very efficient to implement an expansionary fiscal policy in Germany in order to balance austerity in the Euro area. Since output gap is nearly closed in Germany, the multiplier effect of a positive fiscal stance would be low and spillover effects would not be significant.","[Blot, Christophe; Cochard, Marion; Ducoudre, Bruno; Schweisguth, Danielle; Timbeau, Xavier] OFCE Sci Po Ctr Rech Econ Sci Po, Paris, France; [Creel, Jerome] OFCE Sci Po, Paris, France",,"Blot, C (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po Ctr Rech Econ Sci Po, Paris, France.",christophe.blot@sciencespo.fr,,"DUCOUDRE, Bruno/0000-0001-9799-0394",Socialists & Democrats Parliamentary Group at the European Parliament,Socialists & Democrats Parliamentary Group at the European Parliament,"Some parts of this paper draw on a larger project, iAGS, and benefited of funding from the Socialists & Democrats Parliamentary Group at the European Parliament.

This paper develops an endogenous growth model with a renewable resource and analyzes the possibly non-sustainable growth as a steady state, in spite of the household being deeply concerned with all its future lifetime utility. Our analysis shows that the ignorance of future lifetimes in present decision-making is indeed crucial to economic non-sustainability. We then examine whether a deforestation tax set by the government could have reduced the resource exploration rate and thereby held back the economic collapse.

The objectives of the study are identifying the level of attractiveness of Romania for international hotel chains, establishing the options of penetration chosen by them and the main influence factors upon the penetration on the market. The decision made by a hotel company to carry out its activity in a foreign country and the penetration strategy into the market can be motivated by many reasons. The study revealed that Romania ranks 24 out of 27 in terms of the opportunities of American international hotel chain that wants to enter the market. Analysing the 20 international hotel chains present on the Romanian market was found that the preferred penetration strategy is contract management. Research has indicated that the country of origin of the international hotel chain, chain size, the number of hotel stars belonging to a chain and the hotel establishment year has a statistically significant influence upon the strategy used to penetrate Romanian hotel market.","[Cosma, Smaranda; Fleseriu, Cristina; Bota, Marius] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Cosma, S (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",smaranda.cosma@tbs.ubbcluj.ro,"Fleseriu, Cristina/AAX-5584-2020; Cosma, Smaranda Adina/AAX-8447-2020; Bota, Marius/HZL-7192-2023; Bota, Marius/AAY-1709-2020","Fleseriu, Cristina/0000-0003-1479-1790; Bota, Marius/0000-0002-0821-4594;",,,,,38,3,3,0,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1352,1365,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900024,0

We reveal that the default risk exercises a causal effect on the equity price index during the high risk regime. This is found to prevail over the periods prior to the enactment of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) (1984-1992) and from the start of the crisis until the introduction of the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP) (late 2007-2008). This effect is attributed to bank dividends. During the period from the introduction of PCA until the outburst of the crisis (1992-late 2007) and during the post TARP period (2009-2011), there is no default risk effect on equity prices. PCA and TARP have altered the default risk - equity prices relation by eliminating the impact of dividends on default risk.

This policy disqualified 60 out of the 207 incumbent legislators from running for election again. Using a difference-in-differences approach with panel data on all electoral constituencies in Pakistan, I find that this ballot access restriction does not affect political competition across all constituencies with disqualified incumbents equally. Stronger political competition is defined as a larger number of candidates contesting election, a smaller vote share and vote margin for the winning candidate, and a less concentrated candidate field, as measured by a Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) of vote shares. Competition declined significantly in constituencies where the disqualified incumbent belonged to a small party and where literacy levels were lower (signifying a smaller pool of substitute candidates). However, political competition increased in areas where the disqualified incumbent was stronger in terms of his winning vote margin.","Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Afzal, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",mafzal@umd.edu,,,,,,,16,11,14,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2014,161.0,1-2,,,,,51,72,,10.1007/s11127-013-0126-2,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AN4BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340532400004,0

Indeed, older workers, with only a few years left before retirement, are particularly vulnerable to unexpected falls in stock prices. Despite the theoretical and - as shown by the recent financial crisis - policy relevance of the issue, empirical evidence on this topic has been scant and inconclusive. The aim of the present paper is to assess the effect of age on portfolio choices, using a new panel dataset from an Italian defined-contribution pension plan. We find that on average holdings of risky assets do indeed significantly decrease with age. However, the effect is non-linear, being much stronger in the last part of one's career.

Hence, in fisheries with large natural variability, a constant-escapement policy is a good approximation of the optimal policy.","[Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria] RGEA Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Vigo 36200, Spain; [Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria] ITAM, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Nostbakken, Linda] Norwegian Sch Econ NHH, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Perez, Marcos] Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Vigo 36200, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Universidade de Vigo,"Da-Rocha, JM (通讯作者)，RGEA Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Campus Univ Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36200, Spain.",jmrocha@uvigo.es; linda.nostbakken@nhh.no; marcos.perez@uvigo.es,"Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/Y-7181-2018; Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/CAJ-5410-2022; Gutiérrez, María-José/C-1141-2009; Pérez, Marcos Pérez/HZJ-0582-2023","Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/0000-0003-3985-8816; Gutiérrez, María-José/0000-0003-3074-0854; /0000-0002-4339-5095",,,,,18,9,9,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

An estimate of the effect on housing prices is given for each of the major events that occur under a typical Superfund remediation. After controlling for confounding correlated unobservables, I find a 7.3 % increase in sales price for houses within 3 km of a site that moves through the complete Superfund program.

The increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio is smaller if the finance minister stays in office for an additional year. This result is robust to the inclusion of the personal characteristics of prime ministers and a measure of political stability. However, the magnitude of the effect is sensitive to how finance ministers are selected in the econometric model when more than one minister holds office during a particular year. The estimation of interaction terms further reveals that experience particularly matters in election years or in times of negative GDP growth because an experienced finance minister has the power to restrict the usual increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio. In contrast, a finance minister's educational background and ideological leaning have no significant impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio.","ZEW Mannheim, Ctr European Econ Res, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Moessinger, MD (通讯作者)，ZEW Mannheim, Ctr European Econ Res, L7, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",moessinger@zew.de,,,,,,,44,24,27,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2014,161.0,1-2,,,,,183,207,,10.1007/s11127-013-0147-x,0.0,,,25,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AN4BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340532400011,0

J,"Wu, JH; Nash, C; Wang, D",,,,"Wu, Jianhong; Nash, Chris; Wang, Dong",,,Is high speed rail an appropriate solution to China's rail capacity problems?,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,High speed rail; China; Capacity,,"This paper addresses the question of whether the construction of new high speed lines is the most cost efficient way of solving the rail capacity problems of China. China has the most heavily used rail network in the world and rail traffic has doubled in the last 10 years. Rail continues to have a major share of both passenger and freight markets. The need for a large increase in rail capacity seems clear. If volumes are high enough, there is an argument that system efficiency is maximised by segregating freight and passenger traffic in order to eliminate conflicts between the two and thus maximise capacity utilisation. In Europe this has often been achieved by building new high speed lines for passenger traffic, and leaving existing lines to freight and regional passenger services. It is argued that if a new line has to be constructed, then it is worth the additional cost of providing for high speeds for the extra benefits this brings. This philosophy has been adopted for much of the new construction in China, including the crucial 1300 km Beijing Shanghai line. But it has been very controversial. It is argued that in Chinese conditions high speed rail is very much more expensive to build than conventional rail. Its construction has led to the Ministry of Railways becoming very heavily in debt, whilst to try to ease the problem high speed rail fares have been set at three times those on conventional rail, reducing the relief to capacity problems by leaving substantial passenger traffic on the existing routes. China, despite its astonishing economic growth in recent decades, remains a relatively poor country and values of time remain low by European standards; moreover they differ enormously between regions. This paper shows that, at existing Chinese values of time, new conventional lines are generally a better solution to Chinese railway capacity problems than high speed rail. Whilst a limited amount of high speed rail construction in the richest and most densely populated parts of the country may be justified, in a country as large and diverse as China, regional differences must be taken into account in determining the appropriate rail investment policy.

We develop a network approach to the amplification of financial contagion due to the combination of overlapping portfolios and leverage, and we show how it can be understood in terms of a generalized branching process. This can be used to compute the stability for any particular configuration of portfolios. By studying a stylized model we estimate the circumstances under which systemic instabilities are likely to occur as a function of parameters such as leverage, market crowding, diversification, and market impact. Although diversification may be good for individual institutions, it can create dangerous systemic effects, and as a result financial contagion gets worse with too much diversification. There is a critical threshold for leverage; below it financial networks are always stable, and above it the unstable region grows as leverage increases. Note that our model assumes passive portfolio management during a crisis; however, we show that dynamic deleveraging during a crisis can amplify instabilities. The financial system exhibits robust yet fragile behavior, with regions of the parameter space where contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it occurs. Our model and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and provide simple yet powerful tools for macroprudential stress testing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We also find evidence that politics matters, with Republican appointees being much more focused on inflation stabilization than Democratic appointees.

We study three events: IPO lockup expirations, option introductions, and the 2008 short-sale ban on financial firms. Consistent with our prediction, we show that when short-sale constraints are relaxed, event stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility tend to experience greater price reductions, as well as larger increases in trading volume and short interest, than those with low idiosyncratic volatility. These results hold when we benchmark event stocks with non-event stocks with comparable idiosyncratic volatility.

Our econometric estimates indicate that the positive effects of scientific publications and university graduates are confined within the boundaries of the province in which universities are located. Conversely, the creation of new KIFs in a focal province is positively affected by both local and external university knowledge codified in academic patents, even though the positive effect of this external knowledge rapidly diminishes with geographic distance. Furthermore, the above effects are confined to high-quality universities; low-quality universities have little effect on KIF creation.","[Bonaccorsi, Andrea; Guerini, Massimiliano] Univ Pisa, DESTEC, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Colombo, Massimo G.; Rossi-Lamastra, Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20156 Milan, Italy",University of Pisa; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Guerini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, DESTEC, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.",a.bonaccorsi@gmail.com; massimo.colombo@polimi.it; massimiliano.guerini@polimi.it; cristina1.rossi@polimi.it,"; Guerini, Massimiliano/E-9361-2017","Colombo, Massimo G./0000-0003-0373-1565; Guerini, Massimiliano/0000-0003-2812-0779",,,,,83,50,52,5,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In the environment that has prevailed for at least three decades now, it is not possible to understand business fluctuations and the corresponding analytical and policy challenges without understanding the financial cycle. This calls for a rethink of modelling strategies and for significant adjustments to macroeconomic policies. This essay highlights the stylised empirical features of the financial cycle, conjectures as to what it may take to model it satisfactorily, and considers its policy implications.

In order to manage this ambidexterity, technology transfer offices (TTOs) were established in most universities. This paper studies a specific, often implemented, but rather understudied type of TTO, namely a hybrid TTO model uniting centralized and decentralized levels. Employing a qualitative research design, we examine how and why the two TTO levels engage in diverse boundary spanning activities to help nascent spin-off companies move through the pre-spin-off process. Our research identifies differences in the types of boundary spanning activities that centralized and decentralized TTOs perform and in the parties they engage with. We find geographical, technological and organizational proximity to be important antecedents of the TTOs' engagement in external and internal boundary spanning activities. These results have important implications for both academics and practitioners interested in university technology transfer through spin-off creation.","[Huyghe, Annelore; Knockaert, Mirjam; Wright, Mike] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Knockaert, Mirjam] Univ Oslo, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Oslo, Norway; [Wright, Mike] Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Piva, Evila] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Ghent University; University of Oslo; Imperial College London; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Huyghe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",annelore.huyghe@ugent.be; mirjam.knockaert@ugent.be; m.wright@imperial.ac.uk; evila.piva@polimi.it,"Huyghe, Annelore/HKE-7455-2023","Wright, Douglas/0000-0001-7762-8785; Knockaert, Mirjam/0000-0002-7738-8838",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,71,57,60,2,129,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

When the need for VC advice and support calls for a high-powered outside claim, the entrepreneur should optimally retain control in order to avoid undue interference. Hence, I predict that more high-powered claims should be associated with fewer control rights. This challenges the idea that control should always be attached to equity-like claims and is in line with contractual terms used in venture capital, corporate venturing, and partnerships between biotech start-ups and large corporations. The article also rationalizes evidence that venture capital contracts include contingencies triggering both a reduction in VC control and the automatic conversion of VC's preferred stock into common.","[Cestone, Giacinta] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, CSEF, London, England",City University London,"Cestone, G (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, CSEF, London, England.",,,"Cestone, Giacinta/0000-0002-3667-7895",,,,,47,10,11,7,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We use annual wind power generation to capture the stringency of the portfolio of demand-pull policies in place (e.g., guaranteed tariffs, investment and production tax credits), and patent data as an indicator of innovation activity. We find that wind technology improvements respond positively to policies both home and abroad, but the marginal effect of domestic policies is 12 times greater. The influence of foreign polices is reduced by barriers to technology diffusion, in particular lax intellectual property rights. Reducing such barriers therefore constitutes a powerful policy leverage for boosting environmental innovation globally.","[Dechezlepretre, Antoine] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Glachant, Matthieu] MINES ParisTech, CERNA, F-75006 Paris, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Glachant, M (通讯作者)，MINES ParisTech, CERNA, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France.",glachant@ensmp.fr,,,"ESRC [ES/I015760/1, ES/K006576/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I015760/1, ES/H02123X/1, ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,44,96,103,3,91,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The empirical design uses MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) Islamic equity index since it applies stringent restrictions to include companies. Indeed, two main restrictions must be met: (i) the business activity must be compliant with Shari'ah (i.e., Islamic law) guidelines and (ii) interest-bearing investments and leverage ratios should not exceed upper limits. Three models are used: multivariate GARCH BEKK, CCC, and DCC. The estimation results of the three models show that the US and Islamic emerging equity markets are weakly correlated over time. No sheer evidence supports that the US market spills over into the Islamic emerging equity markets. Besides interpreting the results in terms of weak market integration, the peculiar specificities of the Islamic finance industry and the admittance conditions to the MSCI Islamic equity index contribute to explaining them. Indeed, Islamic finance bans interest-bearing investments and imposes some rules, such as asset-backing, which has sizeable impacts on volatility spillover and shocks transmissions, alongside with the close linkage between real and financial sectors. These findings suggest that investors should take caution when investing in the Islamic emerging equity markets and diversifying their portfolios in order to minimize risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

By applying panel data analysis on a set of 40 countries from 1998 to 2005, sufficient evidence for this negative relationship is provided, using three different measures of stock market volatility. Therefore, moving towards monetary policy transparency is recommended as stock market volatility can be reduced considerably, implying significant benefits for financial stability.

Findings from empirical investigation of the British Household Panel Survey (1993-2009) identify comparable overall time-use (combined commutes, working hours/overtime, housework, and (ill/elderly) care) between genders, however the distributions are distinct. Women report shorter commutes and working hours/overtime, but lengthy housework. Among men lengthier commutes generate dissatisfaction, while the presence of dependent children reduces satisfaction with leisure indicative of the impact of chauffeuring. Women's relationship with travel-to-work appears more complex. Women remain car dependent. Meanwhile, both short and long commutes generate dissatisfaction. Findings indicate short commutes among mothers which reduce satisfaction with leisure time, reflecting multi-activity journeys including the school run. The evidence is indicative of inequality in the household division of labour limiting women's temporal and spatial flexibility and reducing satisfaction with leisure time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Bank monitoring and resulting revocations help control illiquidity-seeking behavior of firms insured by credit lines. The cost of credit lines is thus greater for firms with high liquidity risk, which in turn are likely to use cash instead of credit lines. We test this implication for corporate liquidity management by identifying exogenous shocks to liquidity risk of firms in corporate bond and equity markets.

The present experiment sought to explore moral hazard in a laboratory setting. Participants made choices between certain and risky rewards. On some trials, participants bore the full brunt of a loss if the risky reward was chosen and lost. On other trials, participants believed losses would be shared with another party creating the opportunity for moral hazard. Our design allowed us to measure whether the presence of a moral hazard influenced participants' choice behavior and to quantify the magnitude of this influence. Results suggested that participants were more tolerant of risk when they believed losses would be shared with another party compared to choices when all of the loss would be experienced personally. More importantly, concern for the third party losses appeared to exert no influence on choices whatsoever. These results were found when the third party was anonymous (Experiment I) but also when they met the third party face-to-face (Experiment 2). The relationship between the current results and real-life moral hazards, as well as possible future research directions, is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Concerns about potential spillovers generate strategic interaction, triggering a pre-emption game in which one tries to exit the market before others to avoid spillovers. Although financial contagion originates in weaker institutions, systemic risk can critically depend on financial health of stronger in the contagion chain.

Moreover, many U.S. consumption tax advocates have insisted on direct personalized taxes that are unlike taxes used anywhere in the world. This article details a tax reform plan that uses revenues from a VAT to substantially reduce and reform our nation's tax system. The plan would (1) enact a destination-based VAT; (2) use the revenue produced by this VAT to finance an income tax exemption of $100,000 of family income and to lower income tax rates on income above that amount; (3) lower the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent; and (4) protect low-and-moderate-income workers from a tax increase through payroll tax credits and expanded refundable child tax credits. This revenue and distributionally neutral plan would stimulate economic growth, free more than 150 million Americans from having to file income tax returns, solve the difficult problems of international income taxation, and remove the temptation for Congress to use tax benefits as if they are solutions to the nation's pressing social and economic problems.","Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Graetz, MJ (通讯作者)，Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",michael.graetz@law.columbia.edu,,,,,,,35,5,5,0,16,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The main result is that the local governments seem to be less efficient in the management of the execution process, as they suffer from longer delays than the central government. This phenomenon was more severe for small municipalities and when the contract was mainly financed with external resources.

The latter variation implies that selection of appropriate forecasting methods should be a conditional exercise.","[Taylor, Nicholas] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Taylor, N (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",taylorn@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,5,6,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

This paper examines industry-specific 'attractiveness' due to changes in the transportation network for 23 counties in the Appalachian Region. The network improvements result from new highway construction and the proposed America 2050 High-Speed Rail (HSR) plan for the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion. The impacted counties that are proximate to five HSR stations (Birmingham, Atlanta, Greenville, Charlotte, and Greensboro) are studied for potential accessibility changes between the years 2002 to 2035. The impacts are examined with respect to six key industry sectors found around the proposed HSR stations: manufacturing; retail; construction; mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction; health-care services; and all other remaining industries combined. The analysis shows that, for transportation improvements with highways only (and no HSR), a decrease in accessibility for all the impacted counties occurs for the six industry sectors examined in the future year of 2035. The HSR speed of 150 miles per hour is found to be adequate enough to cause positive changes in potential accessibility of the directly impacted counties containing the Birmingham and Greenville HSR stations. With combined transportation network improvements from both highway construction and the new 150 mph HSR line, counties around the Atlanta and Greensboro HSR stations would see accessibility increases in 2035 compared to 2002 with respect to five industry sectors: manufacturing; retail; construction; health-care services; and all other remaining industries combined. However, accessibility changes with respect to mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction would be positive specifically only for the indirectly impacted counties around the Atlanta HSR station and the county containing the Greenville HSR station. This clearly shows differences in the spatial distribution of attractiveness for different industry sectors across the impacted counties along the HSR corridor. Thus, this exploratory analysis could serve as an aid to proactive public policy decision-making for large-scale transportation network improvements, such as the HSR, in understanding and improving economic activities for different industry mixes across other regions of the United States.

Though the number of varieties in a given country rises, many models predict that global variety decreases as imported varieties drive out local varieties. This is potentially worrisome when consumers care about non-exported foreign varieties as a result of tourism (especially when foreign varieties are highly desired). Since lowering trade costs induces additional firms to export and drives out some non-exported varieties, these modifications result in welfare losses not accounted for in the existing literature. Nevertheless, improvements in non-tourism consumption outweigh any such losses.","[Cole, Matthew T.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Davies, Ronald B.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University College Dublin,"Davies, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland.",matcole@fiu.edu,"Davies, Ronald/AAT-4531-2021","Davies, Ron/0000-0002-9738-9256",,,,,22,2,2,3,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In this paper, we examine the effect of access to debt markets on investment decisions by using debt ratings to indicate bond market access. We find that rated firms are more likely to undertake acquisitions than nonrated firms. This finding remains even after accounting for firm characteristics, for the probability of being rated, and in matched sample analysis as well as in subsamples based on leverage, firm size, age and information opacity. Rated firms also pay higher premiums for their targets and receive less favorable market reaction to their acquisition announcements relative to nonrated firms. However, the average announcement returns to rated acquirers are non-negative. Collectively, these findings suggest that the lack of debt market access has a real effect on the ability to make investments as well as on the quality of these investments by creating underinvestment, instead of simply constraining overinvestment.

In this context, the robustness of network infrastructures, e.g. air transport networks, are a central issue in transport geography. Disruption of communication links by intentional causes (e.g., terrorist attack on an airport) or unintentional (e.g., weather inclemency) could be crucial for countries, regions and even the airlines affected themselves. Policymakers and the management of airlines and alliances should be able to reduce the effects of such interruptions in order to ensure good communication through air transport (i.e., maximize the robustness of their network at a reasonable cost). The literature review of the study of air transport route networks through an analysis of complex networks has highlighted a lack of contributions to the study of the topology and the robustness of such networks which contrasts, with advances undertaken for other transport networks or communication systems. This survey suggests areas in which research should be undertaken, based on the existing literature in other areas and from three different perspectives: global route networks, airline alliances, airlines and airports so as to help towards a better understanding of air traffic and, therefore, to be able to assess the potential damage of any airport being inoperative for a continent, country or airline.

The results of this study strongly suggest that the industry as a whole has achieved a minimum efficient scale of operations. However, cross price elasticity estimates indicate that many rigidities exist in the input markets, particularly with respect to outsourced intermediate products.

The South African side of the Limpopo River, which marks its border with Zimbabwe, is populated with large-scale fruit and vegetable farms that are heavily dependent on temporary labour. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted on a border farm in 2009-10, the paper explores how Zimbabwean managers are central to the control of labour in this area. As the interface between the farm owner and the mass of temporary workers, managers are tasked with containing the instability attendant upon the employment of a highly fluid and disaffected workforce. The expansive and many-faceted role of black managers both disrupts and reproduces the circuits of paternalistic power. The potential for benevolence within paternalism is minimized, while the scope for arbitrary decision-making by owners and management remains largely intact.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Anthropol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Addison, L (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Anthropol, 131 George St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",lincolnaddison@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,10,11,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

However, decision makers may actually consider multiple criteria when evaluating projects. We consider a dual criteria model from psychology. This model integrates the familiar tradeoffs between risk and utility that economists traditionally assume, allowance for rank-dependent decision weights, and consideration of income thresholds. We examine the issues involved in full maximum likelihood estimation of the model using observed choice data. We propose a general method for integrating the multiple criteria, using the logic of mixture models, which we believe is attractive from a decision-theoretic and statistical perspective. The model is applied to observed choices from a major natural experiment involving intrinsically dynamic choices over highly skewed outcomes. The evidence points to the clear role that income thresholds play in such decision making, but does not rule out a role for tradeoffs between risk and utility or probability weighting.

The analysis is based on a microsimulation model and a rich data set that combines household survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) and process-produced microdata from the German pension insurance. We account for cohort effects in individual employment and unemployment affecting earnings over the life cycle as well as the differential impact of recent pension reforms. For individuals born between 1937 and 1971, cohort effects vary greatly by region, gender and education, and strongly affect life cycle earnings profiles. The largest effects can be observed for younger cohorts in East Germany and for the low educated. Using simulated life cycle employment and income profiles, we project gross future pensions across cohorts taking into account changing demographics and recent pension reforms. Simulations show that pension levels for East German men and women will fall dramatically among younger birth cohorts, not only because of policy reforms but also due to higher cumulated unemployment. For West German men, the small reduction of average pension levels among younger birth cohorts is mainly driven by the impact of pension reforms, while future pension levels of West German women are increasing or stable due to rising labour market participation of younger birth cohorts.","[Geyer, Johannes] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Steiner, Viktor] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin,"Geyer, J (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",jgeyer@diw.de; viktor.steiner@fu-berlin.de,"Geyer, Johannes/AAC-4919-2019","Geyer, Johannes/0000-0001-7851-4907",,,,,23,5,5,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Vulnerability to drought, arguably increasing on the back of climate change and population pressures, provides a compelling justification for encouraging economic diversification. It is less clear, however, which specific social or economic sectors can provide pro-poor economic transformation. In this paper we assess the potential for diversification into both sedentary agricultural and non-farm activities in Ethiopia.

Following some empirical researches (Boissin et al. in J Small Bus Entrep 22(2):101-122, 2009), we know some predictive factors for the emergence of an entrepreneurial project. But another question remains largely unexplored: What are the psychological mechanisms that may interplay in entrepreneurial intention and career choices? Our research aims to demonstrate that entrepreneurship is an objective which relies entirely on willingness, and, therefore, is much more dependent on interpersonal features than on economic and environmental constraints. In particular, we wish to highlight the personal dynamics in shaping, maturing, and implementing a choice of entrepreneurial career in order to extract volitional characteristics of this career choice. The hypotheses are tested using data from interviews conducted with French students in business schools, engineering schools, and universities. Our dynamic approach to study the psychosocial processes involved in the definition of an entrepreneurial career helps to understand the interest of young people in the entrepreneurial process. This research has demonstrated that volition has a key role in binding an individual commitment to an ambitious career objective.","[Ilouga, S.

However, for many communities, especially small communities, these attributes are uniform across roadway types and therefore unable to adequately explain observed variation in traffic volumes. The new method uses novel explanatory variables that are intrinsically derived through a modified form of centrality, a network analysis metric that quantifies the topological importance of a link in a network. The new approach requires minimal data collection and is easily executed using a geographic information system. The case study showed high quality results (out-of-sample validation R-2 = 0.95).

We adopt a multi-stage strategy in which, in the first stage, partial frontiers' approaches are considered to measure the performance of the different funds in the sample. In the second stage, the results yielded by the partial frontiers are plugged into different investment strategies based on a recursive estimation methodology whose persistence performance is evaluated in the third stage of the analysis. Results indicate that, for both types of funds, performance persistence actually exists, but only for the worst and, most notably, best funds. This result is robust not only across methods (and different choices of tuning parameters within each method) but also across both SRI and Islamic funds-although in the case of the latter persistence was stronger for the best funds. The persistence of SRI and Islamic funds represents an important result for investors and the market, since it provides information on both which funds to invest in and which funds to avoid.

Investors seem to be aware of this relation, as we further find the private information conveyed via the issuer-reputable underwriter match to have a significantly positive effect on at-issue yield spreads.

This study examines the effectiveness of financial reforms carried out in Taiwan recently and measures the adequacy of the deposit insurance fund (DIF), including financial restructuring fund and Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) strategy in Taiwan. We have improved on the methodology of Episcopoc (2004) and report estimates of the cost of deposit insurance and implied reserves for each bank or financial holding company. Estimates of the implicit cost of government guaranty of the DIF are also included. To stabilize its financial environment in 2000, the Taiwanese government amended many bank regulations, including the enactment of the Financial Holding Company Act (FHC Act) of 2001 and the Financial Restructuring Fund Statute. Our evidence shows lower volatilities and average unit cost of deposit insurance for seven sampled FHCs compared to sixteen sampled banks, even though the FHCs are larger. These results indicate the effectiveness of the financial reforms put forward by the Taiwanese government. When implied reserves are compared with the Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) strategy of 2%, imposed by the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) in 2007, we find that the DIF would have been sufficient in 2006, but not in 2000. The results imply that the fixed target ratio for the DIF may not be appropriate. In addition, the details of financial reforms in Taiwan starting in 2001 are provided and demonstrate resolve in implementing financial reforms. Finally, financial reforms of Taiwan and the calculations of DRR and estimates of the implicit cost of government guaranty of the DIF can be used as lessons for other countries.

Sweden was the only exception. This paper evaluates the net contribution of post-enlargement A10 immigrants to Swedish public finances in 2007. On average, A10 immigrants generate less public revenue than the population on average, but they also cost less. The net result is a zero or small positive net contribution. In particular, A10 immigrants do not benefit more from basic social welfare than the population on average. The discounted net contribution over the A10 immigrants' lifetimes may be positive or negative depending, for example, on their income assimilation rates and on future real interest rates.","Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Ruist, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",joakim.ruist@economics.gu.se,,,,,,,20,16,16,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We find that banks with long board tenure audit committees have lower total risk and idiosyncratic risk, and banks with busy directors on their audit committees have higher total risk and idiosyncratic risk. These suggest that high audit committee effectiveness may constrain bank risk-taking activities. We also find that firm performance is more positively associated with bank risk for banks with long board tenure, more female audit committee members, or large size audit committees than for other banks, consistent with the notion that audit committee effectiveness may increase risk management effectiveness. However, this finding should be interpreted cautiously as it is contrary to the results on audit committee busyness.(C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The simulation results suggest that returns from peer funds within the family significantly affect investors' updating on fund alphas since the posterior distribution on fund alphas experiences a faster shrinkage than those reported in the previous literature.

We use an extended version of the Solow growth model with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) a function of the key variables, viz. physical capital accumulation, human capital accumulation, trade openness and capital flows, fiscal policy and financial development. The key contribution of this study is to show that openness when interacted with the human capital stock disaggregated by gender, has differential impacts on economic growth. While the positive impact of male secondary schooling captures the direct skill effect relative to primary schooling, the marginal influence of female primary/secondary schooling fails to show a positive impact on growth at higher levels of openness.

This fourfold pattern was not addressed by either version of prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky Econometrica 47:363-391, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman Journal of Risk and Uncertainty 5:297-323, 1992). We show how prospect theory can accommodate the pattern by combining an overweighting of low probabilities with a decreasingly elastic value function. We then examine the performance of prospect theory with two decreasingly elastic value functions: Prospect theory performs better, both quantitatively and qualitatively, with a normalized logarithmic value function than with a normalized exponential value function. We discuss several issues, and speculate about why Tversky and Kahneman did not address Markowitz's fourfold pattern.","[Scholten, Marc] European Univ, P-1500210 Lisbon, Portugal; [Read, Daniel] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Scholten, M (通讯作者)，European Univ, Estr Correia 53, P-1500210 Lisbon, Portugal.",marc.scholten@europeia.pt; daniel.read@wbs.ac.uk,"Scholten, Marc/AAT-8926-2020","Read, Daniel/0000-0001-6672-9310; Scholten, Marc/0000-0003-1868-5928",ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,44,41,51,0,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Therefore, this article was started with the objective of bringing to light the socio-economic factors affecting the decision of smallholder farmers' households to keep small ruminants and non-ruminant livestock. We used the Malawi Third Integrated Household Survey data, commissioned by National Statistical Office, in which 5 711 households were randomly sampled and interviewed from March 2010 to March 2011. The article fits a simulated maximum likelihood multivariate probit to the data. With respect to the policy variables considered in the analysis, unlike higher education levels and older household heads, younger household heads are more likely to keep small ruminants and non-ruminant livestock. Extension contact and credit access did not promote the keeping of small ruminants and non-ruminant livestock. There is a strong location bias towards keeping small ruminants in the central region of Malawi while there is also a bias against keeping pigs in southern Malawi. Reshaping extension packages toward well rounded crop-livestock messages is an important factor to consider in promoting small ruminant and non-ruminant production in Malawi.","[Maonga, B.

Therefore, more widespread immigration could cause a deep change in industrialized countries' social protection systems. This article challenges this analysis. Using a multilevel analysis based on French individual data, it shows that, first, hostility towards immigrants is not statistically related to support for the welfare state. Second, specific types of hostile beliefs are associated with this support, but not ever negatively, since some anti-immigration beliefs increase support for social protection. Third, the forms of beliefs about immigrants associated to lower support for social protection are more widespread within the electorate close to the UMP, while beliefs favoring social protection are poorly exploited politically and tend to be developed by economically vulnerable people.","[Berton, Raul Magni] Univ Grenoble, PACTE, Sci Grenoble, Grenoble, France; [Berton, Raul Magni] Sci Grenoble, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Berton, Raul Magni] PACTE, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Berton, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble, PACTE, Sci Grenoble, Grenoble, France.",raul.magni-berton@iep-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,19,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

In this paper we discuss the hypothesis that GDP can still be a reliable estimate of growth. Nevertheless only if GDP is connected exports that are leading many countries out of the crisis, when public spending is collapsing and monetary policies do not solve the contemporary credit crunch. Exports are important, with particular attention to any component that is related to exports. International Tourism Receipts must be included. According to the World Bank database and thanks to a cluster analysis of International Tourism Receipts and GDP growth from 2007 to 2011, positive variations of GDPs are perfectly matching with positive variations of tourism receipts. The cluster analysis emphasizes differences among 'regions' or continents. Europe and USA are relatively worse than Emerging Economies and this performance can be related to an increase of trade in emerging economies more than in mature ones. (C) 2014 The Authors.

A review of the literature provided support for the use of assets owned by a household as an indicator of household resilience. Several methods of constructing household asset indices emerged from the literature reviewed. The application of four of these methods to Demographic and Health Survey data from six African countries is presented in this paper. The resulting indices were used to estimate individual socio-economic status scores for all households. All four methods performed similarly across the assessment characteristics, but yielded different results when the households were grouped into quintiles based on the estimated socio-economic status scores. As suggested by the literature, quintiles were used to classify the study households into categories of socio-economic status based on the estimated socio-economic status scores. However, socio-economic status was not evenly distributed across the study households making the use of a quintile approach inappropriate for grouping the households. Cluster analysis was applied as an alternative to the quintile classification to group the study households. Cluster analysis appeared to be a more effective approach to grouping households, both in that it does not assume an even distribution of socio-economic status across households - as the quintile approach does - and it provides a useful indication of changes in the per cent of households falling into different socio-economic status groups over time.","[Browne, M.; Ortmann, G.

However, recent statistical data about unemployment and growth in EU have revealed some weak spots of this traditional view. The human capital itself seems not to be a guarantee of economic stability and presumable quick recovery from crisis. On the contrary we see countries like Spain or Cyprus where the level of human capital, expressed as a percentage of tertiary educated population, is relatively very high but the unemployment reaches critical levels and economic growth is weak or negative. In this article we continue with our previous research and show that human capital must reflect the economic structure to foster the economic growth. Otherwise it might only cause higher level of unemployment due to crowding out effect and imbalances on the labor market. We also deal with responses of regional economies on recent economic crisis, when we show asymmetric responses based on structural differences and human capital endowment.

Traditionally, when a new product is launched, companies will Asses consumer innovativeness by creating specific customer profiles. These profiles take into account intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence consumer behaviour regarding radical brand extensions.

Because CO2 emissions generate social costs, through their effect on climate change, which escape the price mechanism, a tax on CO2 is indicated. An ideal tax would alter the consumer prices so that they match the marginal social costs. This setting thus calls for a specific tax on fuel equal to the value of externality resulting from the combustion of a unit of fuel. Since such tax scheme is readily available, we study to what extent the existing CO2 tax policies make use of it. We find that they do only to a limited extent. Thus our policy prescription is to drop existing CO2 taxes and use the existing fuel taxes to adjust fuel prices so that they match the marginal social costs related to burning of fuel.

The new concept is the unexamined logically and functionally to determine its relevance and practicability. In this context, a new structure of the economic cycle (from which the crisis phase is rejected) is proposed and examined.

Businesses, nonprofits, and nonfederal government agencies that received this type of stimulus funding were required to report the number of jobs directly created and saved as a result of their funding. Created and saved jobs represent, precisely, the full-time equivalent of jobs funded by first- and second-tier recipients of and contractors on ARRA grants, loans, and contracts. In this article, the author categorizes these jobs into either the private sector (businesses and nonprofits) or the government sector. It is estimated that at the one-year mark following the start of the stimulus, 166,000 of the 682,000 jobs directly created/saved were in the private sector. Examples of private sector stimulus jobs include social workers hired by nonprofit groups to assist families, mechanics to repair buses for public transportation, and construction workers to repave highways. Examples of government stimulus jobs include public school teachers, civil servants employed at state agencies, and police officers. While fewer than one of four stimulus jobs were in the private sector, more than seven of nine jobs in the U.S. economy overall reside in the private sector. Thus, stimulus-funded jobs were heavily tilted toward government.

The methodology requires the participants to report the current symptom severity for their family members suffering from chronic mental illness, using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Scale. They were then interviewed about how different aspects of family resilience applied to their own lived experiences as primary caregivers using Sixeby's Family Resilience Scale based on Walsh's conceptual framework of family resilience.

Our results show that operational risk was present in the lack of the documentation, background check, in the behavior of the mortgage lenders, unauthorized trades and in the worth of securitized loans when they were sold in volatile markets. Moreover, the operational risk had a great influence in the duration of the crisis.

The model include variable such as: real gross domestic product growth, gross domestic product deflator, 10-year bond yield spread and FED funds rate. The impact of gross domestic deflator, 10-year bond yield spread and FED funds rate over real gross domestic product growth is significant. We studied also net inflows portfolio equity in emergent economies by building a chart.","[Ionescu, Adrian Marius] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,ionescu.adrianmarius@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,165,171,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000022,0

To overcome the limitation of internal resources SMEs look for cooperative relationship with foreign partners, which in this context serves as a source of resources. In addition, the performance of small firms is strongly related to the human capital specifically the managerial competences. Based on the extant literature this study aims to investigate the role of managerial competences on the relationship quality which in turn affects the competitive advantage of small business in export markets. Data were collected among small and medium manufacturers that are currently involved in export activities. A total of 228 small and medium businesses participated in this study. This study uses structural equation modeling approach for data analysis. Findings of the study indicate that managerial competence is a function of relationship quality and competitive advantage. In addition relationship quality is significantly related to competitive advantage Finally, relationship quality partially mediates the relationship between relationship quality and competitive advantage.

The content of this relationship is first of all the legitimate right of the eligible person to be offered by the obliged person to buy a particular thing and the corresponding obligation of the owner to offer the thing if it shall be sold. The purpose of the pre-emption right is to secure a priority status of the eligible person as regards the potential acquisition of the subject of pre-emption right. The pre-emptive right may be established in particular through rules provided directly by the law. The law may establish pre-emption rights in various situations. Most often it is the right of co-owners by shares to buy the share or shares offered for sale by other co-owners. This right was dominating to the relationship of the co-owners by share until the entry into force of the Civil Code No. 89/2012 Coll. as part of a general regulation of co-ownership.

In Experiment 1, we rule out beliefs in mean reversion as a cause of the disposition effect. Although a belief in the mean reversion of stock prices should be independent of whether an investor owns or only follows the stock, we show only investors who own the stock behave as though prices will reverse. In Experiment 2, participants buy and sell securities over multiple periods. We find that self-regard and investing confidence (two types of self-esteem) have opposing influences on investors' tendency to hold losing investments. Investors with lower self-regard hold losing investments longer than those with higher self-regard, and investors with higher confidence hold losing investments longer than those with lower confidence. We focus on investors' tendency to hold losing stocks too long because prior research suggests the gain versus loss sides of the disposition effect are driven by different biases.","[Kadous, Kathryn] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Tayler, William B.] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Thayer, Jane M.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Young, Donald] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Emory University; Brigham Young University; University of Virginia; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Kadous, K (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, 1300 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",kkadous@emory.edu,"Kadous, Kathryn/B-4179-2008","Kadous, Kathryn/0000-0002-3284-238X; Young, Donald/0000-0001-8942-0308",,,,,85,22,25,3,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

A questionnaire survey and the eye tracking technique were adopted to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the decision making of consumers. The content of the questionnaire survey included product system, product exterior, and brand appearance. The results of the survey showed that 71% of the subjects were willing to spend more money to buy their favorite brand of smartphone. In addition, the analysis of the eye tracking data indicated some significant differences in the sequential position of viewing the phones' logos. The viewing of most subjects focused on the smartphone brand rather than on the product specifications and price. To sum up, this study suggests that the brand logo is the most important criterion when consumers make a decision to buy a product. The myth impression of the specific brand existed prior to the decision to buy the product. Therefore, we believe that the amount of sales of the product depends mostly on the brand.

However, financial inclusion in Indonesia currently is quite low compared to other developing countries. One of the strategies is to establish microfinance instituions (MFI). The MFI is believed to be an important tool to reach the low-income people. Access to financial services has allowed many low-income families to make a significant progress in their own efforts to escape from poverty. The government supports the growth of microfinance services through many instruments, such as regulations, subsidy, and directed credit policies. The government aware that such policies have not been effective in providing the poor with a sustainable access to the MFIs services. Assessing potential demand is one aspect to ensure that the microfinance is feasible and hence the sustainabilty of the services is assured. This study is aimed to analyze the potential demand for microfinance services in West Java by district areas. The approach used in this study is to employ the rich information about household and household members in the National SocioEconomic Survey (Susenas) data. Data from Bank of Indonesia on the size of depositor funds or credit disbursed in rural banks (BPR) are also used to supplement the previous data sources. The result shows that potential demand for microfinance services in West Java are almost 2 million people who are self-employed and self-employed with no paid workers. The potential demand for saving is estimated at Rp 1,902 billion, micro credit is estimated at Rp 16,669 billion, and the need for microfinance institution in terms of BPR is about 513 units, which is far above the existing number of BPR in West Java.

Data were collected from a panel of 493 consumers from 132 households participating in a one-week trial of an innovative premium consumer product. Using structural equation modeling, the results show that deal proneness has a stronger influence, albeit an unexpected positive one, on new product adoption than consumer innovativeness and brand loyalty. Moreover, multiple-group analyses between consumer age and sex groups revealed no significant differences in these influences.

In six regions, the hypothesis of perfect competition was not rejected. In the other nine, the conduct parameter estimates were very close to zero. These results contradict both the empirical literature and the reports produced by Parliamentary Inquiries in the early 2000s, which found suspicions of market power in dairies in several Brazilian states.

The comparative analysis is based on the important similarities between Romania and Poland, concerning rural areas and development priorities. In Poland, the most important issues were solved by reducing bureaucracy, increasing regions' autonomy, promoting organizations providing assistance and consulting services and state's active involvement in the support of private co-financing.

Regarding this, there is a well-known model, the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991), that enables accurate outcomes predicting the entrepreneurial intentions, and consequently the entrepreneurial behavior. The aim of this paper is to explain the entrepreneurial intentions using the Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior.

There are a number of cost-cutting initiatives, but to overcome these challenges, banks need to define a new approach to clients, choose the right team, define new products and services and properly engage the organization in the new period that will come after the crisis. To maintain existing customers and attract new ones, financial institutions need to keep their offers up to date with the latest features. These days, it's not good enough to simply offer online banking services or other innovative solutions, it more important to be useful for clients and for the bank also. Banking over the internet has attracted attention over the past years from bankers and other financial services industry participants and this is due to the rapid and significant growth in electronic commerce. The most recently studies emphasize the fact that more than 54 millions of Europeans used the on-line bank services and in the same time, the supplying of the services through the Internet brings huge benefits for the banks also. The reducing of the costs, the keeping of the clients or the attraction of the new clients, the growing of the operation speed of the transactions are only few of them.","[Tasca, Marius George] BRD Grp Soc Gen, Iasi, Romania",,,marius.tasca@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-020-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,179,184,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346751900024,0

Dissents were rare during the Committee's first 20 years but began to increase in the late 1950s. The number of dissents increased sharply during the late 1970s and early 1980s, when both inflation and unemployment were unusually high. However, at other times, the number of dissents was not correlated with either inflation or the unemployment rate. A review of FOMC records and published statements indicates that dissents often reflect fundamental disagreement about (i) how to achieve the Committee's macroeconomic objectives and (ii) the current stance of policy. The number of dissents also appears to have been influenced by the language used by the FOMC to communicate instructions to the manager of the System Open Market Account.

The general-to-specific modelling methodology developed by Hendry (1980) was employed to analyze short-run dynamic intervariable relationships, while Engle-Granger (1987) and Gregory-Hansen (1996) methodologies were used to analyze long-run relationships. In both methods, growth rate and ISE index are the variables that reduce banks' credit risk in the long run, while money supply, foreign exchange rate, unemployment rate, inflation rate, and interest rate are the variables that increase banks' credit risks.

The concept designed to encompass different facets of this financial education is labeled financial literacy. A large number of concepts are used within the umbrella of financial literacy, and quite different measurement instruments exist, more or less sound. This conceptual and operational heterogeneity makes things complicated and does not allow comparisons and concrete actions. In order to improve people's financial literacy we first need to define the concept and then find the best ways to measure one's degree of financial literacy. Through our study we synthesized the definitions and instruments previously used and we suggest a comprehensive approach for obtaining a measurement instrument for this latent variable financial literacy.

We extend existing research by modeling the impact of extant accounting rules on conservative accounting. Accounting rules typically require assets to be written down when their fair values drop sufficiently below their book values. We document evidence of the resulting non-discretionary conservatism and show that it appears to explain some of the results from previous research on contracting incentives. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Separate financing becomes more attractive than joint financing when the fraction of returns lost under default increases and when projects have lower mean returns, higher variability, more positive correlation, and more negative skewness.

Using descriptive statistics and regression models, this paper analyzes the trips, distances, mode choices, trip purposes, and time of day travel characteristics for older adults. It provides empirical evidence of basic travel behaviors and needs of older adults, examines heterogeneous characteristics between four different age groups, and focuses on sustainable mobilities, particularly the influence of transit-oriented developments. The data come from a 2009 travel-counts survey of the Denver, Colorado, (U.S.) metropolitan area, and include 4268 adults aged 60 and over, and 15,678 total trip activities. Consistent with existing research, total trips and mean distances decline with age, and mode of travel shifts away from car-driver. Each age group exhibits unique behaviors. For instance, the 75 to 84-year-old group is most mobile by car, and least by walking or transit. The models reveal that factors relating to changes in travel behaviors are quite complex, suggesting the need for research that examines lifestyle clusters more so than age and age groups.

The findings also reveal that price location is significantly negative when related to market responses of the overall execution period, and that such a relationship can last longer.

Workers with earnings at least equivalent to 16 hours at the minimum wage would be entitled to 100 percent of the MBM. We also investigate the impact of three alternative proposals: (a) a change in the above hours cut-off from 16 to 30 hours; (b) a guaranteed income equal to 100 percent of the MBM, irrespective of earnings; and (c) a $3/hour conditional wage subsidy. To do this, we first estimate a structural labour supply model using the existing tax code and predict the labour supply of a representative sample of individuals based upon the parameter estimates of the model. Simulations show that the original recommendation would have strong negative impacts on participation rates of low earners and that its cost would exceed $2 billion. Increasing the hours cut-off is predicted to have little impact beyond that of the original recommendation. Providing a guaranteed income equivalent to 100 percent of the MBM, on the other hand, would have a large impact. We find that contrary to what is usually assumed, guaranteed income schemes may increase the incidence of low income rather than decrease it.","[Clavet, Nicholas-James] Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Duclos, Jean-Yves; Lacroix, Guy] Univ Laval, IZA, CIRANO, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Clavet, NJ (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",,"Lacroix, Guy/H-9015-2017","Lacroix, Guy/0000-0001-6415-4496",,,,,27,12,12,0,21,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Many governments have used a variety of intervention policies to recover their financial systems. By examining the dynamic changes in bank performance before and after government intervention, this study demonstrates the use of the piecewise latent trajectory model. We used the data collected from Bloomberg for banks of five major Asian economies, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, over the eleven-quarter period from the 4th quarter of 2007 to the 2nd quarter of 2010 on six financial performance indicators reflecting solvency, credit risk and profitability. The change patterns of bank performance before/after government intervention during the global financial crisis have been compared among the five economies. Our empirical results indicate that, on average, the bank performance in terms of solvency, credit risk, and profitability improves after government intervention. Moreover, the influence of government intervention on bank performance depends on the evaluative financial indicator, the economy, and whether banks are internationalized. South Korea and Hong Kong have been identified to be the economies with stronger bank performance after government intervention. Policies demonstrated useful in South Korea and Hong Kong have been summarized and discussed. (C) 2012 Elseier B.V.

To determine how education quality is capitalized into housing prices, we deal with endogeneity bias by employing a natural experiment occasioned by China's education reforms. Based on monthly panel data for 52 residential areas in Shanghai, we conducted a natural experiment based on the exogenous designation of specific high-quality schools as Experimental Model Senior High Schools (EMSHS). Our natural experiment proved useful in analyzing how new information affected housing prices in China's developing housing market. We found evidence that housing prices included allowances for these new EMSHS designations.

By using a unique dataset that merges a representative sample of Italian households with administrative data on tax enforcement, we first find that tax morale is positively correlated with tax enforcement. Second, to deal with possible endogeneity of tax enforcement, we show that results are confirmed in an IV specification using the change in the tax gap at the provincial level as an instrument for tax enforcement. Finally, we provide evidence that the impact of tax enforcement and social environment is stronger at low quantiles of tax morale. Our results show that besides that of lowering the expected value of tax evasion, tax enforcement has an additional and indirect effect on tax compliance through its effect on tax morale.

We begin with a general equilibrium model of a small open economy in which migration is exogenous. Migrants must be equipped with capital, and the resulting demands for capital will generate cross-border flows of capital. Next, we move to an empirical exercise in which we allow both capital and labor flows to be endogenous. We test this model using data from a panel of OECD countries. We conclude that migration flows do in fact generate substantial matching capital flows. We calculate that increased migration may have accounted for as much as one-fifth of the increase in the US current account deficit since 1960.","[Gollin, Douglas] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England; [Lange, Fabian] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",University of Oxford; McGill University,"Lange, F (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Leacock Bldg,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",douglas.gollin@qeh.ox.ac.uk; fabolange@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,5,6,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

When employees perceive themselves as supported by the organization, they reciprocate with increased work motivation. However, we do not know how this knowledge can be developed into management initiatives that increase public employees perceived support, because severe endogeneity problems make it difficult to estimate the effect of organizational support on employee commitment outside the laboratory. We use a randomized field experiment involving more than 800 public employees to estimate the effect. We find no average effect of the organizational support treatment on the employees perceived organizational support. Yet, a subgroup analysis shows a positive treatment effect when the employees local front-line managers felt less supported prior to the intervention.

The results of such stress test exercises have recently been disclosed to the public in an attempt to restore confidence and to curb bank opaqueness by helping investors distinguish between sound and fragile institutions. In an unprecedented effort for transparency, the 2011 European Union stress test lead to the release of some 3400 data points for each of the 90 participating banks. This makes it an ideal setting to investigate a number of hypotheses on the information role of the stress tests. In this paper we examine the 2011 European stress test exercise to assess whether and how it affected bank stock prices. Our event study analysis shows that the test's results were considered relevant by investors. The market did not simply look at the detailed historical data which was released after the tests, but also attached considerable importance to variables measuring each bank's vulnerability to the simulated downturn scenario. The latter include proxies for liquidity risk and model risk. Information on sovereign debt holdings, while affecting market reaction on a univariate basis, is not statistically significant in a multivariate setting. We also find that the market is not able to anticipate the test results and this is consistent with the idea of greater bank opaqueness prior to the disclosure of the stress test results. Overall, our analysis shows that stress tests produce valuable information for market participants and can play a role in mitigating bank opacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It also aims to investigate if diversification strategy is affected by the likelihood of distress. The analysis is based on probit regressions employing panel data for the 2006-2010 period. Evidence reveals that operating profitability is negatively related with distress and has the highest impact on the likelihood of distress. Liquidity decrease is the second most important determinant of distress for cash- constrained firms, while high leverage is the second most important determinant of distress for the equity-constrained firms. Governance variables have weaker impact on distress. Group-affiliated firms have lower likelihood of distress. Globalization reduces distress in all models. Reducing investments and increasing diversification raises the likelihood of failure in equity constrained firms. Evidence documents that the likelihood of distress is the most important determinant of diversification. Financial distress acts as a disciplining device and induces higher relatedness in cash-constrained firms while it encourages diversification in equity-constrained firms. The paper contributes to existing literature by revealing that the type of distress affects the ranking and sign of the coefficients of its determinants, documents that corporate ownership and diversification affects the likelihood of distress, and distress is the main determinant of diversification strategy. Results indicate that corporations prevailing in countries with weak protection of investor rights and small financial markets,which increase vulnerability to shocks, should focus on pre-distress restructuring of diversification strategy and ownership structure in addition to financial policies.","Bogazici Univ, Isetme Bolumu, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Ugurlu, M (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Isetme Bolumu, Istanbul, Turkey.",maugurlu@gmail.com,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,116,0,1,1,43,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We use longitudinal data from three time periods to study temporal shifts in HE participation and attainment across parental income groups for children going to university in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The key finding is a highly policy relevant one, namely that HE expansion has not been equally distributed across people from richer and poorer backgrounds. Rather, it has disproportionately benefited children from relatively rich families. Despite the fact that many more children from higher income backgrounds participated in HE before the recent expansion of the system, the expansion acted to widen participation gaps between rich and poor children. This finding is robust to different measures of education participation and inequality. It also emerges from non-parametric estimations and from a more detailed econometric model allowing for the sequential nature of education choices with potentially different income associations at different stages of the education sequence.","[Blanden, Jo; Machin, Stephen] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Blanden, Jo; Machin, Stephen] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Blanden, J (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,,"Blanden, Jo/0000-0002-9355-703X",,,,,22,6,6,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We find that the cognitive bias is a statistical artifact because the anchoring test is biased itself. In particular, it produces misleading results if macroeconomic analysts use more comprehensive information than assumed by the test. Our results have important implications for a wide range of empirical research relying on survey data to capture market participants' expectations, for example, studies analyzing the impact of macroeconomic conditions on asset prices, equity risk premiums, or market liquidity.","[Hess, Dieter; Orbe, Sebastian] Univ Cologne, Corp Finance Seminar, Cologne, Germany; [Hess, Dieter] CFR Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Hess, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Corp Finance Seminar, Cologne, Germany.",,,,,,,,48,11,13,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Our results indicate strong support for the hypothesis that population growth caused by the increase in Hispanics, whether from international immigrants, migrants from within the United States, or from natural growth in families, has fueled increased economic growth in those small, rural communities whose populations had been in decline during the 1970s or the 1980s.

This paper studies the roles of country and industry effect on several major European financial markets. We find clear evidence that diversification over industries yields fundamental relevance for obtaining more efficient portfolios, and that ignoring the industrial mix leads to an important loss of diversification benefits. In addition we examine the behavior of country and industry effects during high (low) volatility periods. Alluring investors to diversify across industries requires a country to industry effect ratio to be substantially lower during high than low volatility periods. The fact that countries tend to move together during volatile periods posits that industry diversification may provide relatively more protection in crisis. For the entire time span we find that industries provide better protection in times of high volatility relative to countries. However, countries do perform better in absolute terms. Finally, we conclude that investors seeking global representation in their investment portfolios should continue to consider diversifying broadly across both countries and industries. Our findings have important implications for international portfolio diversification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Following Caudill et al. (1995), and Caudill and Ford (1993), we develop a generalized dynamic model that accounts for heteroskedasticity in the cost inefficiency component of the error term in the stochastic frontier (SF) model and adopt a single-step approach (e. g., Battese and Coelli, 1995; Wang and Schmidt, 2002) to circumvent the problems associated with the two-step estimation procedure used by prior studies. We show that the results based on the heteroskedastic stochastic frontier (HSF) model combined with the single-step estimation approach sharply contrast with that of the traditional 'two-step' approach. These are important findings because they point to the limitations of previous studies on cost efficiency that use a two-step estimation approach. Our findings suggest that asset size, loan quality, and bank equity-to-asset ratio have significant negative impact on cost efficiency of banks. Government-owned banks in Taiwan are more likely to be cost efficient than privately owned banks. Macroeconomic environmental factors such as money supply and foreign exchange reserve ratio are likely to influence the cost efficiency of banking industry in Taiwan. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

To quantify multidimensional well-being, information on the relative weights of the different dimensions is essential. There is, however, considerable disagreement in the literature on the most appropriate weighting scheme to use. Making use of a recent data set for Flanders, we calculate and compare various common weighting schemes, which are uniformly applied to all individuals. We find that a policymaker would identify different groups of individuals as being worst off depending on the scheme that is chosen. In order to compare and evaluate the weighting schemes, we simulate the support each scheme would get in a voting procedure. Weighting schemes that obtain higher support reflect better the priorities of the respondents and suffer less from the problem of paternalism that is inherent to any common weighting scheme.","[Decancq, Koen] Univ Antwerp, Herman Deleeck Ctr Social Policy, Antwerp, Belgium; [Decancq, Koen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Louvain, Belgium; [Decancq, Koen] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Van Ootegem, Luc; Verhofstadt, Elsy] Univ Coll Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Van Ootegem, Luc; Verhofstadt, Elsy] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Ootegem, Luc] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Higher Inst Labour Studies HIVA, Louvain, Belgium",University of Antwerp; KU Leuven; Universite Catholique Louvain; HOGENT University College of Applied Sciences & Arts; Ghent University; KU Leuven,"Decancq, K (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Herman Deleeck Ctr Social Policy, Antwerp, Belgium.",koen.decancq@ua.ac.be; luc.vanootegem@hogent.be; elsy.verhofstadt@hogent.be,"Decancq, Koen/AAD-4756-2022","Decancq, Koen/0000-0002-5822-845X",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,14,14,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Although scope insensitivity is a problem that may be present in any valuation method, most previous literature has focused on evaluating scope sensitivity within the context of contingent valuation applications. Nevertheless, it is necessary to understand the demand-revealing properties of experimental auctions since they are increasingly used to value products, such as quasi-public goods. In this paper, we test explicitly whether estimates coming from experimental auctions may pass a scope test. We conduct experimental auctions on products with a subset of attributes (part) and a comprehensive set of attributes (whole) related to animal welfare using two multi-product auction approaches: sequential and simultaneous. Results show that estimates pass the scope test when multi-product auctions are conducted simultaneously but not when they are conducted sequentially for all valued products. Implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Depending upon this aim, a research was conducted intended to 50 doctors, who run health service in X Hospital. The sample size was limited with only one health establishment for not breaking the homogeneous structure of organizational levels.

First, they entertain systematically biased beliefs about how public policies affect economic outcomes. Second, voters vote retrospectively: they punish the incumbent for poor and reward him for good macroeconomic performance. Thus, political parties face a trade-off: offering popular yet economically harmful policies increases the chance of being elected today, but decreases the chance of re-election. We provide the first rigorous game-theoretical analysis of the trade-off. The model addresses two questions: How can biased beliefs and retrospective voting be explained consistently? What policy outcomes emerge in party competition? To micro-found persistently biased beliefs we introduce the psychological concept of mental models. Deviating from earlier studies, we allow parties to choose strategic mixtures of populist (i.e., bad yet popular) and good (but less popular) platforms. We show that retrospective voting provides a self-correction mechanism, so that parties offer strategic mixtures of policies in equilibrium rather than purely populist or purely good policy platforms.

Corresponding extensions of some basic results in asset pricing theory are presented. First, we derive arbitrage-free pricing rules based on hedging arguments. Because ambiguous volatility implies market incompleteness, hedging arguments determine prices only up to intervals. In order to obtain sharper predictions, we apply the model of utility to a representative agent endowment economy and study equilibrium asset returns.

Usually, classical SVM adopt a CEV process for instantaneous variance where the CEV parameter gamma takes just few values: 0-the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, 1/2-the Heston (or square root) process, 1-GARCH, and 3/2-the 3/2 model. Some other models, e.g. with gamma = 2 were discovered in Henry-Labord,re (Analysis, geometry, and modeling in finance: advanced methods in option pricing. Chapman & Hall/CRC Financial Mathematics Series, London, 2009) by making connection between stochastic volatility and solvable diffusion processes in quantum mechanics. In particular, he used to build a bridge between solvable superpotentials (the Natanzon superpotentials, which allow reduction of a Schrodinger equation to a Gauss confluent hypergeometric equation) and existing SVM. Here we propose some new models with and demonstrate that using Lie's symmetries they could be priced in closed form in terms of hypergeometric functions. Thus obtained new models could be useful for pricing volatility derivatives (variance and volatility swaps, moment swaps).","NYU, Polytech Inst, Dept Finance & Risk Engn, Metro Tech Ctr 6, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Itkin, A (通讯作者)，NYU, Polytech Inst, Dept Finance & Risk Engn, Metro Tech Ctr 6, RH 517E, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",aitkin@poly.edu,,,,,,,30,13,16,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

This study aims to address such differences by a comparative approach and is, to our best knowledge, the first one capturing the subjective dimension of urban mobility by integrating satisfaction and perception-related indicators at a city-level. Drawing on the socio-technical concept of urban mobility cultures, which combines socio-economic and urban form characteristics, mode-specific infrastructure supply, as well as the travel behaviour and underlying attitudes of a city's inhabitants, we collected a set of 23 indicators from several sources, mainly from the early 2000s. These data have been applied to a sample of 44 German cities. As a result of a factor and cluster analysis we identified six groups of cities ranging from relatively mature and homogenous socio-technical settings, referred to as 'cycling cities' or 'transit metropolises', to rather less well-defined urban mobility cultures such as 'transit cities with multimodal potential', whose forthcoming development is not yet directed towards a specific future and, therefore, is open for political debate. The mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of urban mobility culture that has been shown for some city groups is another starting-point for changing urban mobility cultures in terms of taking people's perceptions and evaluations of the local transport system more seriously.

This paper presents an analysis of the recent increase in the number of public bikesharing systems. Bikesharing is the shared use of a bicycle fleet, which is accessible to the public and serves as a form of public transportation. The initial system designs were pioneered in Europe and, after a series of technological innovations, appear to have matured into a system experiencing widespread adoption. There are also signs that the policy of public bikesharing systems is transferable and is being adopted in other contexts outside Europe. In public policy, the technologies that are transferred can be policies, technologies, ideals or systems. This paper seeks to describe the nature of these systems, how they have spread in time and space, how they have matured in different contexts, and why they have been adopted. Researchers provide an analysis from Europe and North America. The analysis draws on published data sources, a survey of 19 systems, and interviews with 12 decision-makers in Europe and 14 decision-makers in North America. The data are examined through the lens of diffusion theory, which allows for comparison of the adoption process in different contexts. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative analyses is used to explore the reasons for adoption decisions in different cities. The paper concludes that Europe is still in a major adoption process with new systems emerging and growth in some existing systems, although some geographic areas have adopted alternative solutions. Private sector operators have also been important entrepreneurs in a European context, which has accelerated the uptake of these systems. In North America, the adoption process is at an earlier stage and is gaining momentum, but signs also suggest the growing importance of entrepreneurs in North America with respect to technology and business models. There is evidence to suggest that the policy adoption processes have been inspired by successful systems in Paris, Lyon, Montreal, and Washington, DC, for instance, and that diffusion theory could be useful in understanding public bikesharing policy adoption in a global context.

They account for 60% of the total credit supplied by retail banks.

Cross-state regressions of the estimated responses on an index of mortgage market development suggest that spending in states with greater opportunities for home equity borrowing is more sensitive to housing demand shocks than in states with fewer opportunities, which is consistent with the prominence of a collateral channel over a wealth channel in explaining the link between housing and the overall economy.","[Abdallah, Chadi S.] Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Lastrapes, William D.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Abdallah, CS (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",abdallcs@muohio.edu; last@uga.edu,"Lastrapes, William D./AAC-6950-2019; Lastrapes, William D./ABA-2030-2020",,,,,,46,12,13,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Little attention has been paid to how airports were affected by the changes in the new institutional environment. In this study, we model the total factor productivity (TFP) for a panel of the largest airports in the UK over the 2002-2005 period and investigate whether the presence of LCCs had some impact on airports' TFP. Empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis that conspicuous entry of LCCs on European markets has impacted positively on the vertical chain by facilitating airports' productivity improvements. This result is robust to reverse causality issues associated with the possibility that the most efficient airports are those that are more likely to attract LCCs. Different possible arguments may explain our results: traffic increases brought about by LCCs for a given installed capacity might have generated higher TFP; more efficient organizational models might have been adopted to meet LCCs operational requirements (short turnaround times); cost reductions might have been realized to lower charges and attract LCCs; and competition from a larger number of airports induced by LCCs' wider catchment areas (with respect to full service airlines) might have exerted further pressure toward TFP improvements.","[Bottasso, Anna; Conti, Maurizio] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, I-16124 Genoa, Italy; [Piga, Claudio] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Genoa; Loughborough University,"Bottasso, A (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Via Vivaldi 5, I-16124 Genoa, Italy.",bottasso@economia.unige.it; mconti@economia.unige.it; claudio.piga@gmail.com,"BOTTASSO, Anna/AAD-6205-2021; Conti, Maurizio/AAC-9592-2021","Conti, Maurizio/0000-0001-8215-4836; BOTTASSO, Anna/0000-0002-9575-2840; Piga, Claudio/0000-0003-4828-9168",,,,,30,18,19,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In this paper, we use firm- and individual-level data to shed new light on these aggregate patterns and we examine changes in firm investment in physical capital and profitability. We provide evidence that labour productivity, investment and firm profitability all fell, on average, within firms over the course of the recession and that many of these adjustments were more pronounced in small firms. We also provide indicative evidence on the extent to which different firms might have engaged in labour hoarding'.

No previous studies have examined the development of trust while controlling for age differences in altruism. We hypothesized that older children are more likely to trust, and that this age-related increase is not due to an increase in altruism. In two experiments, we compared the choices of kindergarten (4-5 years) and elementary school (9-10 years) children in economic games. Age was positively related to both trust and altruism, but more strongly to the former. The age difference in trust was robust when we controlled for partner age and the ability to delay gratification. We further hypothesized that older children are more attuned to the probability of reciprocity. Indeed, older children were more sensitive to changes in the game's structure and the trustee's characteristics, suggesting that they are not only more trusting, but more discerning in their decisions of when to trust.

By focussing on self-reported innovation the study achieves a wider coverage of the effects of SME innovation policy than possible with more traditional indicators. Propensity score matching indicates that SMEs receiving UK state support for innovation were more likely to innovate than unsupported comparable enterprises. Innovating enterprises are shown to have grown significantly faster over the years 2002-2004 when other growth influences are appropriately controlled. Combining these two results and comparing the outlays on SME innovation policy with the estimated effects suggests that policy was efficient as well as effective. There is evidence that SME tax credits were expensive compared with earlier support instruments. But the overall high returns estimated suggest that, even in times of public spending cuts, persisting with SME innovation policy would be prudent.","Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Foreman-Peck, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",Foreman-peckj@cf.ac.uk,,"foreman-peck, james/0000-0001-9826-5725",,,,,56,73,80,13,171,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Despite its popularity, however, the real impact of P&R has been criticized by many who suggest that P&R can have little or even negative effects on car use reduction. This is mainly due to the so-called unintended effects, the most familiar being the abstraction from public transport; i.e., some P&R users had been making the whole trip by public transport prior the introduction of the P&R facility. This paper uses the findings of a users survey (N = 738) conducted in nine rail-based P&Rs located around the cities of Rotterdam and The Hague (The Netherlands) in order to get an overview of the impacts in terms of the vehicle km travelled (VKT) and the vehicle emissions (CO2, NOx, PM10 and SO2) of this popular transport infrastructure. In comparison with the existing literature, a number of additional unintended effects have been found, namely 'abstraction from bike' and 'Park and walk users' of P&R facilities, which reinforce the ambiguity surrounding the impact of P&R. Additionally, large differences have been found between the net impact of P&Rs according to their function: remote P&Rs perform better than peripheral P&Rs. This study suggests that the introduction of a fee for parking would reduce the unintended effects. Finally, it presents a number of policy suggestions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For a certain class of preferences social welfare does not depend on the degree of transparency and the policy that keeps the wedge between the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal product of labor constant across the states is shown to be optimal.

This paper puts several valuation approaches through a crucial test: How did these models perform in one of the worst periods of economic history, September 2008, when Lehman Brothers went under? Did they produce reasonable hedging strategies? We study several bottom-up and top-down credit portfolio models and compute the resulting delta hedging strategies using either index contracts or a portfolio of single-name CDS contracts as hedging instruments. We compute the profit-and-loss profiles and assess the performances of these hedging strategies. Among all 10 pricing models that we consider the Student-t copula model performs best. The dynamical generalized-Poisson loss model is the best top-down model, but this model class has in general problems to hedge equity tranches. Our major finding is however that single-name and index CDS contracts are not appropriate instruments to hedge CDO tranches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using security-level data on Treasury prices and quantities during the course of this program, we document a 'local supply' effect in the yield curve yields within a particular maturity sector responded more to changes in the amounts outstanding in that sector than to similar changes in other sectors. We find that this phenomenon was responsible for a persistent downward shift in yields averaging about 30 basis points over the course of the program (the stock effect). In addition, except at very long maturities, purchase operations caused an average decline in yields in the sector purchased of 3.5 basis points on the days when those operations occurred (the flow effect). The sensitivity of our results to security characteristics generally supports a view of segmentation or imperfect substitution within the Treasury market during this time.

We find support for these theoretical predictions on a sample of 531 Italian new technology-based firms, using several panel estimators to control for endogeneity of IVC and CVC.","[Bertoni, Fabio; Colombo, Massimo G.; Grilli, Luca] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Bertoni, F (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",fabio.bertoni@polimi.it,"Bertoni, Fabio/E-2087-2013; Grilli, Luca/K-6348-2017","Bertoni, Fabio/0000-0003-1478-673X; Colombo, Massimo G./0000-0003-0373-1565; Grilli, Luca/0000-0003-4550-9276",,,,,84,56,64,8,154,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using a sample of facilities of S&P 500 firms which report to the Toxic Releases Inventory from 1991 to 2001, this study employs dynamic panel data models to examine the effectiveness of state legislations and policies in increasing P2 and reducing toxic releases. I find that toxic waste legislations are effective in reducing toxic releases and in promoting P2, but the effect of policy instruments differ. Facilities in states with reporting requirement and mandatory planning adopt more P2 even in states that do not emphasize toxic waste reduction. The effectiveness of reporting is stronger among facilities with good environmental performance, while the potency of mandatory planning is greater among facilities with past P2 experience. In contrast, numerical goals reduce toxic pollution levels only among those which have been subjected to high levels of enforcement action. These suggest that reporting requirement and mandatory planning may be promoting the P2 practices which can improve public image and which benefit from enhanced technical know-how, but they are not causing meaningful pollution reductions, implying that the existing policies must be complemented by other approaches to achieve higher reductions in toxic pollution levels.

The model captures the well-known positive relationship between probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD; i.e., the inverse of recovery) and their counter-cyclical movement with the business cycle. In the absence of proper micro data on LGD, we use a random-sampling method to estimate the annual average LGD. We specify a two equation model for PD and LGD which is estimated with Finnish time-series data from 1989 to 2008. We also use a system of time-series models for the exogenous macro variables to derive the main macroeconomic shocks which are then used in stress testing aggregate loan losses. We show that the endogenous LGD makes a considerable difference in stress tests compared to a constant LGD assumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about whether entrepreneurial processes differ within social contexts. In this paper, we ask to what extent the antecedents and outcomes that make social entrepreneurship unique influence entrepreneurial processes. Using an inputs-throughputs-outputs framework, we assess the relationship between four antecedents (social mission/motivation, opportunity identification, access to resources/funding, and multiple stakeholders) and three outcomes (social value creation, sustainable solutions, and satisfying multiple stakeholders) to the dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation (innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, competitive aggressiveness, and autonomy) (Lumpkin and Dess, Acad Manag Rev 21(1):135-172, 1996). Our analysis suggests that many entrepreneurial processes remain essentially the same or are affected only slightly. However, autonomy, competitive aggressiveness, and risk-taking are influenced to some extent by the presence of multiple stakeholders and access to resources/funding. Entrepreneurial processes may also differ when applied to efforts to satisfy multiple stakeholders and achieve sustainable solutions. We subsequently discuss the implications of our analysis for future social entrepreneurship research and practice.","[Lumpkin, G.

Penn World Table Revisions and their impact on growth estimates,JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; INDEXES; GDP,"This paper sheds light on two problems in the Penn World Table (PWT) GDP estimates. First, we. show that these estimates vary substantially across different versions of the PWT despite being derived from very similar underlying data and using almost identical methodologies: that the methodology deployed to estimate growth rates leads to systematic variability, which is greater: at higher data frequencies, for smaller countries, and the farther the estimate from the benchmark year. Moreover, this variability matters for the cross-country growth literature. While growth studies that use low frequency data remain robust to data revisions, studies that use annual data are less robust. Second, the PWT methodology leads to GDP estimates that are not valued at purchasing power parity (PPP) prices. This is surprising because the raison d'etre of the PWT is to adjust national estimates of GDP by valuing output at common international (purchasing power parity [PPP]) prices so that the resulting PPP-adjusted estimates of GDP are comparable across countries. We propose an approach to address these two problems of variability and valuation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we explore risk premia in the covered bond market and particularly investigate whether and how credit risk is priced. In extant literature, yield spreads between high-quality covered bonds and government bonds are often interpreted as pure liquidity premia. In contrast, we show that although liquidity is important, it is not the exclusive risk factor. Using a hand-collected data set of cover pool information, we find that the credit quality of the cover assets is an important determinant of covered bond yield spreads. This effect is particularly strong in times of financial turmoil and has a significant influence on the issuer's refinancing cost. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is evident the predominance of the student's t copula in returns relationships. Association in tails is generally larger than the absolute. There is a fast decrease in association along time, but even after 5 days, there is still dependence between returns. For volatilities, Joe copula predominates in estimated bivariate relationships fit. Clayton copula rotated 180 degrees (survival), Gumbel, BB6 and BB8 copulas also fit some relationships. The magnitude of lagged associations is larger for risks than returns. Persistence in the dependences is very high, and decreases very little after the first lag. The tail dependence has larger values than the absolute in most relationships. We present a practical application of the proposed approach, based on optimal investment allocation and risk prediction.

This study combines data from a survey and a choice experiment in Tanzania to compare women's preferences with real choices of delivery care. We find that less empowered women and women who delivered their latest pregnancy outside a health facility find the technical quality of care less important, which indicates that their lower use of delivery care is partly induced by their preferences.

We first show that Delaware-incorporated firms with staggered boards and no outside blockholders increased CEO compensation following the mid-1990s Delaware legal cases that strengthened their ability to resist hostile takeovers. Consistent with the Gabaix and Landier (2008) contagion hypothesis, non-Delaware firms subsequently increased CEO compensation when the rulings affected a substantial number of firms in their industries. We further show how these legal developments contributed significantly to the rapid increase in CEO compensation in the late 1990s. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the analysis supports the view that not all oil price movements are alike and, and joint rises in oil and stock market can in fact be observed.

Providing participants with a social history - presenting the main results of an identical previous experiment conducted with different subjects - decreases the initial reluctance towards the punishment institution significantly. With social history, cooperative groups reach the social optimum more rapidly and there is lower efficiency loss due to reduced punishment.

We provide empirical evidence that mortgage officers greatly increase their output toward the end of each month, when the minimum monthly quota is assessed.

The general objective of the study was to determine the extent to which strategic human resource management has contributed to the performance of multinational firms in Nigeria. In order to achieve this, four other specific objectives were raised. Data for this research were obtained from both primary and secondary sources. Relevant published and unpublished literatures provide the secondary data. The primary data were obtained through questionnaire. Three hundred (300) questionnaires were administered to the employee of the two multinational firms and two hundred and sixty-two (262) were returned with a response rate of 87.33% and also collated for analysis. To achieve the objectives of this Study, four hypotheses were formulated. For the data analysis, the statistical test tools used included Descriptive Analysis, Analysis of Variance, Correlation and Regression Analysis with the aid of SPSS 15.0 computer packages. The results showed that selective hiring has significant effect on cost reduction of multinational firms. The Study also revealed that extensive training in organizations has significant relationship with market share of organizations. It was also observed that employment security assists multinational companies to build customers relationship. Based on these findings, some recommendations were made.Organizations should see selective hiring as a way of advancing the course of the corporation and should also outsource recruitment processes to professional so as to help them to continue being in businesses. Multinational Firms should learn more innovative ways of pleasing and satisfying the needs of their employees to increase sales turnover of their business.","[Akinyele, Samuel Taiwo; Worlu, Rowland; Kumolu-Johnson] Covenant Univ, Dept Business Management, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,Samuel.akinyele@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; Rowland.worlu@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; kumolujohnson@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1779,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500176,0

For cluster to be effective and to achieve such goals as: reducing production and transaction costs, effective collaboration of resources, increasing innovation activity, development of new technologies, etc., it is proposed to apply the method of virtual enterprises in order to form innovative industrial cluster. In Europe the concept of virtual cluster has been used for a long time, being the subject of many studies, and currently there is widespread transition from physical connections in a cluster to virtual communications that helps to create competitive advantage in a rapidly changing innovation economy. In Russian Federation the concept of a virtual cluster practically does not exist, because there is lack of legislation in this area, lack of necessary infrastructure in the economy and low efficiency of different institutions. However, usage of this form of clusters seems to be effective and promising. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Among the unfavourable outcomes are few representatives to act as representatives of Bumiputra taxpayers in relation to tax policy making. Additionally, there might be an increase in the number of taxpayers in the future due to an improved in the Malaysian economy. Coupled with mixed level of taxpayers' knowledge, more tax agents are needed in promoting tax compliance among the public. This is an opportunity that Bumiputra graduates should seize. Therefore, a professional entreprenurship program is proposed to overcome this issue. The proposed program is enforced in three stages. First, entreprenurship is instilled among the undergraduates in order to encourage them to be tax agents after the completion of their studies. Secondly, the current syllabus of Degree in Accountancy is also proposed to be altered slightly.

The main objective of this paper is to determine how bank failure in Nigeria can be predicted far ahead of its occurrence using a survival analysis approach. The paper attempts to identify the financial distress symptoms that can lead to a bank failure by employing the Cox Proportional Hazards Model using financial covariates from financial statements of banks. Panel data covering a period from 2003 to 2011 were analysed. The study shows that survival of banks in Nigeria is mostly influenced by 12 predictor variables that bank regulators could watch out for, to forestall bank distress. The study shows that banks that are high on non-performing loan to total loan plus lease are 43 times more likely to fail than banks that are not. Also, banks with high operating expense to average total assets are 9 times more likely to fail than banks that are not. Another interesting finding is that average survival time for commercial banks in Nigeria is 45 years; while that of merchant banks is 20 years implying that survival time of banks varies significantly according to their specialty in Nigeria. The study therefore recommends that the reform activities of the government should be well thought out and strategies for implementation should be put in place to enhance positive effect on the banking sector in Nigeria.","[Babajide, Abiola A.; Olokoyo, Felicia O.; Adegboye, Folasade B.] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,abiola.babajide@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; felicia.olokoyo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; folasadeadegboye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Babajide, Abiola Ayopo/M-8059-2013; Olokoyo, Felicia O./M-8193-2013","Olokoyo, Felicia/0000-0003-0176-0194",,,,,29,1,1,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2180,2199,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500214,0

The concept of Signaling is known since its introduction by the Nobelist Michael Spence in 1973. However, its applications were usually drawn from the viewpoint of prospective employees. Our point of view in this paper is to look at the problem from the employers' side. From that perspective, demand for labour force is inevitably blurred by the randomness of workers' productivity. The employer doesn't know if newly hired employee really possesses the productivity he or she had signalled by an educational level. Only after couple of working interactions genuine productivity is revealed. This leads to a game-like situation, because all agents of the labour market can repeatedly change their behaviour on the market, employees the preferred level of education and employers the wage scheme that is offered to employees accordingly to their education level. In the paper, I focus on the optimization problem of employers and I employ the dynamic approach. One of the most important variables in this decision is reliability of the signal, therefore my model explains how the results differ if the signal reliability changes.","[Bican, Vitezslav] Univ Econ Prague, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,v.bican@email.cz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,132,140,,,,,,9,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100014,0

As expected, higher payment rates increase farmers' willingness to sign a conservation contract whereas stricter management prescriptions reduce participation. Besides contract design variables, a number of farm-specific variables affect farmers' willingness to participate. Farmers, for instance, with previous experience in agri-environmental contracting are more likely to choose a contract than those without such experience. Our estimates of marginal willingness-to-accept show that farmers regard contractual obligations relating to fertilizer use and mowing dates as particularly demanding, resulting in high compensation requirements of (sic)100 -200 per hectare. Farms with high land use intensities - e.g. high stocking rates or low shares of permanent pasture - request higher compensation payments than less intensive farms.","[Breustedt, Gunnar; Schulz, Norbert; Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Kiel; University of Western Australia,"Breustedt, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",gbreustedt@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,,"Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe/0000-0002-9936-2460",,,,,25,20,20,0,41,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The existing empirical evidence is quite mixed with slightly more papers supporting that they do. We show that such lack of consensus is mainly due to current literature limitations regarding the measurement of real exchange rates (RERs), the identification of exchange rate regimes (ERRs), and the control for the incidence of real and nominal shocks. To address these limitations, we construct a novel monthly dataset for 63 countries over the period 19462007, which includes market-determined multilateral RER and a proxy for terms of trade. We find that ERRs indeed affect short-term real exchange rate volatility differently. While the evidence is generally consistent with Mussa's sticky prices argument, we find that for nonadvanced countries in post-Bretton Woods there exists a U-shape nominal flexibility puzzle of RER. We also find evidence of a short-run RER volatility puzzle. Having controlled for the incidence of real and nominal shocks, nonadvanced countries' RER volatility remains between 25% and 150% greater than that of the advanced economies. Moreover, the key literature finding that short-term RER volatility is higher in Bretton Woods (BW) than in post-Bretton Woods (PBW) for industrialized countries vanishes when using market-determined multilateral RER instead of official bilateral RER.

Our main conclusion is that OPEC's pricing power varies over time. In many instances, OPEC can lose power to limit oil price movements in either direction. Such changes in pricing power are induced by market conditions and can occur in both weak and tight market conditions. Because of OPEC's varying conduct, there is not a single model that fits OPEC behavior. Hence analysts have been forced to choose from a wide range of models to explain certain episodes. The empirical literature has not been successful in distinguishing between the various competing models, as these models offer very similar predictions.","[Fattouh, Bassam; Mahadeva, Lavan] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford OX2 6FA, England; [Fattouh, Bassam] Univ London, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of Oxford; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Fattouh, B (通讯作者)，Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford OX2 6FA, England.",bassam.fattouh@oxfordenergy.org; lavan.mahadeva@oxfordenergy.org,,,,,,,78,27,29,1,19,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Considering the customers' point of view, we argue that customers may hold different proneness to establish a relationship with the provider depending on the specific service context. Different relationship proneness will, in turn, influence the more or less favorable behavior of the consumer in the relationship. As such, this paper aims to increase understanding of consumer relationship proneness and its role in different service settings. Methodology: Data were collected in two contexts, high and low contact services (health services and wholesales, respectively). Through a convenience sample of 516 consumers, we conducted a survey to examine differences in consumer proneness and behaviors in both contexts. Conclusion: Results revealed that consumer relationship proneness and behaviors vary significantly among the contexts studied. In the high contact service (healthcare services), customers exhibit higher relationship proneness and show more favorable behaviors towards the relationship, when compared with the low contact service (wholesales). It was also found that the majority of consumer behaviors are, in both contexts, correlated with relationship proneness. Implications: This research aims to fill an existing gap in the RM literature by taking consumer relationship proneness into consideration. Additionally, the effect of service types has not yet been fully explored, particularly in the customer relationship field. In managerial terms, the results of this study provide guidance to managers to differentiate customer relationship strategies according to the specific service context that they operate in.","[Fernandes, Teresa; Esteves, Fabia] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,,tfernandes@fep.up.pt; fabiamarina@gmail.com,"Fernandes, Teresa/ABA-6569-2021","Fernandes, Teresa/0000-0001-5753-2188; Pires Esteves, Fabia/0000-0003-2610-0838",,,,,52,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,448,459,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500042,0

The analysis is conducted for the case of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, where state-owned land constitutes a significant share of the agricultural land market. The utilised data consists of public auction data provided by the Landgesellschaft Sachsen-Anhalt (i.e. the rural development agency in Saxony-Anhalt), and covers approximately 700 calls for bids from 2003 to 2010, supplemented with regional and structural data. Spatial correlation of land prices is considered by applying a spatial econometrics approach. Our analysis shows that apart from land characteristics, the number of bidders and the share of non-agricultural investors have an impact on the land price.","[Huettel, Silke; Odening, Martin] Humboldt Univ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Kataria, Karin; Balmann, Alfons] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Hüttel, S (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Invalidenstr 42, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",silke.huettel@agrar.hu-berlin.de,"Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020; Balmann, Alfons/E-6870-2011; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Hüttel, Silke/CAF-9025-2022; Buchenrieder, Gertrud/S-1035-2016","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Odening, Martin/0000-0001-6427-1641; Huttel, Silke/0000-0002-2141-2931; Buchenrieder, Gertrud/0000-0003-2995-867X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through Research Unit 986 Structural Change in Agriculture,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through Research Unit 986 Structural Change in Agriculture(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through Research Unit 986 Structural Change in Agriculture.

It was found that more infrastructural compatibility factors were rated as important in Industrial setting compared to Residential setting. The reasons for walking or not walking were also apparently different between the land use types. Lastly, a multinomial logit choice model was used to predict the propensity of walking and using other modes of transport. First/last mile trip distance, number of parked bicycles at transit stations, percentage of land for commercial use, and distance between origin/destination and nearest bus stop with services serving the transit station were found to be influential variables on the propensity of walking.

It includes realistic features such as tax deductibility of contributions and taxation of withdrawals, tax bracket structure with deductions, taxation of Social Security benefits, and tax risk at retirement. With current taxes, choosing a traditional account over a Roth creates small welfare losses in only a few cases, largely for those with higher incomes and pensions who are subject to the taxation of Social Security benefits. We also investigate tax variability and find that diversified strategies offer only small risk reduction benefits in our illustrations.","San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Lachance, ME (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",Marie.Lachance@sdsu.edu,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The primary aim of this paper is thus to examine the influence of both, productive (investment) and unproductive (consumption) government expenditure on growth in the OECD in 2000-2010. The dynamic panel data analysis is performed using the GMM. The results show that, unlike the theoretical assumptions, the influence of both types of spending on economic growth is positive. If the unproductive part of the spending includes especially the social transfers, those raise the disposable income of households, the consumption and thus also the GDP per capita. In case of productive spending, the effect of its volatility on growth was proved to be negative. It can be concluded that instead of budget cuts, fiscal policy authorities should primarily try to avoid the changes and volatility of the investment spending.","[Machova, Zuzana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,zuzana.machova@vsb.cz,"Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021","Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600",,,,,37,8,8,0,3,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Previous research on public goods experiments suggests that individual-level demographic and psychological variables correlate with player types. However, the key question about biological sources of variation in these preferences remains open. The aim of this study is to uncover genetic variations that influence differences in cooperative behavior. For this reason, we identify types of players within a strategic public goods experiment. We explicitly test for an association between individual variance in strategy choice and the functional promoter-region repeat of the Monoamine Oxidase A gene (MAOA). Our experimental findings suggest a link between MAOA and the occurrence of free-riding in females. Females with MAOA-L are less likely to behave like weak free-riders than MAOA-H carriers, whereas among males, our results did not support a significant relation between genotype and player type. Furthermore, MAOA-L female carriers contribute more than MAOA-H subjects to the public good if they know that others contribute nothing, and they showed slightly lower scores on the Machiavellianism scale. This is the first piece of evidence that genotype might predict player type within a public goods setting. It contributes to our understanding of biological drivers of economic decision making and points to the need for further exploration.","[Mertins, Vanessa] Univ Trier, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Union, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Schote, Andrea B.; Meyer, Jobst] Univ Trier, Dept Neurobehav Genet, Inst Psychobiol, D-54296 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier; Universitat Trier,"Mertins, V (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Union IAAEU, Behringstr 21, D-54296 Trier, Germany.",mertins@iaaeu.de,,"Mertins, Vanessa/0000-0002-2843-7381",,,,,89,3,4,2,12,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

Credit scoring models are used in practice in the majority of decisions related to the granting of credits, and are thus inherently part of the majority of processes (approval, enforcement, commercial, etc.) in the financial sector. Besides Gini coefficient or K-S statistic, J-divergence (also called Information value) is widely used to assess discriminatory power of credit scoring models. However, empirical estimator using deciles of scores, which is the common way how to compute the J-divergence, may lead to strongly biased results. The main aim of this paper is to describe properties of alternative, both parametric and non-parametric, estimators of J-divergence for credit scoring models with Beta distributed scores. As we show, the parametric and ESIS estimators are much more appropriate to use considering both the bias and mean squared error. Indeed, better estimator leads to better assessment of models, what may lead to better credit scoring models used in practice.","[Rezac, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math & Stat, Brno 61137, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,mrezac@math.muni.cz,"Rezac, Martin/JUV-6592-2023; Rezac, Martin/I-4034-2013",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1182,1191,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100118,0

Despite the remarkable growth figures the economic word frequency shares feature in the English, French, and German language corpora, the results suggest rejecting the economization hypothesis. In fact, the growth trends of economic word frequencies are stopped in all of the three language areas, in none of which the economy ever reached a dominant position throughout the entire 200 years. The results give reason to assume that the idea of an economized society is an intellectual artifact rather than a fact. This fact is emphasized not to prove the marginal relevance of research in economic risks and benefits, but rather in terms of a suggestion to consider re-focusing research foci and drawing increased attention to function systems beyond the politico-economic double stars of social science.

The reason is that a given climate risk borne by fewer people implies greater welfare losses. However, these losses turn out to be significant only if society is both risk and inequality averse and if climate damages are highly heterogeneous. We discuss how insurance and self-insurance of climate risk could theoretically mitigate this joint effect of uncertainty and heterogeneity and thus admit weaker climate policy. Insurance provides more efficient risk sharing and self-insurance allows strongly impacted individuals to compensate damages by increasing savings. We first use a simple analytical model to introduce the different concepts and then provide more realistic results from the integrated assessment model DICE.","[Schmidt, Matthias G.

After several agreements were signed a common labour market is to arise and develop. Since then a fear of mass labour migration from Kazakhstan to Russia is observed.

Our results suggest that free and fair elections have a significant direct effect on budgetary disclosure, and that they dampen the adverse effect on fiscal transparency of dependence on natural resource revenues.

In pursuit of this objective, 100 politicians were surveyed from four (4) political parties in Nigeria. Eighty five (85) of the 100 respondents responded. After editing, 81 responses formed the data which were analysed with simple descriptive statistics (such as tables, frequencies, percentages) and inferential statistics like Pearson's Correlation coefficient (r) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The finding indicates a low positive relationship between marketing concept and democratic governance. Again, politicians make promises to the electorates but fail to fulfil most of those promises when they get to power. This means that political marketers see marketing concept as a means to an end i.e. to capture the mandate of the electorate. Based on this finding, it is here recommended, among other things, that electorate should be more interested in the profile, antecedents and reputation of the politicians, rather than their promises.","[Worlu, Rowland E.

It is important that these needs were adapted by an accounting system, which should render the economic consequences of environmental and social aspects of the business. The theoretical framework of this paper is based on a comparison of theses various authors in the accounting for sustainable business development. The paper will mainly present the results of research on financial reporting of environmental and social aspects of the business environment in the Czech Republic. Based on research consists of a questionnaire survey carried out on a sample of 100 enterprises of different sizes Pilsen, Karlovy Vary and South Region. A questionnaire survey were investigated methods reporting environmental and social aspects of business and ways of monitoring environmental benefits and costs in the accounting system of enterprises Czech Republic.

While economic research on the impact of government purchases has flourished, in the data, most of the increase in expenditures was in government transfers. After documenting this fact, we argue that future research should focus on the positive impact of transfers. Towards this, we present a model in which there is no representative agent and Ricardian equivalence does not hold because of uncertainty, imperfect credit markets, and nominal rigidities. Targeted lump-sum transfers are expansionary both because of a neoclassical wealth effect and because of a Keynesian aggregate demand effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The setup is a real option model where the amount of emissions is determined by solving the firm's profit maximization problem under each policy instrument. The regulator solves an optimal stopping problem in order to find the critical threshold for policy adoptions taking into account revenues from taxes and auctioned permits and government spending. In this framework we find the ranking of the alternative policy options in terms of their adoption lag and social welfare. We show that when the output demand is elastic, emission standards are preferred to freely allocated permits. Taxes and auctioned permits are always equivalent in terms of their adoption lag and social welfare, and also equivalent to emission standards when the regulator redistributes revenues.","[Agliardi, Elettra; Sereno, Luigi] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Agliardi, Elettra] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Agliardi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",elettra.agliardi@unibo.it; luigi.sereno@unibo.it,,"SERENO, Luigi/0000-0001-5809-0318; agliardi, elettra/0000-0001-9950-1152",,,,,23,1,1,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The equilibrium outcome of the model results in a first-mover advantage where the first-moving firm produces more output, and earns larger profits, relative to the second-moving firm. Huck, Muller, and Normann (2001) and Huck and Wallace (2002) test the Stackelberg duopoly in a lab setting and find that behavior is largely inconsistent with the equilibrium predictions of the model. We hypothesize that this inconsistency is a result of differences between the decision making environment implemented in the lab and firm environments in the field. In this paper, we experimentally investigate whether group decision making and a decision cooling-off period lead to more profit maximizing Stackelberg behavior in the lab. Specifically, we re-test the Stackelberg duopoly in the lab while implementing (i) two-person decision making groups, and (ii) a 10-min cooling-off period for second movers. In line with the previous studies, we find that second-mover response behavior is largely inconsistent with profit maximization. Furthermore, the implementation of groups and a cooling-off period has little effect on second-mover behavior. However, we find that group first-movers choose significantly lower output levels than individuals. While further from the equilibrium prediction, we show that these lower output choices by groups are more in-line with profit maximizing behavior, conditional on the non-profit maximizing response behavior of second-movers.

Second, we identify the surprise component of policy communication directly from market commentaries and assess its impact on the term structure of interest rates. We find that the response of the yield curve to policy statements has become highly significant for the unanticipated changes in the monetary policy communication, especially after the implementation of the IT.

Rich countries have lower corruption, and the perception of free expression and accountability strongly decreases corruption, indicating that providing greater opportunities for citizens to participate in selecting their government, more freedom of expression, and free media are effective ways of curbing corruption.

As in classical models, the principal offers a pay-per-performance wage to the agent, determining the agent's extrinsic incentives. However, in our model, the principal uses goal setting policies as a tool to manage agents' intrinsic motivation. To capture the idea that different agents respond differently to different goals we introduce the concept of personal standards which determine what becomes challenging and rewarding to them, and hence the intensity of their intrinsic motivation to achieve goals. We show that, at the optimal contract, the agents' production, as well as the goals set by the principal, increase with the agents' personal standards. Moreover, we show that an intrinsically motivated agent gets higher surplus than an agent with no intrinsic motivation in the form of informational rents but an agent with a mid-ranged standard (and hence productivity) could end up being the one most satisfied. Therefore, our model can be helpful to explain some empirical findings in the literature of job satisfaction such as the so called paradox of happiness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The increased availability of foreign borrowing may make it easier for countries to pursue bellicose policies by altering the costbenefit calculations associated with international conflict, giving rise to an underappreciated link between globalization and military action. This has not been addressed because globalization is most often approached through the income statement, such as trade flows, or the asset side of the balance sheet, such as foreign direct investment.

We provide empirical evidence on the determinants of target leverage and the speed of adjustment. More specifically, the rate of financial flexibility, growth opportunities and size are positively related to the speed of adjustment, whereas the distance to the optimal ratio of debt shows a negative impact. Our findings demonstrate that, in terms of sample mean, a high percentage of Spanish SMEs adjust rationally to their target.

Using nested logit models and a sample of 6,118 distress-related exits in Belgium, we analyze the type of exit that distressed firms experience. We show that 41% of the firms in our sample exit through a court driven exit procedure (mainly bankruptcy), 44% are voluntarily liquidated and 14% are acquired, merged or split (hereafter M&A). Distressed firm exit follows two distinct stages. First, a firm either decides to exit voluntarily or is forced into bankruptcy, which is the least efficient exit strategy. Compared to bankruptcy, the probability of a voluntary exit increases with higher levels of cash, lower leverage, holding no secured debt and being embedded in a group. If a firm exits voluntarily, it enters a second stage and decides either to exit through voluntary liquidation or through a M&A. Conditional on not going bankrupt, the likelihood of voluntary liquidation compared to M&A increases with higher levels of cash or secured debt, with smaller size and with an absence of group relations. We contribute to the firm exit literature by jointly analyzing three exit types and showing that bankruptcy and voluntary liquidation are fundamentally different exit routes. While voluntary liquidation is an important exit route for distressed firms, most previous studies have failed to distinguish between bankruptcy and liquidation. We hence contribute to the exit literature by showing that bankruptcy, voluntary liquidation and M&A are fundamentally distinct exit routes for distressed firms, driven by different firm level characteristics and following a two-stage process.","[Manigart, Sophie; Ooghe, Hubert] Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Balcaen, Sofie; Manigart, Sophie; Buyze, Jozefien; Ooghe, Hubert] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Vlerick Business School; Ghent University,"Manigart, S (通讯作者)，Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, Reep 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Sophie.manigart@vlerick.be,"Buyze, Jozefien/B-8550-2014","Buyze, Jozefien/0000-0001-6780-380X; Manigart, Sophie/0000-0002-3406-9386",,,,,67,71,80,2,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Often such research efforts have been conducted as part of wider studies of social exclusion to public transport opportunities. This paper aims to explore the use of floating catchment analysis (FCA) techniques to measure access to public transport opportunities. Whilst FCA methods have been used to measure access to health, employment and leisure services in particular, there have been few studies focused on their potential for measuring access to public transport services. This study builds on previous research concerned with enhancing the FCA methodology to include aspects of proximity to bus stops, the balance between service supply and demand, and cumulative opportunity. We compare FCA-based access measures with both census-derived data and small area geodemographic classifications in order to explore intra-urban variations in accessibility and potential associations with existing socio-economic patterns. Our findings for the city of Cardiff, UK highlight no strong associations with potential measures of social exclusion, and points to evidence that deprived areas within the city are actually better served in terms of the provision of public transport opportunities than some affluent areas. These findings contrast with previous studies which have found disparities between transport supply and social needs. We suggest enhanced FCA measures have real potential in studies of transport-related social exclusion in identifying locations where services should be provided in relation to potential demand as well as in monitoring the implications of placing new routes and access points.

In a survey concerning landscape externalities of onshore wind power in central Germany, respondents answered the same five choice sets at two different points in time. Each choice set comprised three alternatives described by five attributes, and the time interval between the test and the retest was eleven months. The analysis takes place at three different levels, investigating choice consistency at the choice task level and repeatability of the latent construct utility at the level of parametric models as well as at the level of willingness-to-pay estimates. At the choice task level we observed 59% identical choices. The parametric analysis shows that the test and retest estimates are not equal, even when we control for scale, that is, differences in the error variance. However, comparing the marginal willingness-to-pay estimates among test and retest reveals only a statistically significant difference for one of the attributes. Overall, this indicates a moderate test-retest reliability taking into account that consistency at the choice task level overlooks the stochastic nature of the process underlying discrete choice experiments.","[Liebe, Ulf] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Liebe, Ulf] Univ Kassel, Dept Rural Sociol, Witzenhausen, Germany; [Meyerhoff, Juergen; Hartje, Volkmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape & Environm Planning, Berlin, Germany",University of Gottingen; Universitat Kassel; Technical University of Berlin,"Liebe, U (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",uliebe@uni-goettingen.de,"Meyerhoff, Juergen/M-5640-2019","Meyerhoff, Juergen/0000-0003-4333-8514",,,,,37,58,59,1,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Though the multiple lenses have produced important insights, they have not always defined the phenomenon in terms that can easily be translated from one discipline to another. Operational definitions differ. Convenience samples may suffer from retrospective biases. However, representative samples are expensive to gather. The Panel Studies of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) are almost alone in examining the actions of entrepreneurs at the time they are organizing their businesses. This Special Issue presents a selected set of refereed papers involving the Norwegian PSED (NPSED) and Swedish PSEDs (SPSED) as well as PSED I and PSED II from the USA.

When the net benefits of environmental policy are uncertain, a country which participates in negotiating an environmental treaty, or which supports strong environmental action, thereby provides information to another country that such action can be worthwhile. This dimension of international environmental agreements helps explain why countries negotiate treaties, why these treaties often implement the Nash non-cooperative equilibrium, why agreement to a treaty by a country deemed not particularly favorable to it can strengthen environmental action, and why treaties may invoke a minimum participation clause. The informational mechanism we discuss holds even if physical spillovers are absent, and even if monitoring and enforcement are infeasible. Our approach can explain additional phenomena: how requirements for approval by several bodies within a country can increase support for a policy, and why simultaneous action can lead to better outcomes than sequential action.","[Glazer, Amihai] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92617 USA; [Proost, Stef] KULeuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",University of California System; University of California Irvine; KU Leuven,"Glazer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92617 USA.",aglazer@uci.edu; Stef.proost@econ.kuleuven.be,,"Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",,,,,35,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This is especially true for forecasts conditional on SPF nowcasts, in which case the forecasting power of the DSGE turns out to be similar or better than that of the SPF for all the variables and horizons.

Using panel logit models we find that a banking crisis will be sparked by the collapse of a real asset bubble. While such bubbles are associated with popular stories of a new era and an increasingly deregulated financial system, in most cases, this would occur even in the absence of sustained surges of capital inflow, accumulation of public debt, low interest rate policies, or structural shocks.

Although it was used by about 70% of the population and included 30 private operators of collective transport, who offered services for 233 routes utilising a variety of different vehicles, regulation was limited and often did not cover routes, stops, and frequencies. In 2009, the Masivo Integrado de Occidente (MIO), a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system came into operation, as a cost-effective transport alternative for urban mobility. This article examines the relationship between social exclusion and transport in Santiago de Cali and demonstrates that there is still room for improvement in aspects of spatial coverage and for a greater focus on the factors which explain the social need for transport which are not usually considered within planning. To this end, the theoretical framework for accessibility, social exclusion and provision of public transport is set out and the subject area of study is described. Later in the article an index of social transport needs is drawn up and another index, demonstrating the provision of public transport is presented in such a way as to highlight the difference between the two, expressing the spatial gap between need and supply. The results indicate that the BRT system can improve its services by implementing specific measures which take into account the socio-economic factors that largely explain the social transport needs of Santiago de Cali.

It introduces an input-oriented generalized metafrontier Malmquist productivity index (I-gMMPI), while considering the latent effect of risk-taking behavior in the analytic framework. We learn that public and private banks should face separate short-term technological frontiers, while the econometric model considering risk input can portray banks' operating frontiers better. Moreover, neglecting the influence of risk input would bring about distortions of efficiency, technology and TFP dynamic estimations for banks; meanwhile, the degree of scale economies would also be overestimated. The paper concludes that neglecting the risk-taking essence in bank performance evaluation is equal to allowing banks to barter risk-bearing as the term for further output growth. Consequently, the potential cost is that banks may excessively aggrandize their scales of business, implying the possibility of another financial crisis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the ban did nothing to affect order flows: financial stocks were being more aggressively sold off than their peers pre-ban and this situation persisted through the ban period. Trading volume in financials was massively reduced, however. The ban decimated order book liquidity for financials. The deterioration was symmetric, affecting the limit buy and limit sell side of the order book equally. Finally we show that, through the period of the ban, markets for financial stocks were substantially less efficient and that the role of the trading process in aiding price discovery was greatly reduced. The effects identified above were largely reversed once the ban was lifted. The persistence of the deterioration in market quality and liquidity though the relatively long-lasting UK ban on short selling suggests that other major market developments such as the TARP program were not responsible since these were concentrated in the early half of the ban. We thus argue that the short selling ban was responsible for detrimental effects on the quality of UK equity markets and that, far from being stabilising, the ban exacerbated problems in valuing UK financial stocks.

Thus, spatio-temporal constraints are indispensable in specifying a realistic choice set. Failure to take into account such constraints results in misspecification of shopping alternatives, erroneous inferences, and misunderstanding of individual travel behavior. However, due to lack of data, heavy computational burden, and algorithm complexity, spatio-temporal constraints have often been ignored in shopping destination choice modeling. In our study, we use the potential path area, which is the projection of a space-time prism onto a plane, to determine an individual's destination choice set given their spatio-temporal constraints. In this way, the destination choice set is a more realistic representation of the shopping alternatives available to the individual. We select 616 shopping trips from a travel survey conducted in five counties of the Louisville KY-IN MSA in 2000, and aggregate shopping opportunities to traffic analysis zones (TAZs) for analysis. Multinomial logit models are estimated to understand the determinants of shopping destination choice. The results are compared to those of a conventional, unconstrained destination choice model.

This program selected several villages each year to draft and implement their own original development plans. I discuss the implications of the features of the program on its effectiveness. A detailed baseline survey conducted by the villagers themselves helped them to objectively diagnose their economic situations and understand their issues. The plans defined clear numerical targets, allowing them to share goals and monitor progress. The implementation of the plan was reinforced by frequent communication and monitoring among neighbors and by an incentive scheme that involved competition within a village. I use a village-level panel dataset from Hyogo Prefecture to examine the effects, under the difference-in-differences strategy. I find suggestive evidence that the program helped foster the adoption of cattle raising and diversify agricultural production.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Arimoto, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,,,,,30,2,3,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

The large number of employees in the public sector can be one of the causes for economic instability at country level. That is particularly visible in the context of the euro zone crisis and economic/political instability in countries like Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy. Our approach is based on the statistical analysis of productivity oscillation and setting of performance standards in public and public utility enterprises based on the aforementioned productivity. Data background is given through job descriptions, organizational charts, salary reports and monthly performance reports, in most cases part of organizational information systems. It is recommended for quantitative data to be analyzed on a monthly basis, during a period of 30 or more months. Our method increases procedural fairness and accuracy, because quantitative, statistical, impartial and objective approach is applied for estimating parameters which could be related to downsizing. However, the application of this method is not limited to downsizing, as during its application in more than 20 public and public utility enterprises it was sometimes applied to increase output or reduce costs not necessarily connected to labour. Although it finally refers to downsizing, this method can provide fairer and more impartial approach than the subjective estimate of employee surplus, and its arbitral distribution within the enterprise.","[Savoiu, Gheorghe] Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania; [Cudanov, Mladen; Jasko, Ondrej] Univ Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; University of Belgrade,"Savoiu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania.",gsavoiu@yahoo.com,"Cudanov, Mladen/G-8715-2018; Săvoiu, Gheorghe/C-3569-2013","Cudanov, Mladen/0000-0001-6895-6525; Săvoiu, Gheorghe/0000-0002-9596-793X; Jasko, Ondrej/0000-0003-4877-0592",,,,,39,18,18,0,35,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2012,14.0,32,,,,,307,322,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964ED,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305675600002,0

Typically, the number of employees decreases by 4.45% three years after a merger, even after changes in sales and other variables are controlled. Firms that experience related mergers, and rescue mergers are more likely to decrease the number of workers. At the same time, wages increase by 5.46% per employee.

Building on these findings, the paper proposes using more decreasingly absolute risk averse or more prudent as alternative definitions of increased downside risk aversion.

Results show that JFM effectively reduced bushmeat hunting thus facilitating wildlife recovery but with negative consequences for hunters' livelihoods.

We find that this type of signal increases the frequency of correct assessments and that prediction accuracy is higher for lower levels of risk. We also show that prediction accuracy is higher after invalidating signals (i.e. signals that contradict the initial belief).

We find that diversified firms hold a higher fraction of corporate liquidity in the form of bank lines of credit due to the coinsurance effect.

Initial findings indicate that differences across cultural dimensions act as a leveling effect but not as long run growth determinants. In addition, when controlling for physical and human capital accumulation, culture plays a much smaller role in explaining differences in income per capita than initially thought, with little effect on output per worker growth along the transitional dynamics path.

To achieve urban sustainability, new models for the management of urban freight movements are needed, in which local authorities play a pro-active role. The aim of this paper is to contribute to lay the groundwork for designing strategies to overcome the challenges involved in sustainable urban freight transport. This paper is based on a multiple-case study analysing the current state of urban freight transport and current planning practices in cities around the Baltic Sea. While the cities differ in size, economy, and political and cultural frameworks, the transport sector plays a strong role in all cities. In-depth freight interviews with public and private stakeholders were conducted and complemented with several holistic interview sessions and document analysis. Potentials and shortcomings in urban freight transport planning are presented and the results show that freight transport is increasingly important for regional competitiveness while freight traffic is a growing threat for urban sustainability. In turn, the urban context is a barrier for efficient freight operations. However, both local authorities and transport operators neglect the problems that arise from freight in urban areas. An overall awareness is needed to understand that a deeper integration of freight transport and urban sustainability strategies can be beneficial for both the efficiency of freight transport networks and for local sustainability. City authorities need more logistics competence to facilitate the required integration between private and public actors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to identify air traveller perceptions of different airlines with regard to green image, and how passengers perceive different measures that airlines can introduce to reduce their environmental impact. The research is based on a large quantitative survey, of over 600 air travellers, conducted at Liverpool John Lennon Airport between April and July 2010. The data in this papers stems from a range of attitudinal statements on airlines, and measures that airlines could adopt to improve their environmental performance. When presented with a list of airlines, about half of respondents were able to differentiate between airlines based on environmental friendliness. The results show that low-cost airlines in general are not seen as more or less environmentally friendly than full service network airlines. Yet air travellers do indicate differences in the environmental image based on individual airlines. Furthermore, results vary depending on whether passengers had flown previously with a particular airline. Passengers also differentiate between measures that airlines can adopt to reduce the environmental impact of aviation. Using newer aircraft is seen as the most effective way to address the issue.

I show that investment flows' response to fees cannot be fully explained by looking at investors' performance sensitivity. While performance sensitivity monotonically increases with past performance, price sensitivity does not: investors who buy top past performers seem to be distracted by the fund's previous return and pay relatively little attention to the expense ratios. Moreover price sensitivity increases with fund visibility while performance sensitivity decreases, and while looking at data from 1986 to 2006 no discernible trend can be observed in the average performance sensitivity, price sensitivity strongly increases due to the dramatic increase in the availability of mutual funds' information for retail investors. Finally I show that investment companies strategically time their repricing decisions in order to exploit time variations in price and performance sensitivities, and that fund governance quality affects the degree to which investment companies engage in this opportunistic behavior.

First, debt maturity that is too short-term is inefficient, even with incentive provision. The optimal maturity is an interior solution that avoids excessive rollover risk while providing sufficient incentives for the manager to avoid risk-shifting when the firm is in good health. Second, allowing the manager to risk-shift during a freeze actually increases creditor confidence. Debt policy should not prevent the manager from holding what may appear to be otherwise low-mean strategies that have option value during a freeze. Third, a limited but not perfectly reliable form of emergency financing during a freeze-a bailout-may improve the terms of the trade-off and increase total ex ante value by instilling confidence in the creditor markets.

First, the dynamics of the conditional correlation of only the 2-year maturity differs from those of other maturities. These patterns might be explained by the fact that a 2-year maturity is easily affected by market forecasts of monetary policy changes by the Federal Reserve Board. Second, the financial crisis dummies (xi(1)) are all negative in particular with significance at the 5% level for 7 year, 10 year, and 30 year maturities.

For a central bank with multiple target variables such as the Federal Reserve's 'dual mandate', a target rule expresses the desired values for each target and the relative weight given to each. The so-called Taylor rule, in which the central bank chooses how to respond to the output gap and inflation, is an example of an instrument rule. This paper sets out the parameters of 'optimal' target and instrument rules and analyses their relative merits. In contrast to Svensson and Woodford, we find that target rules offer no clear advantages over optimal instrument rules. From a policy perspective, this suggests that the case for target rules has been overstated. The use of optimal instrument rules accords with current Federal Reserve practice where by the federal funds rate responds to optimal forecasts-those using all available information.","[Froyen, Richard T.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Guender, Alfred V.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ, Christchurch 1, New Zealand",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Canterbury,"Froyen, RT (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",froyen@email.unc.edu,,"Guender, Alfred/0000-0001-6234-5643",,,,,40,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We trace the origins of the high hopes placed in this technology by industry and policymakers alike, and show how the large number of demonstration projects required for a breakthrough did not follow. We then identify possible explanations for the lost decade, such as incumbent resistance to structural change, wrong technology choices, over-optimistic cost estimates, a premature focus on energy projects instead of industry, and the underestimation of transport and storage issues. We conclude it is likely that we have to live for quite some time with a cognitive dissonance in which top-down models continue to place hope in the CCTS-technology by reducing its expected fixed and variable costs, and bottom-up researchers continue to count failed pilot projects.","[Von Hirschhausen, Christian; Herold, Johannes; Oei, Pao-Yu] Berlin Univ Technol, WIP, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Von Hirschhausen, Christian] DIW Berlin German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Von Hirschhausen, C (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, WIP, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",,,"Oei, Pao-Yu/0000-0001-6638-0147",,,,,14,43,46,0,15,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

The overall results from the three error-correction based Granger causality models show that there is an evidence of unidirectional short-run, long-run and strong causalities running from the electricity consumption per capita to real GDP per capita. But, there is no causal evidence from the real GDP per capita to electricity consumption per capita. In other words, Growth hypothesis is confirmed in Turkey.

We consider a rational model of a mutual fund tournament in the presence of short-sale constraints and find the opposite: Interim winners choose more volatile portfolios in equilibrium than interim losers. Several empirical works present evidence consistent with our model. However, based on the above informal argument, they appear to conclude against the tournament behavior. We argue that this conclusion is unwarranted. We also demonstrate that tournament incentives lead to differences in interim performance for otherwise identical managers and that mid-year trading volume is inversely related to mid-year stock return.

We show that the impact of trading costs on the strategies' profitability can largely be attributed to excessively trading in small cap stocks. Limiting the stock universe to large cap stocks significantly reduces trading costs. Applying a more sophisticated portfolio construction algorithm to lower turnover reduces trading costs even further. Our finding that reversal strategies generate 30-50 basis points per week net of trading costs poses a serious challenge to standard rational asset pricing models. Our findings also have important implications for the understanding and practical implementation of reversal strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Research examining children's behavior has shown that the tendency to share half of one's endowment increases with age between the ages of 3 and 8. However, the satisfaction the children derive from their decisions (to share half of their endowments) has yet to be examined. I present two studies (using the dictator and ultimatum games) suggesting that young children (5-6 years old) are aware of the norms of fairness but choose to act selfishly and prefer not to share. Slightly older children aged 7-8 adopt these norms in their actual behavior but do not feel happier when they share half of their endowments than when they share less than half. Finally, true inequity aversion only appears at the ages of 9-10, when children not only give more, but they correspondingly also feel better when their endowments are equally divided.

Once applied in the results section, the extended method manages to quantify the broad outline of a reactive profile, slightly lagging and inertial, of the external marketing / foreign trade of the national economy, in relation to crisis or recession in both time analyses, which is relatively stable for eight decades, providing space for comments that allow greater macro-economic self-awareness. The main final remark shows that a small starting gap, apparently favourable, of Romanian foreign trade, in response to crisis or recession type phenomena, cannot however compensate the inertial trend of these cyclic phenomena, which is slightly longer than one year, and whose negative impact is strongly felt and amplified.","[Savoiu, Gheorghe] Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania; [Dinu, Vasile; Tachiciu, Laurentiu] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Savoiu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania.",gheorghe.savoiu@upit.ro,"Săvoiu, Gheorghe/C-3569-2013; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017","Săvoiu, Gheorghe/0000-0002-9596-793X; Tachiciu, Laurentiu/0000-0002-2566-0342; Dinu, Vasile/0000-0003-3606-2548",,,,,97,14,15,0,36,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2012,14.0,31,,,,,173,194,,,,,,22,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,900SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300910600013,0

Our results confirm that the level of MRO rates governed short-term money market rates before the financial crisis. Since the start of the financial crisis, however, the information content of MRO rates has changed. While the levels of MRO rates have lost much of their pre-crisis significance, the spread between the weighted average and the marginal MRO rate has become an important barometer for the actual situation in the money market during the crisis.

Also the sectors that could most benefit the economic development of the Vysocina Region were revealed. To perform the analysis a regional input-output table was constructed by using GRIT methodology. The economic contribution of agriculture is not insignificant. An increase of agricultural production has not underlying influence on total regional production, however, it can positively affects regional incomes. The reduction of agricultural activities could lead to significant losses in income and employment in agriculture and consequential sectors and inhibit regional development. The strong relationship between agriculture and food processing industry can increase regional income and employment subsequently. Machinery, basic metals, construction, tourism and food processing industry play the significant role in the economic structure and can contribute to an increase of income, employment and production in Vysocina Region.","Inst Agr Econ & Informat, CZ-12056 Prague 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Bednaríková, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 75, CZ-12056 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",bednarikova.zuzana@uzei.cz,,,,,,,40,5,5,1,20,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In the short run, the technology should pave the way for increased consumption, asset accumulation, and reduced persistent poverty among users. Over the longer run, it should lead to institutional feedbacks that support sustained economic development and nutritional improvements. Our conceptual model and review of case studies reveal the importance of three sub-components of irrigation technology-access, distribution, and use-and the ways in which the design of the technology itself can either bridge, or succumb to, institutional gaps. These critical features are illustrated in an experimental evaluation of a solar-powered drip irrigation project in rural northern Benin, which provides a controlled study of technology impacts in the Sudano-Sahel. The combined evidence highlights the technical and institutional requirements for project success and points to two important areas of research in the scale-up of any small-scale irrigation strategy: the risk behavior of water users, and the evolution of institutions that either support or obstruct project replication over space and time.

Under a single class share structure, the incumbent has a greater chance of losing control to potential rivals if he undertakes the project with high near-term uncertainty, since outsiders may vote for the rival if they believe the project is not progressing well. A dual class share structure allows the incumbent to have enough votes to prevail against any rival, but may be misused by untalented incumbents to dissipate value.

In general, GIs draw attention to product quality, local identity and cultural traditions such as Champagne, Cuban Cigars, Roquefort Cheese, Turkish Carpet etc. GIs provide differentiated and high value-added products to local producers in the rural areas while the willingness of the purchasing these kind of traditional products are high. The way of benefit from the marketing power of GIs is an effective registration system and also active marketing process is required to gain a place in domestic and world market.

Planners and policy makers are looking for ways to reverse the trend through such programs as Safe Routes to School. However, the research on school travel mirrors the policies in leaving important gaps: most studies focus on elementary students rather than high school students, and many focus on walking rather than bicycling. This study addresses both of these gaps. Our goal is to provide a better understanding of what encourages or discourages bicycling among high school students using data from a 2009 survey of students at Davis High School in Davis, CA. The analysis points to individual, social-environment, and physical-environment factors as important in explaining bicycling to school for high school students. Parental encouragement and the student's comfort with bicycling are key factors, and perceived distance is more strongly associated with bicycling than actual distance. These results suggest the need for multi-pronged efforts to increase bicycling among high school students. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The main goal of customer lifetime value is to specify the importance level of each customer for a company. Such questions as what sort of marketing strategies should be preferred for which customers, how much investments should be made for them and which marketing campaigns should be followed can all be determined by calculating lifetime value of customers. Many researchers have proposed different types of models for calculating customer lifetime value. Yet, the related literature lacks of comparative research on assessing the existing models, especially within the scope of segmentation. This paper aims at providing a classification for the current models in the literature based on their basic characteristics and making a comparison between two representative models from different classes using the same database.

The nonstandard models under investigation extend both the observation process and the volatility-generating process of basic SV models. In particular, we consider dependent as well as independent mixtures of autoregressive components as the log-volatility process, and include in the observation equation a lower bound on the volatility. We also consider an experimental SV model that is based on conditionally gamma-distributed volatilities. Our estimation method is based on the fact that an SV model can be approximated arbitrarily accurately by a hidden Markov model (HMM), whose likelihood is easy to compute and to maximize. The method is close, but not identical, to those of Fridman and Harris (1998), Bartolucci and De Luca (2001,2003) and Clements et al. (2006), and makes explicit the useful link between HMMs and the methods of those authors. Likelihood-based estimation of the parameters of SV models is usually regarded as challenging because the likelihood is a high-dimensional multiple integral. The HMM approximation is easy to implement and particularly convenient for fitting experimental extensions and variants of SV models such as those we introduce here. In addition, and in contrast to the case of SV models themselves, simple formulae are available for the forecast distributions of HMMs, for computing appropriately defined residuals, and for decoding, i.e. estimating the volatility of the process.

These changes have heightened MUI's influence and the legal authority of its fatwa, granting it new institutional roles (and, in some cases, monopolies) in relation to halal certification, Islamic finance and the haj pilgrimage.

Regression modelling showed that fertiliser use was influenced by household and farm characteristics. In addition, it was also influenced by social and human capital and farmers' perceptions of the effect of fertilisers on soil fertility. Farmers who perceived fertilisers as bad for their soil were less likely to adopt their use. This is a key result, as the emerging discussions on a green revolution for Africa, as well as the continued food crisis discussion, are prompting increased fertiliser use as an immediate intervention for increasing nutrient inputs into agriculture in the developing world. Increased policy efforts should be placed not only on increasing access to fertilisers but also on evolving farmers' perceptions and attitudes towards fertiliser use.","[Mapila, M. A. T.

Many providers will disappear; in the race to leadership, vendors will bring to market immature technologies; some mergers and acquisitions will fail; some vendors will not be able to effectively scale up their platforms to support large cloud workloads; and other vendors will struggle to provide quality support to a growing number of clients.

After the FTA, patent lifetimes are expected to be extended. During such extension periods, Korean generic drug makers will not be able to sell their drugs, and consumers will have to pay more because of higher prices. The new concepts of effective patent term and price-change mechanism were employed, and patent data for the Korean pharmaceutical industry were used to estimate the parameters needed to measure the welfare effects. The empirical results indicate that the welfare effect will be much smaller than suggested by previous studies. These methods to evaluate the welfare effects can be applied to the cases of other recent FTAs and other kinds of IPR negotiations in international economics.","[Oh, Keun-Yeob] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Taejon, South Korea; [Kim, Taegi] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Kwangju 500757, South Korea",Chungnam National University; Chonnam National University,"Kim, T (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Yongbong Dong, Kwangju 500757, South Korea.",tgkim@chonnam.ac.kr,,"Oh, Keunyeob/0000-0001-6553-9021",,,,,13,1,1,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

This paper explores how the educational externality could be internalized to establish a viable market for these services. We focused on educational dairy farms in Japan and used a questionnaire survey to quantitatively evaluate the attitudes of operators toward establishing viable services. First, a conceptual framework was presented to express operators' orientation toward an economically viable service by incorporating a stepwise internalization process of positive externalities with the help of a social learning network. Then, empirically, statistical tests were conducted and factors that determined this orientation, a viable service determinant function, were explored by the ordered logit model. The result showed that, first, the higher the number of visitors to the farm, the more operators were oriented toward a viable service while no connection with ordinary dairy production was shown. Second, social learning was effective for initiating the internalization process. Third, marketing skills became more important for upgrading the internalization level. Consequently, it is important to create opportunities for those farmers who want to provide consumers with educational services to learn a new role for agriculture and to establish a new income source in a stepwise fashion.",,,,,"Ohe, Yasuo/K-1096-2019",,,,,,45,0,0,2,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,227,244,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800016,0

Using the Spanish social security system as a case study, a duration analysis is implemented to look for a causal relationship and then estimate separately the effects of an effective retirement age delay and a replacement rate reduction as well as the combined effect of these two measures. We also estimate the effects of a delay on the reforms. We find that a change in the effective retirement age would have positive effects on the individual welfare of retired population, while a reduction of the replacement rate would diminish it. The combined effect of the two measures would finally translate into a welfare lost of the retired population. The delay on the reforms implies higher welfare loss (to the affected generations) than the analyzed reforms.","[Peinado, Patricia; Serrano, Felipe] Univ Basque Country, Madrid, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Peinado, P (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Madrid, Spain.",patricia.peinado@ehu.es,"Serrano, Felipe/X-9303-2019; PEINADO, PATRICIA/X-9419-2019","Serrano, Felipe/0000-0002-5993-7178; PEINADO, PATRICIA/0000-0001-5494-4830",,,,,18,5,6,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

We re-examine some of the early papers in the literature using recent data and find that the empirical support for the theory of normal backwardation as an explanation for the commodity risk premium is weak and that the evidence is more consistent with storage decisions. We then review the behavior of the main participants in the commodity futures markets with a particular focus on their impact on prices. Although there is continued disagreement in the literature about the role of speculative activity, our results show that money managers are generally momentum (positive feedback) traders, while producers are net short and contrarian (negative feedback) traders. There is less evidence that index traders and swap dealers trade based on past futures returns.","[Rouwenhorst, K.

The authors examine the historical forces behind three changes that the project sought to reverse, namely the abandonment by cheese makers of the Merino breed, the move away from aging the cheese on straw mats in the cheese room rafters to aging in refrigerated stores, and the sale of younger, softer cheeses. The authors contend that the pursuit of these aims by the project ironically contradicts Slow Food's stated aims of fostering the production of food that is good, clean and fair. The paper concludes not only that more rigorous historical analysis exposes Slow Food's romanticism and elitism, but also that such analysis is necessary to the improvement of the food we eat.","[West, Harry G.] Univ London, Food Studies Ctr, SOAS, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Domingos, Nuno] Univ Lisbon, Inst Ciencias Sociais, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal","University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon (ICS-UL); Universidade de Lisboa","West, HG (通讯作者)，Univ London, Food Studies Ctr, SOAS, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England.",harry.west@soas.ac.uk; nuno.domingos@ics.ul.pt,"domingos, nuno/M-5333-2013; Domingos, Nuno Miguel Rodrigues/AAC-4827-2021","domingos, nuno/0000-0003-1616-6710; Domingos, Nuno Miguel Rodrigues/0000-0003-1616-6710",,,,,57,35,42,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The reduction in agricultural productivity reduces overall food availability and ultimately impacts food accessibility, putting millions of people at risk for malnutrition. In this project we focus on Kenya where roughly a third of households are food insecure. We examine the relationship of the price of maize and low birth weight to help quantify the impact of local food prices on one outcome of household food insecurity. Using spatially referenced data from recent Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey datasets, price data, livelihood information, and a remotely sensed-based measure of local growing season productivity, we develop a dataset linking pregnancies occurring from 2001 to 2008 to the spatially and temporally relevant maize price data. We construct several regression models to examine the impact of local maize prices and remotely sensed based estimates of crop production on infant birth weight - specifically low birth weight. The results of the models highlight the importance of including community crop production to evaluate maize price impacts on low birth weight outcomes. Also, because of the positive correlation between pre-pregnancy maize prices and birth weight, the results suggest that some households may benefit from high prices or that high prices may impact the number of conceptions. More generally, our work demonstrates that multilevel models that account for community-level variation are important for disentangling these complex relationships and can contribute to the discussion of how to design more effective food policies.

This has impacted Indian agriculture and farmers as supermarkets reorganize supply chains towards more explicit forms of coordination. Compared to other developing countries, little has been said in the Indian context about what role farmer organizations can play to help smallholder farmers specifically, improve their position in those emerging value chains.

In this review article, we examine evidence on the economic and nutritional impacts of international food assistance programs (FAPs) and policies. The returns on investments in FAPs are, on average, high but depend considerably on the targeting and cost structures as well as on food quality and role of complementary activities. We disaggregate findings into four classes of recipients. Returns to FAPs are highest for children under two. But, FAPs oriented towards early childhood interventions are less well funded than are interventions aimed at school-age children or at the broader, largely adult population even though available evidence indicates that these latter classes of interventions offer considerably lower average returns in economic, health, and nutrition terms. Nonetheless, FAP effectiveness in achieving any of several objectives varies with a range of key factors, including targeting, additionality, seasonality, timeliness, incentive effects, social acceptability and political economy considerations.

About half of the 408 participants were exposed to diet-related health information before performing either a choice or a ranking task, while a control group did not receive such information. The effects of health information on marginal willingness to pay for low-saturated-fat, low-fat and organic cheese are analyzed using rank-ordered mixed logit models. Cheese preferences are clearly affected by exposure to health information. On average, the health information group is willing to pay a price premium of 27.2% (NOK 24.5 per kg) for low-saturated-fat cheese and 14.4% (NOK 13.0 per kg) for low-fat cheese. This is respectively 1.73 and 2.89 times more than corresponding price premiums in the control group. Non-college, medium-high income, age 50-70 and female participants are more clearly affected by health information than college, low income, age 30-49 and male participants. Subjective statements on diet-health knowledge and awareness are used to discuss these findings. Our results suggest that provision of health information is likely to reduce educational differences in diet-health knowledge and thus dietary behavior. Low income participants seem to be constrained by high food prices, but not by lack of knowledge or awareness. Finally, due to lack of diet-health awareness, reaching out to young people and particularly males through health information policies seems difficult. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents an analysis of GlobalGAP adoption by small-scale fruit and vegetable farmers in Thailand focusing on GlobalGAP group certification, the costs and perceived benefits of GlobalGAP adoption, and the factors influencing standard adoption. In our research area. GlobalGAP group certification has encouraged the formation of new institutional arrangements between farmers, exporters and donors. Farmers participating in a development program were organized in certification groups where the Quality Management System (QMS) was either run by the donor, by the exporter, or by farmers themselves. Results of our adoption model suggest that support by donors, exporters and public-private partnerships are vital to enable small-scale farmers to adopt the standard.

Amarender; Bantilan, Ma Cynthia S.",,,Competitiveness and technical efficiency: Determinants in the groundnut oil sector of India,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE; FARMERS; TECHNOLOGY,"India imports about half of its domestic consumption needs of edible oils. Groundnuts are a major source of edible oils in India. One of the central problems of groundnut production and processing is huge inefficiencies due to an uncertain production environment owing to rainfed cultivation, the low resource base of smallholder farmers and processors, and the low adoption rates of improved technology. This paper addresses critical issues that impair the groundnut sector's international competitiveness and efficiency. The paper uses primary data collected from Indian farmers and processors of groundnuts to measure efficiency, and it suggests policies for reducing yield gaps and increasing efficiency. Specific policies suggested from the study are (a) the harnessing of improved varieties with attributes like drought tolerance, high oil content, high productivity for large-scale seed multiplication and distribution by public and private agencies; (b) viable village seed banks and seed networks through cycles of post-rainy season seed multiplication to meet the seed requirements in the rainy season and vice versa; (c) adoption of low-cost technologies to increase profitability and reduce risk; (d) oilseed clusters to facilitate scale and scope economies in processing units; and (e) capital subsidies to accelerate technological upgrading to shed inefficiency in the processing sector. The expected gains in efficiency in the production and processing of oilseeds are expected to result in producer and consumer gains which would justify the proposed incentives for seeds and for technological upgrading in the processing sector.

We determine the extent of harmonization as perceived by exporters with respect to the major Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPSs) and quality measures which Chile faces in 16 international fresh fruit markets. The methodology combined qualitative and quantitative techniques. First, the most relevant safety and quality standards and regulations were identified and ranked. Second, a representative sample of exporters was interviewed to assess their perceptions regarding the level of stringency across markets and time for selected regulations. Perceptions were ranked on a likert scale and based on this scale a stringency index was constructed. The results show that Chile faces regulations which can be grouped into the following categories: (i) phytosanitary measures; (ii) tolerance limits for pesticide residues and contaminants; (iii) hygiene requirements; (iv) labeling, marking and packaging; (v) product and process standards; and (vi) registration procedures and other import requirements. The number of regulations varied among countries, ranging from 13 to 3 out of the 14 considered in the study. The most stringent country among the sample as perceived by exporters was Mexico, whereas the least stringent was Saudi Arabia. Additionally, exporters agreed that stringency has increased over time with an average of 15% between 2005 and 2009. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Data for the WTP model are sourced from a literature survey of the Agricola and Google Scholar databases yielding 46 studies estimating WTP for pure and impure (organic, grass-fed, natural) environmental meat attributes. Bayesian analysis is used to estimate 3 models varying in independent variables. Models are evaluated by the correlation coefficient (R-2), root mean squared error of prediction (RMSPE) and posterior model probability. The most probable model is then used to estimate a confidence range of WTP for pure environmental beef. Impure environmental labels result in higher WTP than pure labels. Non-hypothetical WTP for pure environmental labeling for North American consumers ranges from 6.7% to 32.6%. A case study is conducted to identify the expected reduction in water use that can be funded from capturing WTP through labeling. A multi-objective nutritional optimizer is used to identify ideal management of beef cattle to reduce whole-system water use in three regions of the United States. Cost increases from management are varied over the predicted range in WTP and combined with the probability of a consumer purchasing beef at each WTP value to identify the theoretical effect on expected environmental impact reduction. A 10% premium is the ideal WTP, resulting in water use reductions between 24.4 L and 41.4 L. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to explore the possibilities for future integrated dietary guidelines that support consumers to make informed dietary choices based on both ecological and nutritional values. We developed a score system for health and sustainability. Subsequently, we tested six different diets: current average Dutch, official 'recommended' Dutch, semi-vegetarian, vegetarian, vegan and Mediterranean. For the sustainability rating, we used the Life Cycle Assessment, measuring the impacts on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and land use (LU). For the health rating, we used ten nutritional indicators. By comparing the overall scores we found that the consumption of meat, dairy products, extras, such as snacks, sweets, pastries, and beverages, in that order, are largely responsible for low sustainability scores. Simultaneously, these food groups contribute to low health scores. We developed a matrix that illustrates that the health and sustainability scores of all six diets go largely hand in hand. Fig. I provides a visualisation of the position of the six diets in the full health and sustainability spectrum. This matrix with scores can be considered a first step in the development of a tool to measure both sustainability and health issues of specific food patterns. In selecting the diets, we examined two directions: health focus diets and the animal protein reduction diets. The Mediterranean diet is generally the health focus option with a high sustainability score. We conclude that guidelines oriented in between the two directions (i.e., semi- and pesco-vegetarian) are the option with the optimal synergy between health and sustainability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Global climate change is mainly transmitted through rising world food prices. Our simulation results suggest that climate change induced price increases for food will raise agricultural GDP while decreasing real household incomes and food security. Rural non-farm households are hit hardest as they tend to be net food consumers with high food budget shares, but farm households also experience real income losses given that many of them are net buyers of food. The impacts of local climate change are less clear given the ambiguous predictions of global climate models (GCMs) with respect to future rainfall patterns in Yemen. Local climate change impacts manifest itself in long term yield changes, which differ between two alternative climate scenarios considered. Under the MIR scenario, agricultural GDP is somewhat higher than with perfect mitigation and rural incomes rise due to higher yields and lower prices for sorghum and millet. Under the CSI scenario, positive and negative yield changes cancel each other out. As a result, agricultural GDP and household incomes hardly change compared to perfect mitigation.

However, the cultivation of soybeans using genetically modified (GM) varieties in non-EU countries is increasing and the EU authorization of GM products takes longer than in other countries, leading to an asynchronous approval between the EU and non-EU countries that might induce soybean trade disruptions. This paper uses an integrated modelling system to simulate Argentina, Brazil and the United States ending soybean exports to the EU. The impact on world trade and on the EU import prices of soy products is analysed with a computable general equilibrium model. EU soy imports are shown to decline, and the import price of soybeans in the EU increases. The effects on EU agricultural markets are analysed based on a partial equilibrium model. Feed costs in the EU are found to increase with poultry and pork the most affected: production and exports decline and imports increase. However, the effects of a trade ban are found to be less profound than in many other studies due to compensating substitution effects at various market levels: increasing imports from third countries, increasing domestic oilseed production and the use of other protein feeds.

We briefly review previous studies on the effectiveness of Farmer Early Retirement Schemes in promoting structural adjustment in agriculture and conclude that the economic case for these schemes seems weak. We then employ a dynamic farm optimisation model, incorporating a realistic specification of farmer decision-making, on an original Northern Irish dataset to analyse ex ante the possible impacts of New Entrant Schemes. We find a more positive potential impact from these schemes, particularly the option of an interest rate subsidy on farm development loans. This is attributed to the dynamic effects of the farm investments associated with such schemes, a likely reflection of the long-term effects of differences in age related lifecycle goals. Younger farmers have a longer planning horizon and tend to invest more heavily in business growth than comparable older age groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the current literature does not provide an accessible account of how governed markets are supposed to cope with the issues of animal welfare. This paper seeks to fill this gap by re-considering the political economy of animal welfare. Conceptual analysis shows that the major cause of market failure in the case of farm animal welfare is a problem of consumption externalities. It is the specific regulation of animal welfare conditions which is a public good (or bad). Two important conclusions follow from this analysis, which are largely unexplored in the literature on animal welfare. First, measurement of potential market failure, through identifying actual willingness to pay (WTP) for animal welfare friendly products, is potentially misleading. The difference between citizen votes and consumer WTP for animal welfare is not prima fade evidence for either market failure or a gap in the market. Second, conventional arguments in favour of subsidies and assistance to producers for better animal welfare are misconceived and potentially counterproductive. A more rational policy is to subsidise the consumption of animal welfare friendly products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant percentage of these farms produce commodities for the market. This productive dimension is often overlooked, however, as is the technical support needed by these farms. The privatization of national farm advisory systems (NFAS) has an impact on small-scale farming that should be better assessed. This paper, which looks at the characteristics of intangible services, helps demonstrate how the privatization of advisory services may have unexpected adverse effects on small farms. The dismantling of coordinating authorities has made these farms less visible as a target client. Less direct interaction with advisors makes it more difficult to co-produce knowledge that is relevant to their needs. In addition, back office activities such as scientific monitoring, building and updating databases and scientific experiments have been restructured in a way which does not support their interests.

The sequence of events that is modelled comprises a negative wheat supply shock and subsequent implementation of an export tax by a major net exporter and a reduction in import tariffs by a small importer. The effects of trade policy responses are contrasted with those of full liberalisation of the wheat market. At the core are the (opposite) effects on producers and consumers, as well as the terms of-trade and trade tax revenue effects. Food security is shown to depend crucially on changes in prices but also in incomes that are associated with changes in factor returns. The results reveal that major net exporters are generally better off when implementing export taxes for food security purposes. Large exporting countries export price instability causing world food prices to rise further. Net importing countries lose out and have limited leeway to reduce tariffs or subsidise imports. Liberalising wheat trade mitigates rising prices and contributes to food security, but to the detriment of production in Africa and Asia, making them more dependent on and vulnerable to changes in the world market. Concerted action at the WTO forum is required, notably clarifying and sharpening the rules regarding export measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This article presents the results of multiple inductive case studies of eight European countries to better understand the contingencies to animal welfare policy instruments and to further complement the framework of policy instruments available to policy makers. The qualitative evidence from this study is presented in the form of a policy decision tree indicating instruments likely to be effective under given conditions. The findings suggest that a one size fits all solution for animal welfare in the EU is unlikely to be effective and that although a market-based policy within the current EU context is in many cases inevitable, the barriers are numerous and require policy instruments tailored to the specific context.

The first hypothesis is that the paradigm shift has led to greater specialisation of production, so changing the ability and incentive for producers to supply certain foods relative to others. Second, the shift has affected farmgate prices (both up and down), so creating opportunities for the industries which purchase farm commodities (the food consuming industries - FCIs) to substitute lower priced ingredients, thereby influencing the nutritional quality and content of foods available in the marketplace. Third, it has increased the ability of the FCIs to add value through product innovation and marketing, creating a market characterised by highly differentiated products targeted to individualised preferences, thus increasing the acceptability of a wider variety and quantity of food products. The changing agricultural policy paradigm has therefore altered the environment in which consumers make their food choices, in the form of food availability, affordability and acceptability. Nevertheless, the paper finds no clear pattern when it comes to health; the changes have affected both unhealthy and healthy foods and ingredients. The key process of importance for health, then, is not whether the ingredients produced by agriculture are healthy or not, but how they are substituted, transformed, distributed and marketed through the supply chain (e.g. vegetable oils into transfats). This leads to an important implication: that policies to intervene directly in agricultural production to promote healthy eating are unlikely to be effective or efficient if they do not take into account how foods are processed, distributed and marketed through the supply chain. In practice, this means that the potential for policy interventions in agriculture to improve diets is limited - but nevertheless potentially important where it exists given the upstream nature of the change. Incentives could be created for the FCIs to substitute healthier ingredients in their products, and/or to sell more of them, in instances where these changes can be passed all the way to the consumer. Greater investment could also be made in fruit and vegetable production for local markets. Along with testing the hypotheses established in this paper, the research priority should to identify the incentives that influence the products produced by the FCIs, with the objective of finding those most amenable to leveraging the supply chain towards healthier eating.

Consequently, we designed a survey instrument to better understand consumer reaction to food recalls, and in particular, uncover the driving influences behind these broad consumption changes. Results were analyzed using hierarchical regression analysis. We find that recall concern, propensity to reduce consumption beyond the recall parameters in the situation of both specific branded and unbranded products, and media reliance hold strong, direct effects on broad consumption changes. Further, recall awareness exhibited a minimal role as a moderating influence, but held a strong, direct relationship with the broad consumption changes dependent measure. In addition, using chi-square tests of differences, we find two distinct points of divergence between Millennials and Non-Millennials. First, Millennials have much lower recall awareness. Secondly, Millennials are more likely to react in ways unwarranted by the recall than older generations for the peanut butter recall scenario. These findings are extremely important as policymakers, commodity processors, food manufacturers, and food retailers develop strategies for minimizing the negative impacts from food recalls.

This study synthesizes how people, markets and governments are responding to rising land pressures in Africa, drawing on key findings from the various contributions in this special issue. The papers herein revisit the issue of Boserupian agricultural intensification as an important response to land constraints, but they also go further than Boserup and her followers to explore broader responses to land constraints, including non-farm diversification, migration, and reduced fertility rates. Agricultural and rural development strategies in the region will need to more fully anticipate the implications of Africa's rapidly changing land and demographic situation, and the immense challenges that mounting land pressures pose in the context of current evidence of unsustainable agricultural intensification, a rapidly rising labor force associated with the region's current demographic conditions, and limited nonfarm job creation. These challenges are manageable but will require explicit policy actions to address the unique development challenges in densely populated rural areas. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The concept of frames refers to relatively distinct and coherent sets of meaning attributed to a concept, such as food security. The article shows that in the European Union (EU) food security is a consensus frame which can be broken down in six conflicting and overlapping sub-frames and which has complicated the debates about the future of the CAP. We demonstrate that during the CAP-reform debates of 2009-2012 a variety of food security arguments were deployed by a broad range of stakeholders, who attached different meanings and made different claims about the relationship between the CAP and food security. Inductive frame analysis reveals that the consensus frame of food security can be broken down into six conflicting and overlapping sub-frames: (1) the productionist frame, (2) the environmental frame, (3) the development frame, (4) the free trade frame, (5) the regional frame, and (6) the food sovereignty frame. Each of these frames was invoked by a specific group of stakeholders, whereby the productionist and environmental frames were deployed most often. The European Commission, meanwhile, invoked various frames at the same time in its communications. As a result of these various framings of the relationship between the CAP and food security, a clear political vision on this relationship is lacking. We conclude that politicians and policymakers may need to develop a coherent vision on what food security entails, and on how the CAP could contribute to both European and global food security.

They include all of the known vitamins and essential trace minerals. Micronutrient malnutrition affects 1/3-1/2 of the global population. It causes untold human suffering and levies huge costs on society in terms of unrealized human potential and lost economic productivity. The goal of this paper is to identify deficiencies in the food system that lead to micronutrient malnutrition and explore and evaluate strategies for its prevention. We examine the impact of agricultural practices on micronutrients in the food supply, including cropping systems, soil fertility and animal agriculture. We then discuss the potential of biofortification - i.e. increasing the concentration of micronutrients in staple food crops through conventional plant breeding or genetic engineering- as means to reduce micronutrient deficiency. In addition, we discuss the impact of food losses and food waste on micronutrients in the food supply, and we explore successful strategies to preserve micronutrients from farm to plate, including food fortification. Our review of the literature sheds light on the advantages and limitations of alternative interventions to reduce micronutrient deficiencies along the supply chain. We end with recommendations for actions that will reduce the prevalence of micronutrient malnutrition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We find modest within-community targeting outcomes, but weak between-community targeting. This appears to be because, controlling for the direct influence of household characteristics, participation was lower in poorer communities. These inter-community differentials are strongly correlated with several proxies for citizen voice, including education, income, and access to other public services.

A total of 40 empirical studies, which yielded 99 estimated elasticities were considered. The results indicate the presence of publication bias in the reported elasticities. Besides, the estimates revealed evidence of positive and significant empirical effect of income on calorie intake from all the studies that goes beyond publication bias. Study attributes such as ranking of the journal, panel data used in the analysis, whether expenditure was used as proxy for income, year of primary survey, sample size, and numbers of the years of primary data were found to have statistically significant impacts on the reported calorie-income elasticities in the literature.

An alternative vision defended by the food sovereignty movement is that long-term food security cannot rely on dependency on food imports, but must be built on the development of domestic production with enough barrier protection to shelter it from world price fluctuations and unfair trading. The purpose of this paper is to look into whether the West African nations can achieve food sovereignty given their various trade commitments and other external constraints. The particularity of our approach is to combine a historical economic analysis with a political approach to food sovereignty and trade commitments. Our results suggest that external brakes on the development of food sovereignty policies are marginal, as the countries still have unused room for manoeuvre to protect their smallholder agriculture under the terms of draft World Trade Organization agreements and Economic Partnership Agreements and under the international financial institutions' recommendations. Rather the international environment seems to be instrumented by West African states that do not manage to secure a national political consensus to drive structural reforms deemed vital and further the food security of the urban populations over the marginalized rural populations. Recently, the regional integration process has made headway with a common agricultural support and protection policy project that could herald an internal political balance more conducive to food-producing agriculture.

We carried out a choice experiment to investigate preferences and estimate Willingness to Pay of Scotch malt whisky consumers for pesticide use restrictions and the potential impact on the production of one of its essential ingredients, barley. Using latent class models, we find that about half of the respondents are non-demanders with respect to both attributes, and only a third of the sample population are willing to pay for further pesticide restrictions. Demand for more environmentally responsible production of Scotch malt whisky is therefore limited, indicating that in the case of Scotch malt whisky, consumers are not likely to be key to driving sustainable production. With respect to barley provenance, being able to claim a 100% Scottish product could be a plausible commercial option for some producers to pursue in a competitive market. Methodologically, the scale-adjusted latent class model proved to be successful in uncovering preference heterogeneity and its sources, in including non-demanders in the analysis and in accounting for differences in scale amongst respondents.

The three types of farms differ by certification to international production standards as well as by size. A multidimensional approach measures welfare using human capital, income, physical and mental health, and life satisfaction. The findings suggest that GlobalGAP certification has a positive impact on worker welfare as farm workers are given more training. Workers on large certified farms earn more than those on small farms but also show more health problems. Certification on small farms is associated with higher satisfaction of workers with their life compared to workers on non-certified small farms.

Now would be a good time to eliminate remaining distortions and put in place more efficient alternatives, including social safety nets and tools to help farmers manage risk. This would lock in the benefits of reform and simultaneously address charges of policy incoherence. In the context of high food prices, new issues have emerged with potential implications for food security. They include export restrictions, the use of biofuel mandates, and the opportunities and threats presented by increased foreign investment in agriculture. On these issues, as well as in terms of conventional support mechanisms, policies in emerging economies (in particular the BRIICS) are increasingly important. A pro-active agenda for policy coherence would involve not just eliminating policies that distort trade, but also enacting positive measures to increase food availability, for example by raising agricultural productivity, using resources sustainably, and eliminating waste and over-consumption. Across countries, there are important gains to be realised from knowledge sharing, and from multilateral action to provide global public goods - not least smoother functioning of the multilateral trading system.

Using survey data for 474 farmers in four commodity sectors, gherkins, papaya marigold and broiler, an endogenous switching model is used to estimate net profits from participation. Findings suggest that average treatments effect vary widely across contract commodities. Papaya and broiler contracting offer clear net gains for participants whereas marigold contracting leaves participants worse off. For gherkins, while contracting holds net gains for participating farmers overall, this is true of contracts with some firms but not others. The standard deviations of point estimates of treatment effects are quite large indicating variability in profit gains even within the same commodity sectors. Thus, notwithstanding the sign of average treatment effects, contract farming arrangements have diverse impacts on income for individual farmers and these could have implications for sustained participation of farmers in high value agriculture.

This study investigates the impact of income diversification on incomes of fishing communities living on the Kenyan shores of Lake Victoria. Using four propensity score matching methods, we find evidence that income diversification increases the incomes of fish workers. The strongest impact appears to be among fishers, fish enterprise employees and fish workers in the non-export beach.

In particular, as the experimental design allows us to investigate the validity of elicited risk measures, we examine the magnitude of differences between valid and invalid observations. In addition, using an econometric model, we also explore the effect of consumers' socioeconomic status and attitudes toward food safety on subjects' perceptions of pesticide residues in apples. Results suggest first, that consumers do not expect an increase in the number of apples containing only one pesticide residue, but, rather, in the number of those apples with traces of multiple residues. Second, we find that valid subjective risk measures do not significantly diverge from invalid ones, indicative of little effect of internal validity on the actual magnitude of subjective risks. Finally, we show that subjective risks depend on age, education, a subject's ties to the apple industry, and consumer association membership. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

First it questions the validity of an overarching 'metanarrative' approach to development. Then it discusses the different types of knowledge, values and method and draws attention to the increasingly heterogeneous development policy context and also the heterogeneity among the smallholder 'targets' of agrifood policies. Second, a case study exemplifies this critique in the context of an existing multistakeholder strategy of commercialising the Zambian cassava sector. Although limited in scope, the primary research illustrates how a commercial supply response should not be assumed from within a rural sector more concerned with food security. The study casts doubt on the validity of a commercialising metanarrative. Rather, it endorses the need for a multidisciplinary understanding of the particular and local context which influences knowledge generation and development design, accounting for different value systems and perceptions of reality and,smallholder farmer decision making within heterogeneous contexts.

We compiled estimates of the amount and value of food loss for more than 200 individual foods in the United States using the US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service's Loss-Adjusted Food Availability data and then aggregated these values to estimate the total value of food loss and the value by food group. The results indicate that in 2008, the estimated total value of food loss at the retail and consumer levels in the United States as purchased at retail prices was $165.6 billion. The top three food groups in terms of the value of food loss at these levels are: meat, poultry, and fish (41%); vegetables (17%); and dairy products (14%). Looking more closely at the estimates for the consumer level, this level of loss translates into almost 124 kg (273 lb) of food lost from human consumption, per capita, in 2008 at an estimated retail price of $390/capita/year. Food loss represents a significant share of household food expenditures: our estimates suggest that the annual value of food loss is almost 10% of the average amount spent on food per consumer in 2008 and over 1% of the average disposable income. This consumer level loss translates into over.3 kg (0.7 lb) of food per capita per day valued at $1.07/day. Our estimates of the total value of food loss in the United States and loss estimates by food group are useful in that they can generate awareness of the issue among the food industry members, governments, and consumers. Potential large-scale approaches and economic incentives to mitigate food loss in developed countries are also discussed.

A regional specialisation of primary agricultural production is especially apparent in meat production. Thus, the German-Dutch border area has developed into a region of unprecedented intensive pork production. While The Netherlands specialises in piglet production, the production of fattened pigs continues to grow in northwest Germany. As a result of this increasing transnational value chain development, German imports of Dutch piglets have risen continuously since 2000. However, this structural interweaving of pork production between The Netherlands and Germany has resulted in many new challenges for the cooperation between the various participants and in particular for the administrative authorities in the field of food and feed safety as well as efficient animal disease control. The motivation for this exploratory study stems from the lack of scientific work on this topic to date. The aim of this research is to illustrate the relevance of functioning cross-border cooperation in the food sector, using commodity flow structures and disease spread analysis. Results indicate that cross-border cooperation between authorities during a CSF epidemic can reduce the risk of recurrence and the duration by 50%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Certified organic production and marketing was examined as a potential strategy to improve chemical food safety. A stratified random sampling strategy was applied to study the preferences of food vendors (n = 180) and consumers (n = 360); vegetable use, risk perception, choice preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for organic certification were specifically analyzed. The results showed that awareness of chemical contamination risks was generally low. Appearance of a product was central to vendor choice; consumers attributed similar utility to taste and organic certification. Consumer WTP was calculated to be a premium of 1.04 USD (per plate) if the food served contained only certified organic vegetables. In restaurants, this would mean an average premium of 19% for a meal. If certified organic vegetable production is to make a positive impact on food safety in urban West Africa, we suggest concentrating marketing efforts on the educated elite who frequent restaurants. However, considering that restaurant owners exhibited a lower preference for organic certification than lower class food vendors, the marketing situation is difficult. We therefore conclude that demand from the food vending sector alone will not institutionalize domestic certification mechanisms; this underlines the need for public commitment to facilitating such change.

We show that while differences in consumer perceptions about COOL information, namely, whether it is viewed as an attribute that differentiates products vertically or horizontally, do not alter the nature of the market and consumer welfare effects of mandatory COOL, the relative strength of consumer preferences for COOL are shown to be important in determining the magnitude of these effects. In addition, our results show that the benchmark used (a no COOL versus a voluntary COOL regime) is critical in evaluating the effects of the policy. We show that, under both horizontal and vertical product differentiation, a change from a no COOL to a mandatory COOL regime decreases (increases) the welfare of consumers with weak (strong) preference for COOL while a change from a voluntary to a mandatory COOL regime leads to an unambiguous loss in consumer welfare.

We study spatial price transmission between SA maize markets where trade is dominated by informal product flows. This provides an opportunity to study private sector market performance in a largely unregulated market environment. Contrary to some existing evidence on the performance of SA grain markets connected by formal trade, we find that informally trading markets work quite well. Long-run price equilibrium is consistent with competitive trade, price transmission is rapid, and potential trade constraints have no disruptive impact on long-run relationships. Nevertheless, we do find evidence of occasionally high transfer costs that may impede informal trade flows. The conclusion is that a policy focus on encouraging informal trade and lowering informal trade costs would lead to improved market performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the race between these two countervailing forces, with the goal of inform two important policy questions. First, how do rural Ethiopians adapt to land constraints? And second, do land constraints significantly influence welfare outcomes in rural Ethiopia? To answer these questions we use a recent household survey of high-potential areas. We first show that farm sizes are generally very small in the Ethiopian highlands and declining over time, with young rural households facing particularly severe land constraints. We then ask whether smaller and declining farm sizes are inducing agricultural intensification, and if so, how. We find strong evidence in favor of the Boserupian hypothesis that land-constrained villages typically use significantly more purchased input costs per hectare and more family labor, and achieve higher maize and teff yields and higher gross income per hectare. However, although these higher inputs raise gross revenue, we find no substantial impact of greater land constraints on net farm income per hectare once family labor costs are accounted for. Moreover, farm sizes are strongly positively correlated with net farm income, suggesting that land constraints are an important cause of rural poverty. We conclude with some broad policy implications of our results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we look at the case of Ghana to identify whether fast population growth and the remarkable agricultural performance the country has enjoyed in recent years have resulted in favorable conditions for the adoption of Asian-style Green Revolution technologies. Through descriptive analysis combined with empirical assessment of the economic efficiency of agriculture in different production systems and agroecologies we are able assess the relevance of Green Revolution technologies for agricultural production in Ghana. In particular, we analyze whether fertilizer use in Ghana is associated with high population density and intensive cereal production and whether land-intensive innovations are associated with more efficient production practices. Overall, we do not find evidence of Asian-style Green Revolution agricultural intensification in Ghana; in fact, we find no correlation between population density and input intensity. We also find that labor costs still play a major role in Ghanaian agricultural development in limiting the adoption of labor-intensive technologies even in relatively high population density areas.

Adoption of healthy diets is suggested to be an option for less environmentally intensive food habits and improved public health. In particular, changes in meat consumption are believed to bring potential benefits. Objective: To quantify the impact of changes in meat consumption on the dietary contribution of nutrients, GHG emissions and on land requirement. Design: Scenario analysis is performed for three scenarios representing different variants of meat consumption in Sweden. The reference scenario is based on average Swedish meat consumption while NUTR-1 and NUTR-2 are hypothetical scenarios in line with prevailing dietary guidelines. The results are evaluated in relation to the recommended daily intake of nutrients, international climate goals and global capacity for sustainable expansion of agricultural land. Uncertainties and variations in data are captured by using Monte Carlo simulation. Results: Meat consumption in line with nutritional guidelines, implying an approximate 25% reduction of Swedish average intake, reduces the contribution of total and saturated fat by 59-76%, energy, iron and zinc by about half and protein by one quarter. Restrictions in meat consumption are most critical for the intake of iron and zinc, whereas positive effects on public health are expected due to the reduced intake of saturated fat. Aligning meat consumption with dietary guidelines reduces GHG emissions from meat production from 40% to approximately 15-25% of the long-term (2050) per capita budget of sustainable GHG emissions and the share of per capita available cropland from 50% to 20-30%.

This paper examines whether prices in urban consumer markets within developing countries are co-integrated with prices in world agricultural commodity markets. Using a single equation error correction model, we examine the response of consumer prices for wheat, rice, maize, and sorghum to changes in world market prices and exchange rates in urban centers of the developing world. Analyzing over 60 country/commodity pairings, we find that developing countries' consumer markets are co-integrated with world markets. Yet, we also find that the transmission of changes in both world prices and real exchange rates to domestic consumer prices is not high, and that the movement of domestic consumer prices to new equilibrium with world prices after a shock to the latter is relatively slow.

Farmers have to store maize to bridge seasons, for food security and to protect against price fluctuations. However, the traditional storage methods do not protect grain well, resulting in large postharvest losses. Hermetically sealed metal silos kill storage pests by oxygen deprivation without pesticides. Popular in Central America, they are now being promoted in Africa, but their impact here has not yet been studied. This study used propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of metal silos on duration of maize storage, loss abatement, cost of storage, and household food security. Metal silo adopters (N = 116) were matched with non-adopting farmers from a representative sample of 1340 households covering the major maize-growing zones in Kenya. The major effect of the metal silos was an almost complete elimination of losses due to insect pests, saving farmers an average of 150-200 kg of grain, worth KSh9750 (US$130). Metal silo adopters also spent about KSh340 less on storage insecticides. Adopters were able to store their maize for 1.8-2.4 months longer, and to sell their surplus after five months at good prices, instead of having to sell right after the harvest. The period of inadequate food provision among adopters was reduced by more than one month. We conclude that metal silos are effective in reducing grain losses due to maize-storage insects, and that they have a large impact on the welfare and food security of farm households. The initial cost of metal silos is high (KSh20,000/1.8 ton) and therefore policies to increase access to credit, to reduce the cost of sheet metal, and to promote collective action can improve their uptake by smallholder farmers.

Since 2004, annual announcements have trumpeted rises in subsidies. Despite the historic turnaround of policy and likely implication of this subsidy policy to China's food economy, there has been little household level survey-based research that has sought to understand the nature of China's subsidy programs from the viewpoint of the farmer. Using data from two sets of household-based surveys (covering tens of thousands of households and most major producing provinces) and survey data from government, in this paper we examine the subsidies that are directly given to farmers, one of the newest and relatively high profiles components of China's subsidy programs. We focus on China's grain, input, seed, and machinery subsidy programs. According to the survey-based findings, we show that although agricultural subsidies per farm are low, on a per hectare basis the rate of subsidies is high. Almost all producers are receiving them. Subsidies are mostly being given to the land contractor, not the tiller. Most of grain, input and seed subsidies are non-distorting, but machinery subsidy is based on farmers' actual purchase of machineries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Vaccination can be used as a strategy to prevent the outbreak of animal epidemics. The current study examines people's willingness to eat meat from animals vaccinated against an animal epidemic. We asked people separately about their willingness to eat meat from animals vaccinated against both animal epidemics and against zoonoses. Zoonoses are also animal epidemics, but they might affect human health. A questionnaire was sent out to a representative sample of Swiss people and yielded N = 1033 completed datasets. Although animal vaccinations were highly accepted among those surveyed, compared to a wide range of other animal applications such as antibiotics, only about a quarter of those surveyed indicated that they would eat meat from animals vaccinated against a zoonosis. Some 60% indicated they would eat meat from animals vaccinated against an animal epidemic. We found attitudes about animal vaccination, knowledge about human vaccination, misunderstanding of animal treatments, and average meat consumption to significantly influence people's willingness to eat meat from animals vaccinated against a zoonosis. Therefore, it is necessary that regulatory bodies provide information on both the safety of meat for human consumption and ways to minimize any potential health risks from the handling or consumption of meat products that might be infected in cases of zoonotic outbreaks.

Insights from Cameroon,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Policy instruments; NTFP; Farmers' perception; Tree planting; Indigenous fruit trees; Cameroon,AGROFORESTRY ADOPTION; DETERMINANTS; CONSERVATION; BEHAVIOR; POLICIES; ZONE,"From theory it is expected that forestry laws and regulations affect the adoption of agroforestry technologies, such as planting of indigenous fruit trees. These trees are important sources of nutrients and income to thousands of farmers. However data on farmers' perceptions and behaviour towards such policy instruments are scarce and contradictory. Based on data collected from 394 households in Cameroon, using a structured questionnaire, farmers' awareness, perception and willingness to accept policy instruments governing on-farm trees were assessed. The study further investigated whether the policy instruments would affect their intentions to plant selected indigenous fruit trees on their farms. The analysis found that a majority of farmers are unaware of the laws governing access and trade in indigenous fruit tree species. Furthermore, even if strictly applied, a significant majority of farmers (60%) would not be discouraged by the regulations, from planting trees on their farms because it constitutes part of their traditional farming practices. Yet, the authors argue that planting of indigenous fruit tree species could increase under simplified rules, as 40% of the farmers do claim they would refuse to plant such trees if existing regulations are strictly enforced. The study therefore concludes that there is a need for new policies to attract more farmers to integrate indigenous fruit trees on their farms. Given the current trend to encourage on-farm tree planting to address food security and climate change issues, this is especially relevant. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past decade, numerous innovations have enhanced the prevention and treatment of many forms of malnutrition; these include wider adoption of new food products, protocols for their use, and programming guidelines. The quality and scale of interventions has improved despite many challenges, resulting in fewer avoidable deaths and growing success in the management of severe and moderate wasting, as well as micronutrient deficiencies. Indeed, many lessons learned in emergencies have the potential to inform non-emergency programming. As such, there is a need for more explicit attention to emergency needs and activities in global target-setting developmental agendas. However, as caseloads and costs continue to grow, there are calls for more evidence-based guidance on the best combination of approaches to use in different contexts. Best practice is still constrained by evidence gaps, due in large part to the difficulties of research in humanitarian contexts. Nevertheless, sound empirical research must be prioritized on the efficacy, effectiveness and costs of various single and combined approaches. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, some biotech crops can be cultivated in one or more countries but may not be approved for use in others. Under such circumstances, small amounts of unapproved biotech crops can be found in the food/feed supplies of some countries and under zero threshold policies they must be withdrawn and can lead to market disruptions. In this paper we examine the potential economic implications of regulatory asynchronicity and zero threshold policies for unapproved GMOs using the EU as a case study. To measure the potential economic impacts from possible trade disruptions between the EU and its major suppliers of soybeans, we develop a spatial equilibrium model and examine alternative scenarios where bilateral trade flows are set to zero. From our analysis we find that when asynchronous approvals become a systemic problem leading to trade disruptions with multiple trading partners the impacts can be severe. For instance, we find that if the EU were to stop imports from its three main suppliers the US, Brazil and Argentina, it would pay roughly 220% more for soybeans, 211% more for soybean meal and 202% more for soy oil.

This paper argues for the need for such an index and outlines one way of constructing it. We use secondary data to construct the Hunger Reduction Commitment Index (HRCI) for 21 developing countries. We operationalise commitment around 3 themes: legal frameworks, policies and programmes and government expenditures, to find Malawi, the Gambia, Guatemala, Brazil and Senegal heading the list, with China, Nepal, Lesotho, Zambia and Guinea Bissau coming bottom. Rankings were robust to our choices about weighting and ranking methods. The paper demonstrates a viable method to measure political commitment and highlights the analytical importance of disentangling hunger commitment from hunger outcomes. Cross-tabulations of HRCI scores with hunger, wealth, administrative capacity and voice and accountability scores can guide action from different stakeholders (governments, civil society, donors). Finally, we show how primary data collection might be used to assess areas of strength and weakness in country specific commitments to reduce hunger. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These exports increasingly have to comply with stringent public and private standards, as well as other quality and safety issues. There is an ongoing debate on the effect of private standards on the inclusion of small-scale farmers in export supply chains. With this paper, we contribute to this debate by providing new evidence from the Peruvian asparagus export sector, and by addressing several important methodological shortcomings and gaps in the existing literature. We describe export dynamics using a unique firm level dataset on 567 asparagus export firms from 1993 to 2011 and the evolution of certification to private standards using own survey data from a stratified random sample of 87 export firms. We use an unbalanced panel of the surveyed companies on 19 years and several methods, including fixed effects and GMM estimators, to estimate the causal impact of certification to private standards on companies' sourcing strategy. We find that certification leads to vertical integration and significantly reduces the share of produce that is sourced from external producers, with a larger effect for small-scale producers. When distinguishing between production and processing standards, and between low-level and high-level standards, we find that especially high-level production standards have a negative impact on sourcing from (small-scale) producers.

Using an adult, non-student subject pool of 271 participants in an economic experiment, consumers' response to different types of fruit and vegetable advertising is measured empirically. This study finds that broad-based advertising, which is generic advertising for the entire fruit and vegetable category, increases consumer willingness to pay by an average of 24.6%. The simulation model shows that broad-based advertising for fruits and vegetables, either alone or as a hybrid with individual commodity-specific campaigns (e.g., apple advertising), would reduce average caloric intake per person by approximately 1800 kcal per year. The results of this study may contribute to new public policy initiatives that aim to reduce diet-related illnesses and obesity, which have become increasingly prevalent in the United States.

An overview of EFSA's Public Consultation instrument,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,EFSA; Open consultations; Stakeholders' involvement,GOVERNANCE; PARTICIPATION; SCIENCE; FRAMEWORK; EXERCISES; EUROPE; RISK,"Following the BSE crisis, the importance of reassuring European consumers and involving them in debate about food safety management issues is generally recognised. Indeed, consulting stakeholders is one of the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) main duties, as stated in its founding regulation (art. 42, whereas 56), where EFSA must have effective contacts with consumer representatives, producer representatives, processors and any other interested parties. Even if not clearly obliged to, EFSA has also opted to consider lay citizens' opinion (under an interpretation of art. 42, wh. 40 of the 178 Reg.) in order to enhance trust in food safety. Beyond having formally established meetings with restricted access for participants - like the Stakeholders' Consultative Platform and the Annual Colloquium, - EFSA engages in its Public Consultation web-based Window (PCW). It allows listening to anybody who wishes to submit comments on technical issues. An intriguing question is whether this constitutes a step towards direct democracy on food safety issues; under which assumptions EFSA adopted this tool; and under which (internal and external) pressures it updated its functioning in 2008. Using evaluation criteria from the academic literature, we assess the qualities of this mechanism. We conclude that the mechanism does have some merits, even though - as stated by Douglas (1982)  ... creating practical participatory mechanisms for the public is increasingly difficult in a decision-making environment heavily dominated by technical expertise.

Indeed the global food system has several merits for nations, businesses and individual consumers well-being. However, as increasing evidence suggests that we are approaching an era of climate change and scarcity of cheap energy sources the sustainability of that system must be examined. One part of any food commodity chain is its 'food miles' - the distance the commodity travels from point of production to point of consumption, the required energy and resulting emissions. This paper presents a 1 year 'snapshot' of Canada's total import related food miles. It presents an analysis of the distance imported foods traveled from around the world to major points of consumption in Canada and documents the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions related to those imports. It presents both a macro scale picture of the equivalent emissions related to transportation of imported food and a micro scale picture which focuses on specific commodities consumed in various parts of the country. It then discusses policy implications for food sustainability. Overall the research highlights that about 30% of the agricultural and food commodities consumed in Canada are imported, resulting in 'food miles' of over 61 billion tonnes km, leading to annual emissions of 3.3 million metric tonnes of CO2. Of the various agriculture and food commodities studied, fruits and vegetables had the highest food miles related ;emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

One important instrument to meet this increasing demand and to decrease the pressure on food production is to minimize food losses and food waste. Food waste and loss is a major societal, economic, nutritional and environmental challenge. Using the case of Denmark, this paper analyses causes of food waste, and discusses how different stakeholders address the prevention and reuse of the (sic)1.18 billion of annual edible food waste. Currently, the majority of food waste is still incinerated with energy recovery. However, improvements in technology have made it more efficient to utilize food waste for biogas and compost, which improves nutrient cycling through the food system. Major efforts to address food waste in Denmark have mainly been promoted through civil society groups with governmental support, as well as by industry. In order to better understand food waste and loss more research must be conducted on the total amount of food waste at every level of the food supply chain. Solutions can be found through improved communication, more efficient food packaging, and better in interpretation of food labels by consumers. Likewise, systems thinking may support an integrated agricultural and food system where food utilization is optimized and loss and waste of resources is reduced. In conclusion, sustainable solutions to the reduction of food waste in Denmark must include multi-stakeholders collaboration, especially public private partnerships at the global level.

Worldwide production of aquatic resources has grown rapidly in the past few decades, and aquaculture production in Asia has played a decisive role in this growth. We examine the main forms of coordination found along these value chains and the role that institutional frameworks play in governing them. We observe that negative publicity, driven by NGO and media campaigns, has led to increased use of third-party certification and the adoption of public and private standards. We find that the most sophisticated aquaculture operations in Asia are found in value chains led by retailers and branded processors and where the quality of domestic institutional frameworks has facilitated compliance with increasing demands from buyers overseas. Finally, we reflect on the sustainability challenges of aquaculture and provide four broad observations on the governance of food value chains. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These claims emerged as the result of a legal dispute about commercial speech rights on dietary supplements and food products. The initial court ruling allowed manufacturers to include diet-disease information on packaging, when supporting evidence does not meet the traditional threshold of Significant Scientific Agreement. QHCs communicate about a potential health benefit of the consumption of a food or supplement, and due to their nature, are required to specify the balance of evidence behind the diet-disease relationships. As a result, the language contained in QHCs is complex, making them difficult for consumers to understand. The language has been further complicated by a continuing series of court challenges about how scientific evidence is described in QHCs. To understand the evolution of QHC language, we review the progression of court rulings surrounding qualified health claims and subsequent regulations by the FDA.

Measures of food security are urgently required for purposes of early warning, assessment of current and prospective status of at-risk populations, and monitoring and evaluation of specific programs and policies. Different measures are often used interchangeably, without a good idea of which dimensions of food security are captured by which measures, resulting in potentially significant misclassification of food insecure populations. The objective of this paper is to compare how the most frequently used indicators of food security portray static and dynamic food security among the same sample of rural households in two districts of Tigray State, Northern Ethiopia. Seven food security indicators were assessed: the Coping Strategies Index (CSI); the Reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI); the Household Food Insecurity and Access Scale (HFIAS); the Household Hunger Scale (HHS); Food Consumption Score (FCS); the Household Dietary Diversity Scale (HDDS); and a self-assessed measure of food security (SAFS). These indicators provide very different estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity, but are moderately well correlated and depict generally similar food security trends over time. We suggest that the differences in prevalence estimates, and in some cases the weaker than expected correlation, can be explained in three ways. First, the indicators differ in the underlying aspect of food security they attempt to capture. Second, each indicator is likely only sensitive within a certain severity range of food insecurity and these ranges do not always overlap. Third, categorization of the prevalence of food insecurity is strongly dependent on the choice of cut-off points. For valid reasons, food insecurity has no accepted gold standard metric against which individual indicators can be gauged, though without one it is difficult to say which indicator performs best in correctly and reliably identifying food insecure households. The implication is that using more than one indicator is advisable, and policy makers should be aware of what elements Of food insecurity each indicator portrays. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Employing a parametric stochastic distance frontier framework we find that IFQs improved the TE of the vertical line and bottom longline fleets. Our results suggest that the observed TE gains were mainly driven by the retirement of less efficient vessels and, to a lesser extent, by efficiency gains of the remaining vessels. We also document changes in output and input distance elasticities and in returns to scale following the introduction of IFQs.

These steps are: (i) development of a fish sector model for each country, (ii) construction of ex ante impact indicators of improved carp strains, and (iii) analysis of the overall potential impact of culturing the genetically improved carp strains by incorporating the technology scenarios into the fish sector model. The results show that the genetic improvement programs of carp strains are highly beneficial to fish farmers, fish consumers and national economies in Asia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared the food security status of households affected by HIV/AIDS to households not affected by HIV/AIDS. We also identified coping strategies adopted by members of food insecure households. 315 Households were included in the study, consisting of 169 HIV affected households, (44 households with self-identified HIV positive adults, 80 households with orphans, and 45 households with both orphans and self-identified HIV positive adults). These households were compared to 146 HIV unaffected households. Food security status was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Indicator (HFIAS) guide. Coping strategies were measured using the Coping Strategies Index (CSI). HIV affected households had a significantly higher food insecurity score 11.11, compared to 9.53 in HIV unaffected households (p = 0.037). Female headed households had the worst food security, regardless of household type. There were also significant difference in the coping strategies scores between HIV affected (64.48) and unaffected households (50.31) (p = 0.004). HIV affected households were associated with more severe coping strategies. The food security of HIV affected households is compromised by a variety of factors including the synergy generated by hosting a HIV positive family member and orphans. The gender of the household head is also an important consideration. Households headed by women tend to be more vulnerable, predisposing households to greater food insecurity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a broad range of studies has examined consumers' attention, perception and use of nutrition tables, relatively little is known about what types of consumers use what kind of nutrition information. Therefore, using data from the Swiss Food Panel, we conducted a cluster analysis of nutrition information usage and health and nutrition interest to determine whether consumers could be segmented into specific groups. We identified four segments, which we labelled Official Information Users, Internet Users, Moderate Users and Uninterested. We then determined the segments' demographics, food frequencies and perception of food. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions for targeted interventions that stimulate healthy food choices among these four segments. Our findings imply that nutrition education or the improvement of nutrition labels is unlikely tostimulate nutrition information usage among all consumer types; some consumers may rather benefit more from environmental cues that prime healthy food choices.

Applying a marketing approach to non-commercial policy objectives such as healthy eating, termed social marketing, is an emerging but as yet underdeveloped field. An earlier study conducted a case analysis of recent successful commercial food marketing and identified key success factors that may be further transferred to the public sector. Six of these factors (trend awareness, endorsement, emotion, common value, media coverage, and 'why and how') were presented to and discussed by 31 experts in a two-round Delphi survey. The objective was to determine to what extent these factors are used in public information and social marketing campaigns for healthier eating, and what is required to successfully transfer those factors into the public arena. The analysis shows that 'classic' information campaigns prevail. In considering which factors to explore, emphasis is given to low-cost factors, trust building, and the potential to lead to long-term behaviour change. Close cooperation with stakeholders, targeted approaches with a fitting combination of factors, and a consistent message are highlighted. Important target group differences regarding the application of the success factors are age, life-cycle stage, education, and level of healthy eating involvement. It is argued that policy makers possess the data to help prepare targeted approaches and that they enjoy good credibility, but lack the know how to exploit the data and understand the target groups. Weaknesses are also seen in a lack of coordination and effective decision-making structures, as well as a lack of accountability among policy makers. A number of themes were repeatedly mentioned as being important, including the need for evaluating effectiveness, the issue of funding, and improved stakeholder cooperation and knowledge exchange. It is concluded that, depending on the objective and target group in question, all factors are deemed relevant to consider, but low cost techniques can be an especially favourable addition. Effectiveness measurements ought to be established to determine the added value of new and different approaches. Of crucial importance for long-term success is building trust in public policy institutions and activities, cooperative efforts and consistency, and coupling public information and social marketing campaigns with structural changes.

We elicit these perceptions of relative responsibility via surveys using the best-worst scaling technique and analyse the data via Bayesian estimation of mixed logit models. Results are reported for two groups of stakeholders: consumers and farmers, and for two meat food chains: chicken and beef. The results reveal that consumers tend to think farmers are more responsible for ensuring meat safety than farmers do. Similarly, farmers tend to think consumers have a greater degree of responsibility than consumers believe they have themselves. Such beliefs might affect stakeholders' willingness to take actions and reduce hazards in the supply chain. From a policy perspective, the research findings provide useful insights to support policymakers and other decision-makers in the industry in developing mitigation strategies. Communication with consumers and farmers about emerging food safety problems in a supply chain and their involvement in proactive practices would need to be attuned to their subjective perceptions of relative responsibilities in order for integrated risk management systems to be effective.

The news media has long been both a primary source of consumer information relating to food safety and a notable contributor to the policy agenda. A content analysis of 160 articles from four national US newspapers, the largest regional paper in Iowa, and the Associated Press revealed that the recall was framed both as a failure of government oversight and as an instance of poor production practices by the farmers in question. Proposed responses to the recall similarly fell into two distinct categories: changing consumer purchasing and food preparation habits in order to minimize the immediate risk of infection, and supporting legislative and regulatory food safety reforms that would minimize the risk of future outbreaks. Particular media focus was given to both the US Food Safety Modernization Act and the FDA Egg Rule. Relatively little media attention was given to industrial agriculture as a causal frame or the purchasing of alternative eggs as a potential response.

Policy measures include government purchase of rice, output payment, and acreage control. The simulation result shows that acreage control has been the principal policy measure for transferring income to producers, especially since the enforcement of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. Acreage control is the policy measure with the lowest total efficiency and highest budgetary efficiency. This result implies that the government's goal of transferring income to producers with minimum government cost has been achieved through a combination of policy measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

People's ideologies with regard to food were multidimensional, falling along lines related to food health and quality, food safety, and farm subsidies. Respondents were most in favor of additional government action related to food safety. Food ideology was related to conventional measures of political ideology with, for example, more liberal respondents desiring more government involvement in food than more conservative respondents, but the relationship was far from determinative, suggesting food ideology represents a unique construct in its own right.

Recent empirical studies on the impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on economic cohesion have been strikingly diverse in their principal findings. Whereas some studies suggest positive overall effects on economic cohesion, others stress exactly the opposite. One major reason for the ambiguous results is that a single agreed-upon measure of economic cohesion is lacking. We propose a concept that distinguishes between two dimensions of policy impacts on economic cohesion: (i) the redistributive impact at a defined period of time and (ii) the change of the redistributive impact over time. The first dimension addresses the question whether a policy makes the distribution of a target variable, e.g., income, more equal or unequal at one point of time. The second dimension covers the impact of the policy on the disparity of the same variable over time, i.e., the impact on convergence. An empirical illustration of the concept for 13 NUTS 1 regions in Germany over the period 1991-2009 reveals that the two policy impacts of the CAP are partly contradictory for the two dimensions. It is shown that the CAP fosters economic cohesion by reducing regional disparities in each individual year. With regard to redistributive impacts over time, we find that CAP transfers leave income convergence largely unaffected for society as a whole. Within the agricultural sector, it leads to a convergence of receipts per farm whereas it induces a divergence of farm receipts per hectare. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It addresses a set of related questions: (1) are herder mobility and other production decisions being altered by improved market opportunities; (2) what roles do markets play in pastoralist drought and drought recovery strategies; (3) which groups of producers are taking advantage of and/or benefiting from which market chains; and (4) what factors other than price help to explain why and when pastoralists sell livestock? The article concludes that macro-economic forecasts about supply response in the region may be overly optimistic and off target, because they fail to appreciate the non-price factors that influence pastoralist households' decisions to sell livestock.

This challenge is the target of collective action-based programs aiming at framing the cooperation context that would enable a local community to turn inherited resources and know-how into new market opportunities. Literature acknowledges that social capital is a crucial local resource for successful collective actions since it is a source of trust and collective commitment within a community. This paper deals with testing the role of this resource in the collective action case of the cheese producers in Aculco (Mexico). Focusing on the connectedness dimension of social capital, we propose an original methodology that relies on the multiplex and structural properties of social networks. This allows us to disentangle the opposite and ambivalent effects of social capital on the ability of a community to reach the goals assigned by the collective action program. Our empirical study shows that these critical properties can work in favor of adherence to collective action but can also create elite capture, clannish behaviors and entry barriers, thus showing a failure of collective action.

Little work has been done examining the implications of the explosion of new media and web technologies, which may offer potential for improving food risk and benefit communication. First, this study examines the views of stakeholders (n = 38) and experts (n = 33) in the food domain on the potential use of these emerging media for food risk/benefit communication. Based on in-depth interviews in six European countries (Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Spain and The Netherlands), strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of social media in food risk and benefit communication were identified. Second, a Strategic Orientation Round (SOR) was used to evaluate the relative importance of the SWOT components according to stakeholders (n = 10) and experts (n = 13). Results show that both stakeholders and experts confirm a future role of social media in food risk and benefit communication. Strengths as speed, accessibility and interaction make social media an interesting tool in crisis communication or issue awareness raising. Weaknesses as the lack of a filter, low trust, the risk of information overload and a communication preference for traditional media are acknowledged. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the consumers' responsiveness to an increase in prices of the indigenous chicken products and how much they are willing to pay for them in the market. The survey was conducted in the selected three regions of Kenya. A total of 930 respondents were interviewed both in the urban and rural areas. Contingent valuation experiment was used in empirical data collection. The two-step Heckman selection model was utilised to analyse consumers decisions and the amount they were willing to pay. The study results revealed that consumers are willing to pay 23.26% per kg more for indigenous chicken meat and 41.53% for eggs. Socioeconomic factors like age, income, education and family size significantly determines consumers' willingness to pay. Other important factors include the indigenous chicken meat substitutes' prices, attributes like taste/flavour and the product's form on purchase. The yolk colour and size of eggs determined the consumers' willingness to pay. Preferences for indigenous chicken products were found to be high. This information will assist in understanding both the urban and rural consumer's behaviour. Therefore, useful for the indigenous chicken producers, breeders, marketers and policy makers in developing efficient production and marketing strategies. This would also provide a means of improving food security and livelihoods of the rural poor indigenous chicken farmers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Bett, H. K.; Peters, K.

Most research into the welfare effects of these food price changes assumes constant demand or approximates second order substitution effects. Poverty forecasts with these assumptions may overestimate or underestimate the effect of food price increases in a nation where most households consume diverse food baskets. We account for full substitution by calculating a theoretically consistent food demand system, accounting for household responses to food price changes by decreasing some food purchases and increasing other food purchases. We use Mexican data to confirm the mitigation of adverse welfare effects from food price increases after accounting for country-specific dietary preferences in modeling demand. In comparison to previous literature, our welfare measures predict theoretically consistent numbers of Mexican households entering poverty due to recent food price changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In their choice of farming practices, producers are influenced by market forces as well as public and private safety regulations or macro-drivers as opposed to farm-level micro-drivers. Growers respond to their business and regulatory environment by implementing integrated pest management (IPM) and other good agricultural practices (GAP), where profitable through certification schemes. Our paper attempts to analyse the adoption of sustainable farming practices beyond farm and farmer characteristics, focusing on the role of structural and institutional macro-drivers. The empirical research is based on the comparison between Turkey and Morocco, two Mediterranean countries with high export activity in the fresh tomato sector but with contrasting features in terms of both sustainable farming practices and micro/macro-drivers. With regard to the latter, we simultaneously consider supply-side and demand-side aspects (i.e. the requirements of buyers in importing countries). The analysis draws on the literature examining both IPM/GAP adoption and the impact of food safety regulation on firms' strategies. We call on face-to-face interviews with a relatively large number of tomato growers in the main production areas (N = 86 in Morocco and N = 186 in Turkey). Our findings show that the average level of sustainable practices is greatly affected by national market and institutional particularities, in particular on the demand side. Moreover the surveys confirm the initial assumption of the major role played by private actors in managing safety risk when there are high business stakes, as in export chains oriented towards rich Western countries.

Kenya is a relatively densely populated area, with 40% of its rural people residing on 5% of its rural land. We develop a structural model for estimating the impact of population density on input and output prices, farm size, and ultimately on smallholder behavior and agricultural intensification. Evidence is derived from a five-round panel survey between 1997 and 2010. We find a negative relationship between localized population density and farm size, and a positive relationship between population density and measures of land intensification up to roughly 500 persons/km(2). Beyond this threshold, rising population density is not associated with further increases in land intensification. Some measures of intensification actually show an alarming decline beyond this population density threshold. We also find a relatively weak relationship between population density and off-farm income. Overall, total household income per adult equivalent is found to decline significantly as population density rises. These findings raise serious policy questions about feasible pathways for rural poverty reduction in the context of increasingly land-constrained farming systems.

This study analyzes the factors underpinning this growth. We find that the growth of emergent farmers in Zambia is primarily attributable to land acquisition by salaried urbanites and by relatively privileged rural individuals. We found little evidence to support the hypothesis that the rise of emergent farmers primarily represents a process of successful accumulation by farmers who began farming with less than 5 ha of land, a situation faced by more than 95% of farming households. We argue that these outcomes are the result of Zambia's land administration and agricultural spending policies. Rising concentration of landholdings in Zambia raises serious questions about the potential of current agricultural growth to act as a vehicle for broad based economic growth and poverty reduction.

The program was implemented in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 2001 to 2009. We apply propensity score matching, Rosenbaum bounds on treatment effects, Altonji et al. method of selection on observables and unobservables and endogenous switching regression to farm survey data collected during the 2009 cropping season. We use these methods to test whether the R4D program has a statistically significant effect on outcomes of interest and if these are not driven by selection on unobservables. Using propensity score matching, we find statistically significant positive effects on household participation in cassava markets, adoption of improved varieties and crop management practices and household food adequacy; and no statistically significant effects on yields and profits. The results show that bias due to selection on unobservables is not severe enough to invalidate the impact estimates. Bias may still be a problem that is present in the analysis. But there is evidence that it is not substantial. Although the program does not have a statistically significant positive effect on yields and profits, the significant program effects on market participation, variety adoption, and food adequacy merit further promotion of the program since these positive outcomes tend to be pre-conditions for realizing long-term yield and profit benefits.

After nearly a decade of stalled progress, the government reported a reduction in stunting rates of nearly 10 points, from 29.8% in 2005 to 18.1% in 2011. The specialized literature has acknowledged the critical role that immediate (e.g. increasing breastfeeding promotion) and underlying (e.g. investments to improve household food security) interventions have played in reducing stunting (Black et al., 2013), as well as the contributing role of enabling factors related to economic performance. This paper offers an alternative explanation to success by looking at the shift in the government's nutrition strategy after 2006 with the formation of the Child Malnutrition Initiative (CMI), a civil society working platform, and the adoption of a national poverty reduction strategy prioritizing nutrition interventions (known as CRECER) and conditional cash transfers (JUNTOS). The paper uses veto players theory to explain how these changes effectively contributed to policy change by reducing the effective number of nutrition stakeholders involved and facilitating policy agreements around a common policy platform and established goals. The Peruvian case also highlights the importance of the government's public commitment to reduce chronic malnutrition in children under five by 5 percent in 5 years (5 by 5 by 5) and the accompanying role, advocacy and monitoring from civil society organizations. The paper looks at the success of implementing the nutrition strategy in three dimensions. Horizontally, it looks at the coordination between government and non-government agencies to converge around a common policy discourse;vertically, it looks at the implementation of the nutrition strategy across national, regional and municipal governments;and financially, it looks at the coordinated and conditional allocation of nutrition funding and how this created greater incentives for horizontal and vertical coordination. The paper draws some theoretical and policy implications for improving the effective and accountable delivery of nutrition interventions in Peru and other countries outside Latin America.

This article examines this issue by estimating the heterogeneous impacts of Bt corn adoption at different points of the yield distribution using farm-level survey data from the Philippines. A recently developed estimation technique called instrumental variable quantile regression (IVQR) is used to assess the heterogeneous yield effects of Bt corn adoption and at the same time address potential selection bias that usually plague impact assessment of agricultural technologies. We find that the positive yield impact of Bt corn in the Philippines tend to be more strongly felt by farmers at the lower end of the yield distribution. This result suggests that Bt corn could be a pro-poor technology since most of the lower-yielding farmers in the Philippines are poor smallholders with low incomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Food price is one way through which climate change may affect health. The aim of this study of the global and Australian food systems is to provide a whole-of-system analysis of food price vulnerabilities, highlighting the key pressure points across the food system through which climate change could potentially have the greatest impact on consumer food prices and the implications for population health. We outline areas where there are particular vulnerabilities for food systems and food prices arising from climate change, particularly global commodity prices; agricultural productivity; short term supply shocks; and less direct factors such as input costs and government policies. We use Australia as a high-income country case study to consider these issues in more detail. The complex and dynamic nature of pricing mechanisms makes it difficult to predict precisely how prices will be impacted. Should prices rise disproportionately among healthy foodstuffs compared to less healthy foods there may be adverse health outcomes if less expensive and less healthy foods are substituted. Higher prices will also have equity implications with lower socio-economic groups most impacted given these households currently spend proportionately more of their weekly income on food. The ultimate objective of this research is to identify the pathways through the food system via which climate change may affect food prices and ultimately population health, thereby providing evidence for food policy which takes into account environmental and health considerations.

In the current study, a distinction has been made between pre-purchase consumer decision-making, on the one hand, and purchase and post-purchase consumer decision-making, on the other. Purchase and post-purchase decisions are those that affect their actions directly. These include vehicle selection to purchase the products, shelf-time in the household or the cooking method employed. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the environmental profile in terms of carbon footprint (CF), of a range of scenarios with varying direct environmental decisions performed by consumers. More specifically, the CF of an iconic frozen seafood product in Spain (one package of frozen fish sticks of Patagonian grenadier) was modeled for a total of 24 scenarios of fish sticks consumption. Results showed a high variance in environmental impacts depending on the scenario chosen, proving the high variability in CF that the consumption of frozen seafood can show depending on consumer choices or needs. Additionally, results showed the relative importance of the consumption stage within the entire supply chain in terms of GHG emissions. Hence, important reductions may be achieved in the diet of an individual merely by improving the behavioral traits when purchasing and consuming food products. Consequently, consumers, if given the correct environmental guidelines through awareness campaigns, can play an active and relevant role in the reduction of the environmental profile of seafood products through behavioral modifications when purchasing and consuming them.

Local (independent) traders still constitute a major market for coffee producers. Yet, cooperatives also accept the produce from non-members and pay them the same price. Our objective in this paper is to analyse the importance of this phenomenon of double side-selling. We collected data from a sample of 170 coffee farmers. We use a probit model to analyse characteristics linked to cooperative membership and to study double side-selling. We describe the trade relationships between farmers and the cooperative on the one hand, and between farmers and traders on the other by the attributes of transaction costs involved in the trade of coffee. Membership characteristics include easy access to labour, land tenure, risk aversion, and mutual trust between farmers and cooperatives' management. Preference to sell to traders can be explained by the trust farmers seem to have in them after the repeated transactions in credit and basic consumption items and by long-term relationships in the community.

In this paper, we adopt a partial equilibrium approach to analyze the short-time effects of a staple food price increase on nutritional attainments, as a measure of welfare. The analysis consists of first approximating complete food-demand systems and then performing household level micro-simulations. Instead of focusing on a single country profile, we provide a more complete snapshot by comparing the evidence through a cross-country assessment made possible by the use of nationally representative household surveys. Comparability is assured by the adoption of the same methodological choices in the treatment of the micro data. We find that food price spikes not only reduce the mean consumption of dietary energy, but also worsen the distribution of food calories, further deteriorating the nutritional status of populations. We also discovered that access to agricultural land plays a significant role in ensuring adequate nutritional attainments in rural areas, and surprisingly, even in urban areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A conceptual model was developed to elicit subjective risk perceptions for a multidimensional construct. In general, differences were found between respondent categories in terms of both specific source risks and overall risks. Differences were also found with respect to the socio-demographic and structural determinants of the levels of perceived risks.

The intensity of these impacts is crucial when it comes to detecting strategies to promote sustainable consumption of food and beverages, as in the case of wine. In fact, neglecting the occurrence of REs in wine production and delivery leads to under- or over-estimating the effects that novel more sustainable technologies may produce. An in-depth analysis on the ways in which the stakeholders may react to the availability of a new product (e.g. wine produced through a process oriented to the reduction of CO2 emissions) may be particularly useful to allow producers and consumers to target the REs with respect to the overall goals of desired sustainability. In this article, we first provide a definition and a classification of different types of REs and then analyse some exemplificative cases applied to the supply and consumption of wine produced through technologies that reduce environmental emissions or resource consumptions.

There are many techniques used to detect the presence of adulterants, however this approach relies on the adulterant or means of substitution being known and no food item can ever be declared truly free of adulteration on that basis. Further techniques will verify the provenance claims made about a food product e.g. breed, variety etc. as well as techniques to identify original geographic location of food production. These consider wholeness, or not, of a food item and do not need to necessarily identify the actual adulterant. The conceptual framework developed in this research focuses on the process of predicting, detecting and reacting to economically and criminally motivated food adulteration. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate preference heterogeneity by linking stated preference choice data not only to socioeconomic characteristics but also to attitudinal statements in a latent class framework. The empirical results indicate the existence of class-specific preference heterogeneity based on the consumers' attitude towards functional foods, emphasizing the importance of attitudinal data in explaining consumers' choice behavior. Our estimates demonstrate that within a class, consumers' preferences are in accordance with their responses to attitudinal statements, that is functional food skeptics prefer non-functional dairy products, while functional food advocates have a negative preference for non-functional dairy products. The findings also show that all consumers place high value on dairy products enriched with known functional ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Fish is central to the Bangladeshi diet and small fish species are an important micronutrient source. Although fish consumption per capita has increased in recent years as a result of rapid expansion of aquaculture, it is likely that consumption of fish from capture fisheries (including small indigenous species particularly rich in micronutrients), has declined. This paper evaluates data on fish consumption collected in Bangladesh by the International Food Policy Research Institute in 1996/7 and 2006/7 to assess changing patterns of fish consumption and their implications for food and nutrition security. This analysis indicates that growth of aquaculture has been positive, mitigating a sharp reduction in the quantity of fish consumed from capture fisheries and smoothing out seasonal variability in consumption. However, increased availability of fish from aquaculture may not have fully compensated for the loss of fish from capture fisheries in terms of dietary diversity, micronutrient intakes and food and nutrition security, particularly for the poorest consumers. A range of approaches are recommended to sustain and enhance the contributions capture fisheries and aquaculture make to food and nutrition security in Bangladesh (C) 2013 The Authors.

The analysis combines food availability data at the household level with country-specific land use data for food items. The household food availability data is obtained from a standardized and post-harmonized databank, developed in the Data Food Networking Project (DAFNE). The results show large differences between the land use of the 16 European countries, ranging from 1500 m(2) (Ireland) to 3000 m(2) (Malta) to supply an average person's food demand. Major reasons for this divergence include disparities in total caloric food availability and in national yields. The composition of the diet is only a minor source of variation. Using food consumption data at the household level makes it also possible to look for sources of variation within countries. This paper investigates sources of variation within countries by examining the influence of education of the household head on land use associated with food consumption. The analysis shows that diets of people with only elementary education need on average 20% more land than diets of people with a higher education (2302 m(2) and 1948 m(2), respectively). The basis of this difference is the higher caloric availability for people with only an elementary education; the influence of differences in the composition of the diet is negligible. Variation in land use between countries is thus caused by the different agricultural productivities and caloric availabilities, and the major source of variation within countries is the caloric availability. The composition of the diet is only a minor source of variation, both between and within countries. The results implicate that highly educated people have a lower demand for land.

The empirical investigation is based on an integrated approach consisting of a stochastic method and CGE model. The former, related to the Monte Carlo analysis, provides the likely changes in rainfall patterns and their probability of occurrence based on historical data. These results are at the basis of the scenarios simulated in a standard CGE model augmented with a stochastic component. Achievements underline the negative impact on the two dimensions of food security taken into consideration, mainly due to a reduction in cereal supply, a marked cereal inflation pressure and income contraction; the greater negative effect on the poorest households; and a deterioration of the economic performance of the country. In this context, the paper stresses a strong interconnection among climate change and variability, poverty and food insecurity and thus the need for an integrated policy-making approach.

Cross-sectional data were collected in 2008 through a consumer survey (n = 3213) in the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the UK. Consumers' knowledge about fish generally, and about aquaculture in particular, was relatively low and differed significantly between countries. Consumers from all countries reported an indication of quality and/or food safety as an information cue when buying fish. The information sources most frequently used by Europeans were labelling and sellers in retail or supermarkets. The Internet was identified by consumers in all of the countries as one of the most important sources of information about sea and freshwater fish products. Policy makers and food marketers are encouraged to develop a simple and easily recognisable mark (relating to quality, food safety and nutrition) to assist consumer decision-making. Information campaigns focusing on issues such as the nutritional benefits of eating fish are also recommended. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The study utilizes cross-sectional farm household level data collected in 2008 from a randomly selected sample of 1313 households (700 in Ethiopia and 613 in Tanzania). The causal impact of technology adoption is estimated by utilizing endogenous switching regression. This helps us estimate the true welfare effect of technology adoption by controlling for the role of selection problem on production and adoption decisions. Our analysis reveals that adoption of improved agricultural technologies has a significant positive impact consumption expenditure (in per adult equivalent terms) in rural Ethiopia and Tanzania. This confirms the potential role of technology adoption in improving rural household welfare as higher consumption expenditure from improved technologies translate into lower poverty, higher food security and greater ability to withstand risk. An analysis of the determinants of adoption highlighted inadequate local supply of seed, access to information and perception about the new cultivars as key constraints for technology adoption.

This paper addresses these concerns in relation to Uruguay, a small country that exports agricultural commodities and imports fuels. Applying a general equilibrium model, we find that, as a whole, an increase in commodity prices has a positive effect on the economy of Uruguay. Benefits obtained through a growth in export activities are partially outweighed by an increase in crude oil prices. In this context, extreme poverty increases. As in other countries, the increase in food prices affects the already poor population, who become even poorer. This fact highlights the need for policies that mitigate the negative effects of price shocks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

An Ordinal Regression Model was used in which the dependent variable is discrete and ordered and is expressed in terms of BMI ordinal categories. The analysis revealed that people with excess weight display a high level of interest in nutrition claims, namely, short and immediately recognised messages. Conversely, obese individuals assign less importance to marketing attributes (price, brand, and flavour) compared with normal weight consumers. Socio-demographic and life-style characteristics affect the rate of obesity, highlighting that the most vulnerable segments of population are more susceptible to excess weight problems.

Using trade data from 1995 to 2012, livestock commodity exports are classified based on technology intensity. Employing a method of reflection in computing the economic complexity of export products, we find that one fifth of African livestock commodity exports are manufactured with low technology while the rest is composed of raw materials. The results also show that the ten most complex livestock commodities represent about a third of African livestock total exports while the world level is almost double this figure. Yet African countries spend a huge share of their wealth on importing complex products. The results imply that by exporting non-complex products Africa loses nearly a third of the total value of its livestock exports. To boost the value of livestock products, African countries should exploit their untapped potential while securing the domestic market to achieve import substitution. This can be done by integrating with global value chains or developing niche markets at the regional or international markets and improving productive capabilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Such efforts, however, have largely focused on production potential and have underemphasized economic profitability and other constraints to expansion. This paper re-estimates PAC for Africa in a more explicit economic framework that emphasizes the returns to agricultural production under a variety of assumptions, using recent geospatial data. Existing PAC estimates for Africa are shown to be highly sensitive to assumptions about land productivity and market access, and are moderately influenced by the use of alternative data sources. The region's underutilized land resources are concentrated in relatively few countries, many of which are fragile states. Between one-half and two-thirds of the region's surplus land is currently under forest cover; conversion of forests to cropland would entail major environmental costs. Most of the continent's unexploited land resources are located far from input and output markets, limiting their economic attractiveness. In the long run, improvements in infrastructure and agricultural productivity and the growth of hinterland towns will enhance the economic returns to cropland expansion. In the short to medium term, however, the potential for profitable smallholder-based cropland expansion in most African countries is likely to be much more limited than it is typically perceived to be.

Through applying the theories of farming systems evolution and of induced innovation in technical change, this paper shows that demand for certain mechanized farming operations particularly plowing has emerged even among smallholders, suggesting that supply issues may now be the main constraint to successful mechanization. We therefore adopt a supply chain approach to analyze two types of mechanization practices in Ghana, i.e., a recent state-led mechanization program and the private sector-led service hiring market, against an international perspective by drawing on three Asian supply models. We identify two major flaws in existing policies. First, the agricultural mechanization service centers that the government promotes fail to use tractors services with sufficient intensity. Second, direct importation of agricultural machinery by the government inhibits imports of appropriate and affordable machinery. In contrast, the development of mechanized service hiring market in which medium and large scale farmers who are tractor owners provide hiring-out services to small-scale farmers represents a promising model for sustainable mechanization in Ghana. This private sector-led second model is consistent with international experiences.

It found that the primary producer found value in both systems, although from a food hygiene focus regulation was seen to be more rigorous. Other stakeholders along the dairy food supply chain saw the assurance scheme as more rigorous. All stakeholders recognised the need to reduce duplication in delivering food safety through combining key elements of both systems with the added potential for better communication of both food safety and quality to the final consumer.

Unfortunately, the determinants of these variations remain understudied because the agencies that run these programs seldom publicize the allocations of subsidized food to local markets. We develop a theoretical model of pilferage which predicts that: (i) pilferage from opaque programs is likely to rise more than proportionately with per capita food allocations; (ii) pilferage of inferior goods may be lower in poorer communities; (iii) pilferage rates need not rise as price subsidies are increased; and (iv) pilferage may rise as the relative quality of subsidized food is reduced. A comprehensive literature review and new estimates of pilferage across regions of the Philippines validates these predictions. Our finding, that around 48% of the subsidized rice went missing, is robust to new tests for sampling and recall error. Our policy discussion encourages geographic over administrative targeting, greater transparency in food allocations, and the use of realistic quotas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper assesses the extent and determinants of spatial price dispersion for 14 perfectly homogeneous food products in more than 400 retailers in a market characterized by the persistence of a large number of relatively small traditional food stores, alongside large supermarkets. The extent of observed price dispersion is quite high. When prices in an urban area (where the spatial concentration of sellers is higher) are compared with those in smaller towns and rural areas, differences in search costs and the potentially higher degree of competition do not yield lower prices. Other counteracting factors, including differences in seller costs and consumer incomes, make prices, on average, higher in the urban area for 11 of the 14 products considered. For many, but not all, the products supermarkets proved to be less expensive than traditional retailers, although average savings from food shopping at supermarkets were extremely low. Finally, the results of the study provide evidence that retailers have different pricing strategies and these differences also emerge for supermarkets belonging to the same chain. The results presented in the paper suggest that a variety of factors play a role in explaining price dispersion. In addition to differences in seller costs, the contemporaneous heterogeneity of retailers (in terms of services provided) and consumers (in terms of search costs and preferences) makes the emergence of monopolistic competition possible as well as allowing small traditional food retailers to remain in business.

The hypothesis is that less prior consumer knowledge will result in a larger framing effect. That is, if the subjective knowledge of the public is low, then the controversy created by mass media regarding a specific food-related event will be larger. Empirical results show that message frame has an influence on college students' purchasing intentions. College students showed distinct responses in purchasing intention based on different headlines and different amounts of information within articles. The results further suggest that the framing effect depends not only on message frames, but also on the prior knowledge of the message recipient. Those who have less knowledge have larger variation in their purchase intention when responding to different message frames. This suggests that people with less knowledge are more likely to panic due to mass media reports regarding a food hazard issue. More informed consumers have less dramatic responses to food safety issues compared to less informed people. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We also find marginally statistically significant increases in weight-for-height z-scores and weight-for-age z-scores of about 0.4 standard deviations among children aged 0-5 years in households that were recipients of meat goats, and increases in height-for-age z-scores of about 0.5 standard deviations among children in households that received dairy cows.

Most studies investigate the impact of sanitary regulations introducing directly in the analysis the MRL put in force in the importing country. They introduce in the analysis the level of the regulation in the importing country without taking into account the rule in force in the exporting country. Rather than focusing on a particular pesticide we take into account the entire list of substances set out by the various regulations. We then build a similarity index and introduce it into a gravity equation to assess the impact of the differences in MRL of pesticides on trade.

A multi-scale conceptual framework is proposed to analyze market functioning and transformation over time and space. We extend Commons and Fligstein's work on market institutions to define the notion of competition regime as a combination of four market institutions that legitimizes competition strategies. We also mobilize Ostrom's work on common property rights regimes to show that a competition regime relies on the creation and management of two systems of common-pool resources, namely innovation capacity and reputation-building. This paper then shows the relevance of this framework through the case study of the current restructuring of dairy supply chains in mountainous areas in France. It shows that market liberalization strongly destabilizes the regional competition regimes that were based on the appropriation of social rights inherent to the national public policies. In the hybrid and specific competition regimes, existing territorial coordination devices are not directly threatened and can support the development of new cooperative strategies. In all cases, with the development of a contractual economy, farmers are incited to develop or to strengthen coordination devices to become effective market participants. Through the development of large territorial producers' organizations capable of managing milk supply in volume and quality, they would be able to take part in the management of the supply chains. To do so, the present paper suggests that farmers' organizations need material and immaterial investments and assistance from regional public players to build new local collective capacities. The competition regime framework is an asset for the design of such public supports in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, taking the regional specificity of the markets' institutions and collective capacities into account.

We find that areas of higher population density are associated with smaller farm sizes, lower real agricultural wage rates, and higher real maize prices. Any input intensification that occurs seems to be going to increasing maize yields, as we find no evidence that increases in population density enable farmers to increase gross value of crop output per hectare. We also find evidence that households in more densely populated areas increasingly rely on off-farm income to earn a living, but there appears to be a rural population density threshold beyond which households can no longer increase off-farm income per capita.

However, the beef industry has not fully taken advantage of utilizing nutrition and health claims based on the EU nutrition labelling policy to differentiate beef products in the market. This study investigates consumer preferences for nutrition and health claims on lean beef steak. Two choice experiments were conducted among 2400 beef consumers in four EU countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United and United Kingdom). Multinomial logit and error component models were estimated. Our results generally suggest that consumer valuation of nutritional and health claims varies across countries. In Belgium, the Netherlands and France, nutrition and health claims on saturated fat yielded higher utilities than claims on protein and/or iron, while the opposite was found among consumers in the UK. The results imply that marketing opportunities related to nutrition and health claims on beef are promising, but that different nutritional marketing strategies are necessary within different countries.

Two dimensions of maize market performance are evaluated: (1) inter-regional trade and spatial price transmission; and (2) storage and seasonal price relationships. In both cases, threshold autoregression models which account for nonlinearities predicted by economic theory are applied. Results indicate that spatial price transmission and seasonal price patterns in private sector maize markets in Malawi are generally consistent with long-run competitive inter-regional trade and storage behavior, and that in most cases shocks to long-run equilibrium are arbitraged away quickly. This suggests the private sector in Malawi is generally doing a good job of transporting maize from surplus to deficit regions and smoothing maize consumption between harvests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members. The results suggest that cooperatives can play an important role in accelerating the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Area-wide management (AWM) of crop pests is an alternative strategy for pest control to reliance on the uncoordinated control decisions of farmers. Relative to uncoordinated pest control, AWM has been shown to be cost-effective and, by reducing pesticide use, environmentally beneficial. The fact that AWM schemes provide imperfect public goods and are prone to free-riding means that most successful schemes depend on government funding, regulation, coordination and management. The economics of AWM concerns the economics of information and time in complex bioeconomic settings. This paper explores the economics of AWM in relation to Queensland fruit fly (Qfly), Bactrocera tryoni (Frogatt), a damaging pest and a major barrier to Australian trade in horticultural produce. We analyse the economics of roadblocks, surveillance and eradication. The results show that returns from tighter roadblocks are greater than returns from increased surveillance and enhanced eradication capacity. These results depend on market access rules, the spatial extent of the pest free area, the horticultural commodities at risk, and pest ecology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Standard deviation parameters in the RPL models are highly significant, indicating that individuals have widely varying preferences for soy-based food products.

Within the wide range of development options available, this paper focuses on the impact of forage-growing subsidies and reducing livestock feed trade barriers on agricultural household incomes and enterprise mixes in the Qingyang Prefecture of Gansu Province, China. A heterogeneous-agent model is used to assess the local consequences of these two policies. Data from a survey conducted in 2009 are used as inputs into the model. The results indicate that a simultaneous reduction in livestock feed trade barriers and an introduction of forage-growing subsidies lifts net household incomes by approximately 10%. Different scenarios have different impacts on incomes, land allocation decisions and grain purchases, with heterogeneity also found among household income responses. Livestock-development policies have the potential to lift household incomes however there are tradeoffs between income and grain self-sufficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper considers four issues in ex-post evaluation of animal disease interventions: firstly, a counterfactual involves simulating disease trajectories without the intervention. But some diseases can become endemic or become dormant after an outbreak, making it a challenge to know the true trajectory without the intervention. Secondly, without adequate design of controls and treatments, how can the estimated impacts be attributed to a given intervention? Thirdly, how do we assess costs saved by the intervention? Fourthly, given data uncertainty, would a stochastic simulation give better estimates than a deterministic one in solving for key variables? This paper addresses these issues and proposes solutions that bridge the gap between household level analysis and macro-level simulations in modelling the impact of animal diseases outbreaks.

S.",,,Politics & technology: US polices restricting unmanned aerial systems in agriculture,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Drone; FAA; Unmanned aerial vehicles; UAS; UAV,,"Many industry observers foresee that agriculture worldwide is posed to substantially benefit from the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), commonly known as drones. Industry special interests predict that 80% of domestic sales of UASs in the U.S. will be for agriculture. However, some fear that the public anxiety of the UAS operating in U.S. airspace could stall their introduction, a move that would potentially place some of American farmers' production practices at an economic disadvantage. Currently, this public policy controversy is influencing UAS integration into U.S. agriculture, with the potential of spilling over internationally. This project examines the nature of the current debate surrounding the UAS within the U.S., analyzes the impact on agriculture from the legislation considered, discusses policy options to ameliorate the controversy, and describes the factors that will likely determine UAS operations within the U.S. The information was obtained from government documents, academic research, industry studies, nonprofit organizations, and media reports. An analysis was done using these data on how UAS legislation may affect agriculture. Popularized images of the silent-kills overseas using militarized UASs, safety concerns, and a fear of privacy invasions were found to generate intense opposition to their domestic integration. Spurred by the FAA's congressional mandate to fully integrate UASs into the nation's airspace, a significant number of bills, particularly in state legislatures, have been introduced in an attempt to regulate UAS use. Although geared toward privacy protection and law enforcement, some laws may adversely affect agriculture because they create legal uncertainty and/or they sweepingly ban or highly curtail local UAS operations. Possible solutions have been proposed: (1) reducing the legal uncertainty regarding UASs, (2) adopting an industry Code of Conduct and Safe Practices, and (3) producing a consensus on UAS regulations among diverse groups through an open discussion of how to balance UAS operations with safeguards on privacy and property rights. The perceived economic potential of the UAS, particularly in agriculture, combined with the lobbying power of the UAS industry, strongly suggest that policy will eventually be developed that will allow the use of this technology for agriculture in U.S. airspace.

A similar firms' selection effect is induced by market size. In this paper, these predictions are tested across 25 European countries and 9 food industries, over the 1995-2008 period. Using different dynamic panel estimators we find strong support for the model predictions, namely that an increase in import penetration is systematically positively related to productivity growth. The results are robust to measurement issues in productivity, controlling for market size, country and sector heterogeneities, and for the endo-geneity of import competition. Interestingly, this positive relationship is almost exclusively driven by competition in final products coming from developed (especially EU-15) countries suggesting that EU food imports are closer substitutes for domestic production than non-EU imports. These results have some potentially interesting policy implications. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, we have limited knowledge regarding the putative role of the human rights dimension to the impact and management of such tragedies. In this article we assessed the present policies, legislation and institutional capabilities to ascertain whether they could assure the right to adequate food during disaster situations in Uganda. Using purposive sampling, 52 duty bearers working in institutions deemed relevant to food security, nutrition and disaster management were interviewed using a semi-structured guide. Relevant provisions from policy, legislation, institutional budgets and records of Parliament provided the context for analysis. The most important concern coming from the analyses of the information retrieved were inadequate preparedness mechanisms and capabilities. Whereas Uganda's Constitution proclaims the right to adequate food, and the need to establish a contingencies fund and commission responsible for disaster preparedness and management, they had not been instituted. Implementation of relevant policies appeared slow, especially with regard to assuring adequate relief food as a State obligation. Legislation to guarantee funding and institutionalisation of necessary disaster preparedness and management capabilities was not in place. An ambitious 5-year Uganda Nutrition Action Plan adopted in 2011 had not yet been funded by mid-2013, implying a reality gap in nutrition programming. Budget architecture and financing to disaster management have in effect fallen short of assuring adequate relief food as a human right. Due to capacity constraints, an approach of humanitarian relief may be entrenched in contradiction of State obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. To stay ahead of the potential threats, the Government with support of the Parliament and relevant partners need to enact legislation to appropriate budget resources needed to institute a mechanism of capabilities to implement the constitutional and policy provisions on the right to adequate food and disaster management.

Ex-ante impact assessment using integrated models can help them with these decisions. This review analyses the state of affairs of the multi-scale modelling of policy interventions, with an emphasis on applications in developing countries and livestock systems. Existing models do not sufficiently capture the complexity of human environment interactions across different scales, and especially the link between landscape and local market levels, and national and sub-national level policies and markets is missing. The paper suggests a step wise approach with increasing data needs to bridge this gap. Improvements need to be made at the description of effects of the distribution of local markets on price formation and the representation of farm diversity within a landscape. Analyses in contrasting agro-ecological systems are needed to derive generic summary functions that can be used as input for macro level model analyses. This is especially pertinent for macro level descriptions of crop and livestock production in relation to price developments and of the mosaic of different agricultural land use responses in regions with contrasting socio-economic conditions and developments.

Our results suggest that higher RPD is associated with smaller farm sizes, and has a positive effect on input demand, represented by increased fertilizer use per hectare. Overall, increased input use does not lead to a corresponding increase in staple crop yields, and thus farm income declines as population density increases. This suggests a situation where farmers in areas of high RPD may be stuck in place, unable to sustainably intensify in the face of rising RPD and declining farm sizes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on interviews with growers, marketers, activists, and other stakeholders, as well as secondary sources, this paper describes this policy's emergence and evolution using a global commodity chain approach. Several studies suggest that GE herbicide tolerant rice would yield profits for California growers struggling with rising weed control costs. Instead, GE rice was greeted with scrutiny by the California industry and legislators because Asian export markets had zero-tolerance for GE rice contamination. This paper examines how nature's agency-the unruly qualities of agro-ecosystem functions, the movement of wildlife, seeds, and pollen across space-strengthened narratives about risk and industry consensus around zero-tolerance rules for GE rice. In addition to recounting the origins of zero-tolerance demands and containment regulations for California rice, this research explores how calls for food safety and zero-tolerance rules are mobilized as surrogate for wider political economic aims.

The first implementation of mandatory country of origin labeling (MCOOL) in the United States was for seafood in 2005. This is an example of partial MCOOL because it exempts the foodservice sector and excludes processed seafood from labeling. Using a conceptual framework, we analyze the welfare impacts of partial MCOOL when compared to no, voluntary, and total mandatory COOL, taking into account imperfect competition in the downstream markets, information asymmetry, and diversion of low-quality product to the unlabeled market. The model is general enough to apply to any incomplete regulation for which the perceived low-quality product is required to be labeled, such as the labeling of genetically modified food in the European Union. Our results show that when consumers have a strong enough preference for domestic relative to imported product, regulators can overestimate the gain in consumer welfare from partial mandatory labeling if they ignore the diversion of lower quality imports to the unlabeled sector. We show that if the preference for domestic product is large enough, total MCOOL benefits the home market the most overall, including domestic consumers and producers, but not the imperfectly competitive downstream agents. However, if total MCOOL is too costly to implement, partial MCOOL is the second-best solution, but only if consumers falsely believe the unlabeled product to be of higher quality than it truly is. Our results suggest more research is needed to determine the extent to which consumers value the information provided by MCOOL and to enable regulators to consider the welfare impact of diversion in evaluating incomplete mandatory labeling regulations.

In this paper we investigate (1) the direct and interactive effects of seafood ecolabels with other common fish labels, and (2) how consumers' perceptions about the state of marine stocks and the valuation of ecolabels may be affected by different information. We find moderate interactive effects between ecolabels and country of origin labels, whereas the valuation for seafood ecolabels is fairly high. In terms of information, we find that consumers' perceptions about fish stock levels changed (negatively) after receiving information on declining stock levels, and more sensationalized information led to increased change. However, valuation for a seafood ecolabel increases only when the information was perceived positively (credible/interesting); whereas exaggerated information (which was also perceived less credible) had insignificant effects on WTP.

The purpose is to assess the potential for regional food systems to reduce selected environmental impacts, particularly the energy and GHG footprints, of consumer-ready, processed food products, when compared to national-scale food systems in which consumer products are shipped long distances. The study also examines the role of different types of food processing in influencing life cycle energy use, water use, and emissions. Our results indicate that California-produced conventional and organic tomato paste and canned diced tomatoes are almost equivalent in energy use and GHG emissions to regionally produced and consumed products, but use of developed water resources is significantly higher for California-grown products. California tomato production benefits from higher per hectare yields and soil amendments with lower carbon dioxide emissions. These efficiencies substantially offset the added energy use and GHG emissions associated with long-distance shipment of products to the Great Lakes region, as long as shipments are made by rail rather than by truck. Paste, the more processed and concentrated product evaluated, amplifies any environmental advantages or disadvantages accrued in the field production stage, due to its raw tomato to finished product ratio of 6:1, suggesting that comparative regional advantage can play a role in lowering life cycle environmental impacts of highly condensed foods shipped long distances.

Recent droughts reduced dryland farming production and the volume of water allocated to irrigated agriculture, with a resulting decline in aggregate agricultural production and exports. This paper analyses the possible impact of increased water scarcity on Australian agricultural production and the magnitude of subsequent impacts on global food security. Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on land and water use coupled with a hydro-economic stochastic modelling approach, the impacts of reduced agricultural production in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, and more generally for Australia, are analysed. Changes in agricultural activity, reduction in agricultural exports and altered composition of products exported attributed to the severe 2000-2009 drought are also analysed to highlight the implications for global food security. The impact of climate change on food production is examined. The analysis shows that climate change, when modelled as the extreme case, along with other factors such as land use, will impact Australian food exports. Despite its relatively small contribution to total global food supply, Australia's contribution to international trade in wheat, meat and dairy products is substantial and could affect global food prices. Furthermore, Australia's agricultural exports are of disproportionate importance within the South- and South-East Asian and Oceania region, both in terms of volume and for strategic reasons. Adaptation along with investment in agriculture production is needed to maintain Australian agricultural production and enhance global food security.

Palm oil production induces environmental damages, and its consumption presents a health risk. However, the production of alternative oils raises land use issues. In the experiment, successive messages emphasizing the characteristics of palm oil and palm oil-free products are delivered to participants. Information has a significant influence on WTP when it underlines the negative impact of the related product. This effect is stronger for the palm oil product than for the palm oil-free product. The experiment also compares the welfare effects of two regulatory instruments, namely a consumer information campaign versus a per-unit tax. Because of the respective attributes of both palm oil and palm oil-free products, the information campaign improves welfare with a much larger impact than the tax. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses the domestic market impact of wheat export controls in Russia and Ukraine during the 2007/2008 global food crisis within a spatial price transmission approach. Using a Markov-switching vector error-correction model, we contrast our estimation for Russia and Ukraine with Germany and the USA, two countries that did not intervene in their wheat export markets. An explicit crisis regime during times of export controls is exclusively identified for Russia and Ukraine. We find that export restrictions temporarily reduced the degree of integration of Russian and Ukrainian domestic markets in world wheat markets, which pushed the growers prices below their long-run equilibrium level. Further, domestic markets were disconnected from their equilibrium and market instability increased. These effects were even more pronounced and long lasting in Ukraine (export quota) than in Russia (export tax). The negative market effects discouraged private investors, thereby preventing Russia and Ukraine from maximizing their grain potential and contributing to global food security. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First, during this period, producers experienced significantly higher earnings and total income growth than non-producers (narrowing their income gap). Second, the negative effect on non-producers' real incomes was smaller in spatially well-connected areas, where, to mitigate the impact, private transfers (such as remittances) as well as employment incomes increased among non-producers. In contrast, government programs did not effectively cushion the income shock.

This phenomenon, or process, is known as 'The Nutrition Transition'. Several studies on adolescents in South Africa have shown that overweight and obesity are increasing, possibly due to this process. The aim of the present study was to extend our knowledge on the nutrition transition and the factors that influence adolescents' choice of food in South Africa, and to develop policy recommendations that could facilitate the adolescents' right to adequate food as laid down in the South African Constitutional Bill of Rights. The data were collected through focus groups with 25 female learners (grade 10, 14-16 years) from urban public schools in Cape Town and key informant interviews with 10 school staff members. The most important nutritional concerns that emerged from the analyses, included skipping breakfast and the consumption of unhealthy tuck shop food. In terms of the human right to adequate food, these findings reflected lack of availability and access to adequate food within the household, at schools, and in the community. In addition, the study showed that there were no or few opportunities for physical activity for adolescents during and after school hours. Social factors, including social norms and a need to conform to peer group pressure, appeared to affect the behaviour of learners considerably. Traditional foods appeared to have lost their importance, while learners preferred to consume fast foods and to adopt a more westernised diet connected to affluence and social acceptance. Traditional and more Western body perceptions co-existed among the study participants. The nutrition transition in South Africa is of a complex nature because of large differences that exist amongst different ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Policy decisions should be based on an understanding of these diverse factors. The media and the food industry should be encouraged to work with government in influencing adolescents to make healthy food choices. Cultural perceptions which may lead to unhealthy choices and lifestyle need to be addressed while at the same time respecting people's cultural pride and human dignity. It is recommended that human rights principles are used purposively in the future in policy formulations, interventions, evaluation and monitoring. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end we construct two alternative indicators to capture informational cascades created in rural areas. The first indicator is based on demographic characteristics while the other one on profitability considerations since farmers are likely to imitate the behavior of more successful farmers. Building upon the theoretical findings of Foster and Rosenweig (1995), Munshi (2004), Bandiera and Rasul (2006) and Weber (2012), we find that informational cascades are indeed important in revising farmers' perceptions and adoption behavior in both rural areas of Europe. Our results show that conversion subsidies can enhance social network effects internalizing informational externalities even in areas where adoption rates are considerable. This finding is independent of the crop and the country under consideration underlying the importance of informational cascades for technology adoption. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A variety of production system characteristics serve as parameters to achieve higher animal welfare standards. Food policies will be more effective if they position compromise products on those production system characteristics that really matter to (segments of) consumers. The present study identifies that three market segments may be discerned; one that takes a more inclusive perspective on animal welfare, and two that take a more heuristic approach by viewing animal friendliness from a more uni-dimensional perspective (animal space vs. slaughter method). These segments do not only differ in their perception of animal welfare, but also regarding their background characteristics. An interesting finding of the research is that the different segments accord in their perceptions of overall animal welfare levels, but do so for different reasons. In terms of food policy implications this means that the further development of compromise products would benefit from communicating more specific information on animal space and slaughter method, in addition to the overall star-based animal welfare classification. Such communication would serve well to both 50% of the market that takes a more balanced and integrated view on animal welfare and the other half of the market that takes a more uni-dimensional perspective (space vs. slaughter method).

It presents the outcomes of a qualitative research study of Canada's beleaguered beef industry, and investigates institutional learning and adaptation following an outbreak of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in particular. The analysis is guided by a concern with tensions between stability and change in adaptation. It draws on conceptual research on risk and the construction of non-problematicity as a means of symmetrically investigating how risk responses to BSE both opened up and closed down reflexive scrutiny of food and food safety systems. Specific attention is paid to constraints on adaptation imposed by preoccupations with market-led regulation, scientific risk analysis and the maintenance of institutional relations in the face of a potential public controversy. The paper concludes that in order to contend with recurrent crises in modern food-safety systems it is necessary to widen adaptive strategies, and to scrutinise agricultural priorities and food policy as essential aspects of adaptation.

While much has been written on the phenomenon, scant reliable empirical evidence is available as to the precise geographic and sectoral patterns and underlying drivers. Employing strict data quality requirements, this paper addresses these knowledge gaps by analyzing 563 farmland projects that have been established between 2005 and 2013 in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that the investment intensity and associated risks are not geographically uniform. Moreover, the study highlights a number of popular misconceptions regarding investor origin and their sectoral interests and motives. (C) 2014 The Author.

These include the level of self-sufficiency, the agricultural sector's dependence on imported inputs, and openness of the economy. An interesting parallel between the food security debate and that of security of energy supplies is also explored. A quantitative assessment of the security of external food supply, based on indices borrowed from the recent literature on energy security, shows that whilst the position of the UK may have worsened slightly, the level of external supply risk is very low. In consequence, security of food supply in the UK does not appear to be an issue that warrants alarm or undue concern, although the debate is likely to rumble on. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

From a methodological viewpoint it shows how to carry out an impacts evaluation of exogenous shocks on poverty and inequality in a context characterised by out-of-equilibrium, poorly-adjusting markets, as it is the case in many developing countries, using a social accounting matrix framework. From an empirical viewpoint it provides an assessment of how the cereal price spikes of 2007-2008 and the global recession of 2008-2009 have impacted the welfare of Syrian households and how did they compound with the on-going agricultural sector liberalisation implemented by the Government of Syria since mid 1990s. This will contribute to shed some lights on the economic background behind the spreading of unrest across the country over the last couple of years or so. The results show that liberalisation impacts are very different and largely affected by the adopted budget closure rules. While reforms aiming at reducing agricultural market distortions (such as production subsidies and price support for strategic crops) could generally have a positive effect on growth, poverty and inequality, the elimination of food security interventions (such as food stamp schemes) determines an adverse distributional impact against rural household and an increase of poverty. The recent macroeconomic shocks (food price crisis and the global recession) determined a generalised poverty increase and showed an income distribution bias against rural households. Three fundamental policy implications can be drawn by this study. First, the liberalisation of agricultural sector shows a significant growth potential and is likely to determine positive effects on poverty through a generalised increase of incomes as well as public budget savings that could be used for pursuing other policy goals. Second, in the short-run there is a structural trade-off between equity improvements and poverty alleviation: the policy options that will more likely reduce absolute poverty show undesirable distributive biases (both on overall inequality and on rural households vis-A-vis urban households). Third, the reform should include a careful design of the use of budget savings, mainly to address equity goals that are likely to be generated, in the short-run, by liberalisation.

I use data from a mail survey to evaluate the elements of trust for a range of groups connected to the U.S. food industry. The results point to organizationally variable and dependent perceptions of trust rather than a stable set of elements, suggesting that scholars might focus productively on the ways elements of trust are distributed.

This study applies choice experiments to analyse preferences of US and German consumers towards the meat attributes enhanced by the packaging. Results show that longer shelf life is preferred in the US as long as the technology is understandable. Consumers in both countries have clear preferences for cherry red meat colour.

This review evaluates the current state of energy efficiency during household cooking in developed countries and identifies potential policy changes that may have an impact on reducing energy consumption. The primary factors affecting energy consumption include: (1) the production and transport efficiency of fuel sources (electricity, natural gas, wood, etc.); (2) the appliance (or end-use) efficiency; and (3) the behavior of the consumer during cooking. Regarding appliance efficiencies, some improvements are plausible and policies should be directed towards reducing or alleviating stand-by energy consumption in new products. However, the most promising energy conservation tactic is consumer behavior modifications since individual cooking practices can reduce expenditures by as much as 95%; thus, policies should be directed towards consumer education to have the most marked effect on household energy consumption. Although cooking is only one aspect of food production, it is a universal requisite for food safety in the residential sector and implementing policies that reduce energy consumption during cooking may have an impact on global energy demands.

The effects of this development on small-scale farmers in developing countries are controversially discussed in the scientific debate. While small-scale farmers may benefit from standard compliance in terms of better market access and technology upgrading, non-compliance may lead to market exclusion and marginalization. The present study aims to identify the factors influencing a certification according to food safety and quality standards and the impact on farm management and income among exportoriented raspberry farmers in Chile. Survey data from 57 certified and 169 non-certified Chilean smallholder raspberry producers is analyzed. The analysis of the certification decision shows that small-scale farmers are less likely to implement food safety and quality standards. Once farmers are able to overcome the barriers and implement a food standard, we find that this has a positive effect on their quality performance and net raspberry income. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to reflect consumer awareness of the crisis, an avian influenza food scare information index is developed and used within the model as a transition variable. Our results suggest that price adjustments to deviations from the market equilibrium parity depend on the magnitude of the avian influenza crisis. Further these adjustments are found to have very different implications for market equilibrium: during the crisis retailers use their market power to increase marketing margins.

J,"Herdt, RW",,,,"Herdt, Robert W.",,,"People, institutions, and technology: A personal view of the role of foundations in international agricultural research and development 1960-2010",FOOD POLICY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,International agriculture; Foundations; Development aid; Global public goods; Adaptive research; Agricultural research; Capacity building; CGIAR,,"In the 1940 and 1950s, the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations initiated overseas rural and agricultural development activities in a number of countries in Asia and Latin America. They began with country programs. These programs often involved creating new institutions in the recipient countries, and while the perspective was long term - as long as it took to achieve program goals - the foundations also explicitly sought to work themselves out of a job and turn over responsibility to nationals. By 1960 the two foundations had moved beyond national assistance programs to invent a new model, the international agricultural research center, designed to improve the lives of poor rural people by increasing the productivity of developing world agriculture. Some of the national programs were morphed into international centers. The international agricultural research centers proved attractive to other donors and by the 1970s international agricultural research had become institutionalized in the form of the CGIAR and its associate centers. The 1960s India agricultural program of the Rockefeller Foundation comprised a team of about a dozen American scientists working in India assisting Indian scientists to invent new approaches to agricultural technology development. At the same time and also in India, the Ford Foundation pioneered the integrated rural development model. By the mid-1970s integrated rural development projects were the approach of choice for many donors. In the 19805 the Ford Foundation moved away from agriculture concentrating on broader social issues; the Government of India and Rockefeller Foundation decided Foundation scientists had, indeed, worked themselves out of their jobs and Rockefeller's India program was effectively closed down, although by then the international agricultural research centers, including ICRI-SAT in India, had attained a degree of maturity and stability. The Rockefeller Foundation invented another new model for agricultural research in the 1990s - the international rice biotechnology network, in which leading scientists from Asian countries, Western countries and the international centers worked together within a framework managed by Rockefeller scientists. In 2006, the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation entered the global agricultural scene in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation to establish AGRA, yet another new model. By 2010 the Gates Foundation was annually spending about 10 times what the 'old' foundations did and dominating international agricultural assistance, working across the spectrum of agricultural research, extension, and policy, largely focused in Africa. Five important lessons emerge that may be useful for addressing today's primary agricultural development challenge: that of improving the lives and well-being of people in Africa. First, it is critical not to underestimate the temporal and spatial variability of the biological and physical conditions in which agriculture operates; second, it is critical not to underestimate the institutional challenges of agricultural development; third, ever-renewing agricultural technology is essential and simply transferring technology from other parts of the world or from international research centers will have limited value without local adaptive research; fourth, every country needs its own people with the capacity to conduct adaptive agricultural research and to design and implement agricultural policy; and fifth, people in assistance agencies, national organizations and in rural areas are the key to successful development assistance. These lessons all point to the need for countries to build their own capabilities to conduct agricultural research, establish policies, and design the institutions necessary for a dynamic agricultural sector to meet current and future needs. The conclusions question whether today's foundations, which have very few staff stationed in sub-Sahara Africa, will be able to achieve the depth and nuanced understanding of local actors and institutions to apply their resources optimally. Can they identify national actors who truly have the will to remake policies to ensure agricultural development? Are enough resources being devoted to educate the people needed to create and adapt agricultural technology for today and the future? Do the organizations which are receiving more than 90% of the foundations' funds have the incentive to create national capacity and work themselves out of a job? (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

When respondents were asked to think about, argue, and 'choose' between the two, two-thirds of the respondents expressed a preference for food. Rather than the choice made by respondents, the focus here is on understanding the reasons behind their choice, as explained by beneficiaries themselves. Two main findings emerge. First, some arguments corroborate existing theory (e.g., paternalism, fungibility), but others (e.g., self-control, transition costs) are not incorporated in existing theory on the advantages of in-kind transfers. Second, context is important. Most importantly, respondents' reported preferences were associated with the benefits they were experiencing under the status quo: where the PDS performed better at distributing food, respondents were more likely to report preferring food to cash transfers. The contention of traditional theory that cash is superior fails to factor in contextual concerns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many of these initiatives fail when the public component of the program ends. One exception is the USDA Market Assistance Program (MAP) that facilitated the redevelopment of the Armenian dairy sector after privatization. This paper presents a case study of this initiative and hypothesize that the USDA MAP facilitated farmer investment in private enforcement capital. This investment resulted in sustainable market relationships between farmers and dairy processors even after the USDA MAP expired. We find empirical evidence to support this hypothesis using a panel dataset collected from 172 Armenian dairy farmers in 2004 and 2009. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using propensity score matching combined with a Stochastic Production Frontier model that corrects for sample selection bias, we disaggregate the yield growth attributable to the program into technological change (TC) and technical efficiency (TE). While the results do not exhibit a clear indication of selection bias, the analysis does show that on average beneficiaries exhibit higher yields than control farmers given the same input levels, but lower TE with respect to their own frontiers. These results suggest that while the program raised the technology gap in favor of beneficiaries, it had a negative effect on TE in the short run. The latter finding is consistent with the notion that beneficiaries enjoyed a significant change in production techniques, but it is very likely that they were still in the learning by doing stages at the time the data was collected. In fact, the results suggest a fast recovery in TE levels on the part of beneficiaries as time with project increased. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare food expenditure patterns in high and low-income households comparing those where Supplementary Nutrition Assistance (SNAP) is received in the first 10 days of the month versus households which receive SNAP over the first 15 days of the month. We find that food expenditure patterns vary systematically across the month within different retail channels by income and SNAP payment schedules. Low-income households in early SNAP distribution areas decrease their grocery and mass/club/superstore expenditures at the end of the calendar month and supplement this decrease with increased food expenditures in convenience stores and food away from home.

Drawing on cosmopolitan social theory, the experiences of counter-movements and concerns over food policy, the authors explore how mass pesticide poisoning and obesity can be viewed as the product of the 'success' of the modernization policy as well as a specific range of global phenomena configuring civic activity and policy situations. Through the study of NCDs as an emergent social field, the authors examine historical developments and heterogeneity in peoples' practices for insights on more practical and effective public policy responses. The rise of the consumer-citizen in counter-movements represents a paradoxical, but promising dynamic capable of reconstituting economies, culture, and society. In Ecuador, social action appears to be a largely neglected and under-utilized resource for tackling NCDs and perhaps other highly pressing and seemingly intractable food policy concerns.

Woman-children sub-units in monogamous households were less food insecure - and more at risk of becoming food insecure when the household became food insecure - than sub-units headed by women with first or second rank in polygamous households. Within polygamous households, woman-children sub-units headed by women with rank third or more were more likely to become food insecure when the household became food insecure than those with first or second rank. These results have implications for design, planning, and evaluation of programs and projects aiming to alleviate food insecurity in this and similar settings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These footprints trace the losses of reactive nitrogen (Nr), i.e. N compounds that are generally accessible to biota, in connection to the chain of food production and consumption. While necessary for food production, Nr is known for its negative environmental impacts. The N footprints presented here describe Nr losses but do not link to effects directly. In deriving N footprints, Nr lost along the production chain needs to be quantified, expressed as virtual nitrogen factors (VNF). We calculated specific VNF for Austrian production conditions for a set of eight broad food categories (poultry, pork, beef, milk, vegetables & fruit, potatoes, legumes, cereals). The life-cycle oriented nitrogen footprints for the respective food groups were replenished by assessing Nr losses related to energy needs and to food consumption. The results demonstrate that in general, animal based products are less nitrogen-efficient than plant based products. For meat, footprints range from 64 g N per kg (pork) to 134 g N per kg (beef). For vegetable products, footprints are between 5 g N per kg (potatoes) and 22 g N per kg (legumes). The detailed ranking of food products is different when relating nitrogen footprints to either simple mass of food, or protein content. Vegetables 82 fruit cause only 9 g N per kg, but 740 g N per kg protein, which is even higher than pork (616 g N per kg protein) or poultry (449 g N per kg protein). These differences clearly show that taking into account protein and other aspects of food quality may be crucial for a proper assessment of dietary choices. The total N footprint per Austrian inhabitant is dominated by food production and consumption (85%) but also includes other activities linked to fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere (notably combustion). The average N footprint is 19.8 kg N per year per Austrian inhabitant, which is on the lower end of a range of industrialized countries. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

What that requires is analogous to the green revolution in Asia. Several features differentiate the African situation. Those include greater diversity in cropping pattern including a historically larger and more widespread tropical commodity export sector. The physical infrastructure in rural Africa is far inferior to that of most Asian countries. While the greater diversity of agriculture calls for a larger and more diverse institutional structure the reality is that the research systems, the ancillary education systems to spread innovation and the rural financial systems are generally greatly inferior to those of Asia at the beginning of the green revolution. Ethiopia's record of a steady six to seven percent growth for agriculture and nearly halving of rural poverty demonstrates that with the right policies and investments a very poor country starting with poor physical and institutional infrastructure can bring a major contribution from agriculture growth to increased GDP and reduced poverty. As in Asia, the bulk of accelerated agricultural growth will come from small commercial farmers. They have sufficient farm income to reach or exceed the poverty level. Those are farms with, depending on the country, as little as 0.75 hectares to a few tens of hectares of land. They comprise up to half the rural population and produce on the order of 70-80 percent of agricultural output. They are in general not poor. The poor have inadequate land to reach the poverty level, initially with much underemployment, and with substantial non-farm employment. The primary driver of poverty reduction is the small commercial farmer spending on the order of half of increased income on nontradable, employment intensive goods and services from the rural non-farm sector.

However, the transition has not been without impacts on the overall agricultural RD&E agri-food capacity of the nation, and there are now indications of reduced capacity and slowing productivity gains in certain sectors. If not addressed, there is the risk that the future resilience of industries could be threatened, affecting parts of the Australian economy and compromising Australian contributions to global food supply on export markets and a slowing of agricultural innovation. There are also comparable divestment trends and the loss of capacity and risks to future resilience of agricultural systems in other developed nations. Importantly, research and extension are discussed as interdependent partner disciplines, and that the separation of the two has deleterious effects on capacity and resilience building. The authors investigate, through six case study institutions, organisational innovations that may provide direction towards the future restructuring of agricultural RD&E effort in Australia. These insights have application to both the Australian and the international reader, warning about the consequences of reduced investment in agricultural RD&E, and learning about how research and extension can transition from traditional public sector models to systems that have greater flexibility and, importantly, ownership by the industries themselves.

The export boom has caused a dramatic increase in female off-farm wage employment, which led to increased female bargaining power in the household. We investigate the causal effect of female wage income on primary school enrolment. We develop a collective household model with endogenous bargaining power to show that, if women have higher preferences for schooling than men, the impact of female wage income on school enrolment will be the result of a positive income effect, a negative labour substitution effect and a positive empowerment effect. We address the question empirically using original household survey data from Senegal. We use different econometric techniques and show that female off-farm wage income has a positive effect on primary school enrolment for both boys and girls, and that female empowerment is specifically important for the schooling of girls. Our results imply that the horticultural export boom in Senegal has indirectly contributed to the second and third Millennium Development Goals of universal primary education and elimination of gender disparities in primary education.

For the argument to hold any weight, price transmission between exporting countries' domestic and export markets should be unidirectional whereby export prices are driven by domestic prices but domestic prices are not affected by export prices. The study tests the hypothesis on Thailand, traditionally the world's largest rice exporter. The results from the causality tests are not entirely clear, however the results from the impulse response functions show that while the shocks originating in the domestic market are higher in magnitude in the export market in the short-run, the shocks originating in the export market are more persistent in the domestic market. This suggests that although Thailand's domestic policies are somewhat effective in the immediate months after the shock they allow price transmission from its export market to transfer over to its domestic market in the long-run. The results therefore imply that Thailand's domestic pricing programs are not heavily distorting world rice markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis finds evidence of an improvement in the height-for-age z-scores, but a worsening in weight-for-height z-scores for children aged 0-3 over the period 1998/1999-2005/2006. There is also evidence of a sharp decline in per adult equivalent calorie intake from the principal food items over roughly this same period. Moreover, this decline was observed across all the expenditure quintiles.

New supermarket procurement systems could affect farming patterns and wider rural development. While previous studies have analyzed farm productivity and income effects, possible employment effects have received much less attention. Special supermarket requirements may entail intensified farm production and post-harvest handling, thus potentially increasing demand for hired labor. This could also have important gender implications, because female and male workers are often hired for distinct farm operations. Building on data from a recent survey of vegetable farmers in Kenya, a double-hurdle model of hired labor use is developed and estimated. Farmer participation in supermarket channels increases the likelihood of hiring labor by 20%, and demand for hired labor by 61%. A gender disaggregation shows that positive employment effects are especially pronounced for female laborers, who often belong to the most vulnerable population groups. Rural employment generation can be an important vehicle for poverty reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Rao, Elizaphan J.

Using a split-sample willingness to pay survey, we find that individuals exhibit a higher willingness to pay for improved food safety standards in restaurants when acting as voting citizens than as buying consumers. Relying on consumer studies that focus on the buying context may therefore underestimate the support found among the public for new food regulations. This finding is important for policy makers using consumer studies in decision support and for researchers attempting to understand individual preferences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

MCASs maintain their legitimacy through the use of scientific norms and practices, as well as multiple tiers of oversight. The purported outcome is standardized conformity-assessment practices, and thus, standardized food and production practices regardless of location or producer. This article examines the ability of MCASs to enforce one form of zero tolerance standards: organics (i.e., zero-synthetic chemicals). The focus is on the governance of organic standards in the rural Indonesia, where the idea of zero tolerance is historically foreign. Drawing on a case study of an organic shrimp project in Indonesia, the ways that the social, economic, and cultural conditions of the global South affect the operations of a MCAS and the capacity of the MCAS to adapt to such conditions are examined. My findings raise questions as to the capability of MCASs to ensure standardized food governance globally. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These examples share several common features. First, the risk reduction is generally quantified as the fold reduction, i.e., risk reduction by twofold, 10-fold, etc., as no other convenient parameters are available. Second, there are situations where zero virtually does not exist, such as in the case of toxicants in GM plants or of radionuclides, because the background always exists. Third, assuring zero is often impossible on technological and other reasons. This shows the critical importance of understanding and communicating zero in terms of food policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Data was collected by means of an online survey implemented in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Poland, with a total sample size of 4408 respondents. Respondents expressed medium high to high levels of concern with sustainability issues at the general level, but lower levels of concern in the context of concrete food product choices. Understanding of the concept of sustainability was limited, but understanding of four selected labels (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, Carbon Footprint, and Animal Welfare) was better, as some of them seem to be self-explanatory. The results indicated a low level of use, no matter whether use was measured as self-reported use of different types of information available on food labels or as use inferred from the results of a choice-based conjoint analysis. Hierarchical regression indicated that use is related to both motivation and understanding, and that both motivation, understanding and use are affected by demographic characteristics, human values as measured by the Schwartz value domains, and country differences. The results imply that sustainability labels currently do not play a major role in consumers' food choices, and future use of these labels will depend on the extent to which consumers' general concern about sustainability can be turned into actual behaviour.

Empirical evidence from primary schools in Germany",FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,School milk; Demand model; Multilevel analysis; Context effects; Price experiment; Policy impact,MULTILEVEL MODELS,"Despite the subsidies provided for school milk within the European School Milk Scheme, consumption has declined steadily in Germany. Thus, a federal research project was established to analyze factors that influence the demand for school milk. The results should form a basis to improve future school milk policy. To identify the factors affecting the decisions by individual pupils to order school milk and to quantify the impact of each factor, politically induced factors, individual and context factors were considered. Price effects and the associated policy issues were derived via a price experiment in selected German primary schools, while information on weekly orders for school milk was collected at the individual level. Detailed information on the eating habits, preferences and tastes, attitudes, socio-economic circumstances and characteristics of the persons involved was obtained by administering various surveys. The respondents examined in the study included pupils, the pupils' parents, class teachers, school milk managers (primarily janitors) and school principals. To properly account for the hierarchical structure of the dataset (pupils within classes and schools along the different price steps of the experiment), a logistic multilevel analysis was applied based on 7336 pupils from 101 schools. The free-of-charge distribution of school milk had a high positive impact in the demand decision, confirming the importance of the policy setting (e.g., availability of subsidies). Although the price had an expected negative effect, its impact is limited. In addition to socio-economic factors (e.g., age, gender, immigration background and income of households), the behavior and attitudes of pupils and parents, as well as the context or environment surrounding the school milk offering (e.g., number of school milk products, whether teachers drink milk with the pupils during the break) had an impact.

One crucial outcome is the limited ability to carry out trade, which brings about welfare losses. Conflict-induced policies such as security measures can result in sizable unintended externalities that shape the markets of and the trade in food. We assess the dynamics of daily wholesale prices of food produced in Israel and the West Bank that is traded between them and is therefore subject to restrictions on movement. To do so, we suggest a regime switching cointegration model which is estimated using a novel extension of the Johansen estimation method. We find that the two major wholesale markets of the two regions are integrated with regard to these main trading products. Deviations from price equilibria are quickly adjusted. The model suggests that movement restrictions temporarily cut off markets from each other. Implications of conflict-induced closures for welfare depend on the direction of trade and are harming both Palestinian and Israeli consumers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It covers positive and negative impacts of food on health, as well as issues related to under and over consumption of food. The European Union-funded study FAHRE (Food and Health Research in Europe) has described structures and identified gaps and needs for food and health research across Europe. Methods: FAHRE was conducted by a consortium of partners in 7 European countries, including private and public research organisations, university-based researchers and civil society organisations. National advisers in 32 European countries made reports on the structures of food and health research, and nine experts made reports on food and health research themes. At the end of this phase, a stakeholder conference was held to review and discuss the findings, and from this a Strategic Document was developed and distributed electronically for wider consultation at national level. This report presents the findings of the Strategic Document. Results: FAHRE proposed that future research using public funding should address the global issue of unhealthy eating, including obesity, which causes preventable disability and disease, reduced working life and increased healthcare costs. FAHRE suggests a move of the focus of research from healthy food to healthy eating, and to overcome the existing separation between food research and health research through a shift of research towards food for health. EU member states have widely differing national systems for research management, and information is poorly standardised for comparisons. There are many research programmes in both food and health, usually managed by ministries of science, but rarely in collaboration with ministries of health. Industry mainly contributes 'near product' research: few industry small and medium enterprises are engaged with food and health research, nor are civil society organisations. EU food and health research has been focused within the agriculture research theme, and not sufficiently linked to health research. FAHRE recommends coordination of food and health research through an EU-level Coordinating Agency, with budget and representation from the three EU directorates Agriculture, Health and Research, the member states, and wider stakeholders including civil society and industry. There should be corresponding 'food and health research agencies' in the member states bringing together national policy-makers and stakeholders, and directing research funding. Food safety agencies may provide a model for this joint approach. Further proposals include strengthening social and policy research, accessing Structural Funds for research programmes, and more strategic approaches to determining research programmes and funding. Conclusion: Food and health research in Europe should move from 'healthy food', which concentrates on food as a product, to research for 'healthy eating' which is concerned with appropriate intake and reducing disease. Coordination of research on this theme, at European level, and between member states, could deliver major economic and social returns. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A comment,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food waste; Greenhouse gas emissions; Landfill; Methane; Waste management,SOLID-WASTE MANAGEMENT; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,"In a recent paper Garnett (2011) examines the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the global food system. This paper builds on Garnett's contribution by considering how high levels of food waste contribute to the food chain's greenhouse emissions and how they can be reduced, something Garnett generally overlooks. The emissions that arise from food waste represent the emissions embedded in the production of food that is then wasted and the emissions that arise from the process of waste disposal. Food waste can also be split into pre-consumer and consumer waste. These distinctions give rise to four categories of food waste related emissions: pre-consumer embedded, pre-consumer waste disposal, consumer embedded and consumer waste disposal emissions. The levels of food waste in each category differ between economies, as do the causes of wastage. Policies to address food waste and the associated emissions need to promote a mixture of technological and behavioural change and be tailored to the economic, cultural and technological conditions in each country.

These persistent problems provide a strong theoretical justification for the development of commodity exchanges. However, the majority of African commodity exchanges remain underdeveloped. Through a case study of the Zambian Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ZAMACE), this article explores why agricultural commodity exchanges in the region have thus far failed to develop into sustainable trading platforms and identifies the most important changes needed to enhance their performance. Drawing on interviews and group discussions with the primary participants on ZAMACE, five main factors that impede volumes traded on the ZAMACE exchange are identified and analyzed: (1) the limited success in attracting financial institutions' commitment to commodity exchanges; (2) the anonymous nature of trading on a commodity exchange exacerbates the risks associated with contract non-compliance and opportunistic behavior; (3) the potential for conflict of interest among brokers; (4) the potential for market manipulation in a thinly traded market; and (5) the high fixed costs that are imposed on actors trading in a thin market. Exacerbating all these factors is the unpredictability of government intervention in cereal markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little analysis is available to suggest how social welfare would be affected by consumer and industry responses to these new vaccines. To address this void, we use stated-preference data to estimate consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for food safety vaccines and then simulate the welfare impacts of subsidizing consumer purchases of the vaccine given two different industry responses: maintaining current levels of food safety vigilance and reducing food safety vigilance due to a moral hazard response that undermines consumer confidence in food safety. To obtain consumer preferences for the vaccine, we simultaneously estimate a three-equation model that recognizes the recursive nature of responses to questions probing respondents' willingness to purchase vaccines and perceptions of the probability and severity of possible foodborne illness incidents and the joint distribution of unobservable components.

The results show the presence of inefficiency, with about 74% of the variation in actual profit from maximum profit (profit frontier) between farms mainly arising from differences in farmers' practices rather than random variability. Further the mean profit efficiency level of 0.58 suggests that there is a substantial scope to improve beef profitability in Botswana. Significant profit efficiency drivers include, among others, education, distance to market, herd size, access to information and access to income from crop production. Considering the importance of livestock sector for wealth creation and poverty eradication in the rural areas where poverty is more pronounced, there is a need for appropriate development strategies and policies directed towards addressing these factors. In particular there is need to invest in market infrastructure in order to improve market access, hence profit efficiency of smallholder livestock farmers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the consequences of population growth in a general equilibrium setting, we examine the dynamics of population density and its impacts on household outcomes using panel data from Indonesia, combined with district-level demographic data. Historically, Indonesia has adapted to land constraints through a mix of agricultural intensification, expansion of the land frontier, and nonfarm diversification, with public policies playing a role in catalyzing all of these responses. In contemporary Indonesia we find that human capital determines the effect of increased population density on per capita household consumption expenditure. The effect of population density is positive if the average educational attainment is high (above junior high school), while it is negative otherwise. On the other hand, farmers with larger holdings maintain their advantage in farming regardless of population density. The paper concludes with some potential lessons for African countries from Indonesia's more successful rural development experiences.

In every case, it has opted to defer the decision. In the absence of such thresholds, current European labeling laws require that seeds be labeled as GM if they contain any detectable trace of GMOs approved for cultivation in the EU. Conventional seeds with detectable traces of GMOs that have not been authorized for cultivation cannot be sold in the European market altogether. As the acreage of GM crops has continued to grow at a fast pace around the world, industry calls to the EU Commission for setting practical adventitious presence (AP) thresholds for conventional seeds in the EU have multiplied. In this paper, we examine the economics of alternative AP thresholds for conventional seeds in Europe from the perspective of those who must comply with the regulation - EU seed firms. Specifically, we first examine the operational changes that might be necessary for seed firms to comply with alternative AP thresholds for conventional seeds. Then, we analyze the associated market uncertainties, compliance costs and their implications on firm and industry competitiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial mappings of the raw data reveal large variations in levels of food insecurity and conflict across the country; surprisingly, high conflict provinces are not the most food insecure. Using a simple bivariate regression model of conflict (violent incidents and persons killed or injured) on food security (calorie intake and the real value of food consumed), we find mixed associations. But once we move to a multivariate framework, accounting for household characteristics and key commodity prices, we find robust evidence that in Afghanistan levels of conflict and food security are negatively correlated. We also find that households in provinces with higher levels of conflict experience muted declines in food security due to staple food price increases relative tohouseholds in provinces with lower levels of conflict, perhaps because the former are more disconnected from markets. Gaining a better understanding of linkages between conflict and food insecurity and knowing their spatial distributions can serve to inform policymakers interested in targeting scarce resources to vulnerable populations, for example, through the placement of strategic grain reserves or targeted food assistance programs.

Perhaps no country was more affected by these disruptions than Bangladesh. Our analysis shows that prior to the 2007 crisis, when Bangladesh imported an average of nearly 1 million tons of rice per year from India, domestic wholesale prices of rice in Bangladesh were co-integrated with import parity prices of subsidized Below Poverty Line (BPL) rice. When in mid-2007, India sharply curtailed exports, rice prices surged in Bangladesh. Model simulations show that a relatively small increase in private consumer stocks equivalent to about 2 weeks of normal consumption could account for the large surge in domestic prices in Bangladesh and that an additional 300,000 tons (in addition to approximately 700,000 tons of net rice distribution that actually occurred) would have been sufficient to stabilize prices in the November 2007-April 2008 period. The Bangladesh analysis thus shows that in spite of the uncertainty in international markets, careful planning, timely interventions and openness to trade can substantially reduce requirements for public stockholding.

A mail survey was conducted among a random sample of men and women aged between 38 and 79 years; 1095 usable questionnaires were obtained. Multi-group structural equation modelling was used to examine the relationships between the variables among men and women. Findings suggest that food safety concerns played central roles in the relationships between demographics, body weight, personal values and dietary and physical activity habits for both men and women. However, there were significant differences between the genders in the ways the food safety concerns impacted these relationships. For example, body weight was negatively related to women's physical activity behaviours but not men's; the concerns were associated with dining out habits among women but not men; age influenced women's concerns and physical activity but not those of men. Therefore, men and women's dietary and physical activity habits were impacted directly by personal background characteristics, body weight, and personal values, and indirectly through food safety concerns. The implications of the study are that for food policy makers, a gendered focus on food safety concerns, and other relatively malleable variables such as personal values, may be more likely to change dietary and physical activity habits in the short term than a focus on more stable socio-demographic characteristics.

This paper provides a conceptual overview of the range of data and analyses that will permit leaders and analysts serving them to assess the broad implications of higher global food prices for a country and its population groups. What we find is that there are a relatively small number of types of policy responses that governments might take in the face of a food price rise. Consequently, relatively well-defined sets of data need to be compiled and types of analyses used by government to generate the information needed to broadly guide efforts to prevent food price increases from becoming crises and to derive any possible benefits. International joint action can be employed profitably both to collect this data and to build national capacity to conduct the analyses needed to guide policy formulation and general program design in the face of the risks and the opportunities of higher food prices and to evaluate the effectiveness of those policy responses.

Our analysis was focused only on land requirement and carbon footprints. In a general conclusion it can be said that the carbon footprint of the most climate-friendly protein sources is up to 100 times smaller than those of the most climate-unfriendly. The differences between footprints of the various products were found mainly to be due to differences in production systems. The outcomes for pork and poultry show much more homogeneity than for beef and seafood. This is largely because both beef and seafood production show a wide variety of production systems. Land use (occupation), comprising both arable land and grasslands, also varies strongly, ranging from negligible for seafood to up to 2100 m(2) y kg(-1) of protein from extensive cattle farming. From farm to fork the feed production and animal husbandry are by far the most important contributors to the environmental impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

China's hog industry is facing challenges which might restrict long-term growth in production. This paper analyzes the changes in regional scale, organization, input factors, and technological progress for China's hog production over the last few decades. The paper seeks to reveal the sources of hog production growth and provide some suggestions for future development of the hog industry. To achieve these aims, the paper uses stochastic frontier production functions and the Malmquist index to measure total factor productivity (TFP) in the hog industry and decompose TFP into technical efficiency; technological progress; scale efficiency; and allocative efficiency using data for 25 provinces from 1980 to 2008. The results show firstly that; the TFP of hog production increased by 64.3% from 1980 to 2008, and allocative efficiency and scale efficiency improvements played a key role in this TFP growth. In contrast, technical efficiency and technical progress have changed little over this period. Secondly, TFP's contribution to output was 39.7%, it being less than that of factor inputs to output. Thirdly, the results suggest that the growth of China's pork production depends mostly on the increase in the quantity of factor inputs, especially feed. As a consequence, the key to ensuring long-term and stable development of China's hog production would seem to involve focusing on enhancing total factor productivity and changing the pattern of production growth.

If farmers are slow to adjust to their declining competitiveness, for example by obtaining off-farm employment, the farm-nonfarm household income gap may increase. A decline in food self-sufficiency may be perceived as undermining national food security, and a persistent farm-nonfarm income gap as contributing to social unrest. In these circumstances, what offsetting or compensating policy options should the government consider for ensuring adequate long-term food security and less income inequality? This paper evaluates China's historical record since 1980 and then projects China's economy to 2030, using the GTAP global economy-wide model. It draws on past policy experiences of both China and other economies to evaluate prospective interventions by government to address food security and income inequality concerns. The potential effects of some of those are estimated for 2030, again using the GTAP model. The paper concludes by suggesting alternative ways to achieve the fundamental objectives of national food security and less rural-urban income inequality, namely via generic social safety nets and improved rural infrastructure.

In reality, the cost of accessing variety may not be zero. In this paper we study the effect of variety access cost on the consumption of food variety and its role in explaining regional differences in dietary diversity in China. We find that a higher cost of access negatively affects the individual's ability to diversify her diet in terms of both the total counts and the balancing of varieties consumed. The primary policy implication of this research is that attempts to create a healthy food environment in China must be differentiated along rural and urban lines. In rural communities where consumers have been limited in their ability to diversify food baskets by high electricity and transportation costs, infrastructure development and modernization may effectively improve nutritional balance. For more urbanized communities where the cost of consuming additional food variety is relatively low, food policies might instead focus on interventions that promote healthy eating to mitigate the burden of over-nutrition.

The media's negative portrayal of LFTB as an unnecessary and unsavory additive to ground beef products corresponded with a spike in reports over a 6-month period. Since LFTB is often used in ground beef, it is likely that consumption of LFTB-based ground beef products and other meats could be affected. This paper used weekly meat production and sales data to assess how media depictions of LFTB affect consumer demand. We used a Central Bureau of Statistics model to test whether media portrayal affects the consumption of aggregate meats and beef cuts: pork, chicken, turkey, Choice beef, Prime beef, Select beef and ground beef. Results indicate that media portrayal of LFTB, measured by the number of articles on the subject weighted by consumer readership, did not lead to significant changes in consumer demand across meats or within the beef category immediately. However, consumer purchases of pork, turkey and Prime beef were affected two weeks or greater after news reports of LFTB surfaced. Nevertheless, those effects were temporary and waned or disappeared during later weeks. Our look at the LFTB controversy informs food policy by studying the media sources from which consumers obtain their information. As the temporary effects of news media on consumer demand for aggregate meats and disaggregate beef cuts suggest, consumers may benefit from receiving their news from industry and government sources instead.

We find that quality wines produced in specified regions (QWPSR) are associated with higher exports values, while higher export volumes tend to materialize only towards high-income destination markets. Besides, the geographical designation appears increasing the extensive margin of trade. Therefore, QWPSR may represent a strategic tool for differentiation granting competitiveness in both traditional and less habitual markets. Not all producers, yet, seem to have benefited to the same extent from the geographical designation, raising the question of what harmonizing and/or promotional strategy should be adopted to enhance the effectiveness of the quality wine protection system.

These changes have had a significant impact on cotton yields and output in India, but less so for rice and wheat-the country's main cereal staples-for which yield growth rates are tending toward stagnation. This analysis examines the structures of these industries, their potential effects on competition and innovation, and the policies that may improve both industry performance and the delivery of new productivity-enhancing technologies to India's cereal production systems. Our findings suggest that more substantive policy reforms are needed to encourage further innovation, reduce regulatory uncertainty, and encourage firm- and industry-level growth, while continued public spending on agricultural research is needed to support technological change.

In contrast, we assembled papers that focus on zero tolerance as a characteristic of an increasing number of public and private rules that govern and shape the agrifood system. The contributions to this section illustrate the importance of an interdisciplinary approach for the conceptualization and exploration of zero tolerance rules, as well as an examination of the impact of zero on a range of value chain stakeholders including consumers. A thread running through the articles is that a society's culture, and the political economy in which it is embedded, matter. Moreover, the authors show that the meaning of zero is ambiguous and application of zero is problematic at best. Perhaps most important is the argument that absolute safety is simply an illusion.

Elites, including government officials and those members of scientific communities who support the science-based risk analysis approach, have become responsible for communicating seemingly contradictory ideas such as food in Japan is safe and there is no such thing as zero risk with food. This communication logjam has resulted in confusion and created public distrust of both government and scientific experts. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to examine the struggles and challenges faced by government officials in explaining and practicing policies that pertain to highly controversial food safety issues. The primary data used for illuminating the discourses is the official minutes of governmental committees including the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Committee and the Consumer Commission.

Data on livelihood assets were collected from 292 households, which were clustered to test how differences in outcomes (asset building) reflect variations in initial asset endowments. The results suggest that most households built particular elements of their asset base and increased their resilience to future shocks. However, households struggled to make effective use of the gains for intensifying their livelihoods. Of the least-endowed households, few made investments in the scale or productivity of coffee, and most continued to depend heavily on subsistence production and seasonal off-farm income for survival. In conclusion, improved market access alone, even under relatively favorable market conditions and with considerable external support, will have uncertain impacts on rural poverty if the underlying constraints on household assets and investments are not addressed concurrently.

This study uses an agricultural commodity trade exposure index in a cross-sectional analysis of more than 70,000 farms to study the relationship between the trade exposure of agricultural commodities and the yields reported by these farms in the 1997 Chilean agricultural census. In order to capture both import and export exposure we subdivide farms in two groups, according to the Chilean case: farms producing only importables such as grains (traditional crops), and farms producing both traditional crops and non-traditional agricultural commodities (products more related to export markets). We exclude from our analysis farms producing only non-traditional products because the census only reports yields for traditional crops. We employ a switching regression model to analyze the effects of trade exposure on traditional crop yields for both groups of farms. Results show that the trade exposure index is positively related to farm yields for both groups, but with a larger effect on farmers producing both traditional and non-traditional commodities. These results are important because they suggest that spillovers from both importables and exportables produce gains in the productivity of traditional crops. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we quantify the potential dynamic impacts of such a disease on Brittany, a French region with an important livestock sector. In order to do this, we develop a dynamic computable general equilibrium model that allows us to measure the impacts on the livestock sectors and downstream food industries. We study the impacts of a FMD outbreak including the culling infected animals, a temporary decline in demand, and restrictions on movements of live animals and meats during the FMD outbreak period. Our results show that economic losses following this disease are spread over many periods even with a one-time shock. We also find that the impacts on the various primary sectors and downstream food sectors are quite different, depending on their initial trade position. Our general equilibrium results show the great incidence of potential constraints affecting factor markets. Capital and wage constraints severely increase the aggregate costs of such disease. These results challenge the definition of a simple efficient management policy for this disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Foucault-based genealogical analysis of discursive formations, the paper traces the last 20 years of institutions' biofuel debate in relation to rural production. We find that the prevalent motive is an aspiration to combine the agriculture and energy markets into one, which prompts structural changes and challenges in the rural sector. This has implications for the future role and shape of global agriculture and - contrary to the food vs. fuel perspective - calls for re-conceptualizing the biofuel debate as the food vs. food dilemma.

J,"Jensen, JD; Smed, S",,,,"Jensen, Jorgen Dejgard; Smed, Sinne",,,"The Danish tax on saturated fat - Short run effects on consumption, substitution patterns and consumer prices of fats",FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fat tax; Demand response; Price response; Retail sales,,"Denmark introduced a tax on saturated fat in food products with effect from October 2011. The objective of this paper is to make an effect assessment of this tax for some of the product categories most significantly affected by the new tax, namely fats such as butter, butter-blends, margarine and oils. This assessment is done by conducting an econometric analysis on weekly food purchase data from a large household panel dataset (GfK Panel Services Denmark), spanning the period from January 2008 until July 2012. The econometric analysis suggest that the introduction of the tax on saturated fat in food products has had some effects on the market for the considered products, in that the level of consumption of fats dropped by 10-15%. Furthermore, the analysis points at shifts in demand from high price supermarkets towards low-price discount stores - at least for some types of oils and fats, a shift that seems to have been utilised by discount chains to raise the prices of butter and margarine by more than the pure tax increase. Due to the relatively short data period with the tax being active, interpretation of these findings from a long-run perspective should be done with considerable care. It is thus recommended to repeat - and broaden - the analysis at a later stage, when data are available for a longer period after the introduction of the fat tax. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The reverse is more apparent than ever as greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are tallied. The development and effective diffusion of new agricultural practices and technologies will largely shape how and how well farmers mitigate and adapt to climate change. This adaptation and mitigation potential is nowhere more pronounced than in developing countries where agricultural productivity remains low; poverty, vulnerability and food insecurity remain high; and the direct effects of climate change are expected to be especially harsh. Creating the necessary agricultural technologies and harnessing them to enable developing countries to adapt their agricultural systems to changing climate will require innovations in policy and institutions as well. Potential constraints to innovation involve both the private and public sectors in both developing and developed countries. The process of transferring agricultural innovations across agroecological and climatic zones is often subject to agronomic constraints. Often, the most binding constraints occur at the adoption stage, with several factors that potentially impede poor farmers' access to and use of new technologies. Based on discussions of these constraints, we derive six policy principles and use these principles to suggest several specific investments and policy priorities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis of small-scale irrigation expansion shows that the potential for investment in small-scale projects in Kenya ranges from 54,000 ha to 241,000 hectares, with an internal rate of return from 17% to 32%. For the dam-based investment analysis, under low-cost assumption, 58 dams of 73 are profitable (IRR > 0). At high cost level, the number is 52. If we raise the IRR cutoff value to 12%, 32 dams are economically feasible.

However, country of origin labelling (CoOL) is one of the few divergences in these trans-Tasman food regulations. Australia has mandatory CoOL on many food products, while New Zealand does not. This difference raises questions regarding the most influential inputs into the policy process determining CoOL regulations. For policy advocates, this raises further questions of how to influence the decision-making process most effectively. Therefore, this research aims (1) to determine which factors of the policy process best explain the differing CoOL regulations in Australia and New Zealand and (2) to highlight aspects of the policy process that aid or impede the influence of policy advocates. To address these objectives, interviews were conducted among key stakeholders and relevant documents were analysed. The current findings reveal that an understanding of the policy networks in each country is necessary, but recognising the role of interests, ideas and institutions helps construct a comprehensive explanation of CoOL regulations. The characteristics of different network types are discussed as constraints or opportunities for promoting a group's position. Particularly, the structure of policy networks can help shape the way in which policy actors construct their argument and the audiences to whom this argument is directed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using comparative case study analysis, this article examines support initiatives for dairy sector innovation in The Netherlands and Australia, addressing common challenges such as environmental issues, cattle health, new technology, and human resources. To this end, a review was conducted of documented information and articles published on the initiatives. The qualitative analysis focused on how the co-production process was supported and the achievements and challenges associated with each case. Across both countries and between different initiatives, the main achievements were found to be the generation of very different ideas addressing dairy sector challenges and attempting to bridge public and private sector interests. The main challenges included maintaining effort and momentum for high ambition targets and the potential for duplication as stakeholders became enrolled in different initiatives sponsored by different organizations in an increasingly devolved institutional setting. Furthermore, without strong institutional support for innovation co-production processes, individual actors were less able to operate effectively in innovation co-production roles. It is concluded that dairy sector innovation policies should address institutional constraints (e.g. provision of leadership and rewards for involvement in co-production processes), recognize that facilitation of innovation co-production needs to be adequately resourced, enhance support for initiative coordination to avoid duplication of effort, and take into account the specific institutional setting of countries and sectors to guide the design of innovation co-production support initiatives.

These food price shocks fomented violent civil responses in some countries, but not others, offering a unique opportunity to assess the factors that contributed to these disturbances. We explore this question empirically with specific reference to Africa, where food riots occurred in at least 14 countries. By examining the socio-economic and political conditions facing African countries, we attempt to answer why only some countries in Africa witnessed food riots in late 2007 and early 2008, while others did not. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that higher levels of poverty (as proxied by the Human Poverty Index), restricted access to and availability of food, urbanization, a coastal location, more oppressive regimes and stronger civil societies are associated with a higher likelihood of riots occurring. We also examine three country cases (Egypt, Mozambique, Niger) which represent different circumstances and responses to the food crisis, and identify specific factors that were associated with food protests in each case. Our study highlights the importance of pro-poor policies and investments and improved governance in addressing the problems facing the poor and in helping secure political stability. As the frequency and variability of natural disasters increase in response to climate change, such policies can serve to protect the poor from the debilitating consequences of the resulting shocks.

It investigates whether female-headed households are more likely to report experiencing a food price shock, and whether female-headed households experiencing a shock are more (or less) likely to adopt certain coping strategies, controlling for individual, household, and community characteristics. Our findings suggest that female-headed households are more vulnerable to food price changes and are more likely to have experienced a food price shock in 2007-2008. Because female-headed households are also resource poor and have a larger food gap compared with male-headed households, they cope by cutting back on the number of meals they provide their households during good months and eating less preferred foods in general. A combination of short-term measures to protect diet diversity and micronutrient consumption of vulnerable groups and longer-term measures to promote investment in sustainable agriculture, such as strengthening women's property rights, may increase the ability of poor and vulnerable households to cope better with food price increases.

These soils are, however, deficient in important nutrients and prone to degradation, requiring input-intensive processes that suggest a low level of productive efficiency. Employing a sequence of agricultural censuses and a biome approach for characterizing agricultural zones, the present study evaluates the Cerrado's total factor productivity growth and productive potential. The analysis highlights the resource cost of Brazil's Cerrado Miracle, the role of paved road infrastructure in expanding production opportunities, and the significant production gains that the Cerrado may yet achieve. Results suggest a substantial productivity gap between the Cerrado's most efficient and average producers, implying that Cerrado production might well be further boosted if average producers succeed in adopting the technologies and management practices of the more efficient operators. More generally, and to the extent the Cerrado model is generalizable elsewhere, agricultural development of the world's savannahs, such as Sub-Saharan Africa's Guinea regions, into breadbaskets will be expensive in terms of material inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, depending for their success therefore on the real prices of these inputs.

This has been shown by numerous studies using either discrete choice or hedonic approaches to derive implicit prices for origin as a product attribute. In most of the hedonic studies, intercept dummies were introduced for specific regional origins and statistically significant coefficients of those variables were seen as an indication of either a superior or inferior reputation, compared to products from other origins. We argue that hedonic pricing models of this type may be too simple to detect the true origin effects if assessments of a product's sensory quality are available and interact with prior beliefs about reputation. Based on a supply-and-demand framework to explain auction prices, a reduced-form hedonic pricing model is suggested that includes intercept- as well as slope-dummy effects of the regional origin. Because reputation and the objective product quality are particularly important for markets of differentiated, high-quality foods and beverages, we analyze electronic auction markets for specialty coffees. The findings for the Cup of Excellence data reveal that it is important to distinguish reputation, sensory quality, and their interaction as determinants of coffee auction prices, as well as varying origin impacts across market segments.

We randomly paired 138 subjects and recorded their decision to give or keep restaurant vouchers and their choice of restaurant. The majority (83.3%) chose an unhealthy restaurant if their randomly assigned partner chose an unhealthy restaurant. Similarly, 77.8% chose a healthy restaurant if their partner did (p = 0.005). The altruistic were more likely to choose a healthy restaurant (p = 0.017). In sum, restaurant choice is influenced by reciprocity. A cycle of projection, gifting and reciprocation may explain the social dynamics of food choice. We propose policies that capitalize on people's tendency towards altruism and imitation.

One possible reaction was moving to specialty markets, where price pressure was perceived to be lower. We use original survey data from 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 to analyze the factors influencing participation in specialty markets and to estimate separate production functions for specialty and conventional coffee farmers allowing for farm-specific inefficiencies. Applying a sample selection framework, we find significant selection bias in the sub-sample of specialty farmers and evidence for the overestimation of efficiency, if this bias is not adequately controlled for. Among the most important factors that influence farm-specific efficiency levels in the two sub-samples are the availability of additional income activities, experience in coffee cultivation, and membership in cooperatives. Based on the results, we derive policy recommendations to improve farmers' production performance and ability to cope with the effects of the coffee crisis. These policy measures include the provision of extension services with respect to farm management skills, the creation of income opportunities in rural areas, and the support of farmer-owned cooperatives.

Taxation of sugar could lead to a statistically significant reduction in both the incidence of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. The health effects appear to be most pronounced for low-income individuals, and the reforms may therefore reduce health inequality.

While we document evidence that the participatory model robustly promotes the adoption of crop management innovations across all research sites, we do not find significant effects for other domains of innovation. We also document considerable heterogeneity in terms of local priorities, and show that not all innovation platforms are equally successful. We present tentative evidence that the performance of these platforms depends on specific dimensions of ex ante social capital. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Only four countries, South Africa, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Egypt have commercialized GM crops in Africa but controversy surrounds current cultivation of GM maize in Egypt. Our study provides new perspectives on the status, development and regulation of GM crops through examining the views of 305 stakeholders in six African countries across four regions: South Africa, Kenya (East Africa), Egypt and Tunisia (North Africa), Ghana and Nigeria (West Africa), supplemented by interviews with relevant international organizations. The study revealed the challenges leading to the development of biosafety regulatory frameworks and the role of individual stakeholders in the facilitation of GM crops across African countries. This study also revealed that some countries may go through a Fiber-Feed-Food (F3) approach to adopt GM crops where Bt cotton will be adopted first followed by GM crops for livestock feed while undergoing all the necessary assessments before producing GM foods for human consumption. An overwhelming majority of stakeholders placed emphasis on risk analysis (risk assessment and management) in view of limited capacity, lack of scientific expertise and public concern, and encouraged a centralized approach to risk assessment similar to the European Union model of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

This paper represents a snapshot review of ongoing nutrition challenges, the contours of the post-MDG debate, and the views of 26 experts in nutrition and the MDGs. The paper draws out post 2015 options, develops criteria for ranking the options, applies the criteria and makes a recommendation. While a nutrition goal (the vertical option) that covers all countries and addresses both under and overweight and obesity may well be most effective for galvanizing commitment for nutrition and for guiding action, it does not seem politically feasible. A strong position for nutrition is to be located with hunger in a vertical goal with an additional horizontal goal which places nutrition-specific indicators alongside nutrition-relevant indicators in new goal buckets, with placement driven by the UNICEF conceptual framework for undernutrition. The minimalist option of simply replacing the flawed underweight indicator with the superior stunting indicator in the poverty goal will not galvanize any constituency and should be rejected.

Unobserved differences between borrowers and non-borrowers are controlled for in a dynamic fuzzy regression-discontinuity design creating a quasi-experimental environment for causal inference. Both anthropometric and micronutrient measures of child nutrition are investigated.

The main manipulation concerned the number and type of nutrition labels (directive-, semi-, and non-directive), chromaticity (monochrome vs. traffic light color-coded scheme); number and type of additional design elements; and the distance between the label and additional design elements. Attention was measured by performance in visual search task. Performance was slower with increasing number of additional design elements, and when the label appeared in a dense rather than non-dense area. These effects were modulated by label type and chromaticity. The results show that information density is a key factor for consumer attention to (nutrition) information.

This paper explores farmer preferences for particular contract design attributes. We combined analytical hierarchy process and discrete choice experiments to investigate the importance of contract design attributes. On the basis of data collected among potato farmers in Ethiopia, we found that input market uncertainty is more important than output market uncertainty in smallholders' decision to participate. Farmers tend to minimize their risk by opting for the buyer firm above the state and NGOs as providers of seed, inputs, and technical assistance. The results imply that the success of a CF scheme depends on the willingness of the firm to incorporate the preferred contract design attributes. Institutional intervention in the input market could induce agri-business firms to offer attractive contracts for smallholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The cooperative addressed in this study restricts the participation of small-scale farmers, implying that selection into the program must be taken into consideration for an accurate assessment of the treatment effect. The econometric analysis revealed that government extension services have a modest effect on farm income. In contrast, the treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is robust and substantially large, accounting for nearly 70% of the pre-matching difference. This suggests that the agricultural cooperative system is an important avenue for farmers to improve their economic status. The treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is highly heterogeneous; the economic benefits arising from the cooperative are significant only for small-scale farms. We can argue that a coexistence of smallholder exclusion and the treatment effect in favor of small-scale farms poses serious challenges to pro-poor agricultural growth in China.

Some authors establish a link between the reduction of distances traveled by food and lower energy consumption due to transportation, while others hold that local supply chains have a poor energy performance. This article engages this debate by comparing the rates of energy consumption attributable to different modes of distribution of fruits and vegetables in a region of France. By studying actors' actual practices, we show that the establishment of local food systems leads to organizational efforts at the local level or in the form of geographically centralized networks which allow energy expenditures linked to distribution to be minimized. The studied chains' performances are variable, from 13.5 to 44.8 GOE/sic (Gram of Oil Equivalent per euro) of product, bringing them close to long chains in the best examples. Comparison with other research underscores the diversity of methods which are put in place. They also show that energy performance remains very dependent on where the study was conducted. Ultimately this study invites us to better analyze the ways in which actors collaborate to optimize energy expenditures relative to the distribution of food products in local sales chains.

Our analysis shows that a 1% increase in crop output per hectare is associated with a 1.8% increase in pesticide use per hectare but that the growth in intensity of pesticide use levels off as countries reach a higher level of economic development. However, very few high income countries have managed to significantly reduce the level of intensity of their pesticide use, because decreases in insecticide use at higher income levels are largely offset by increases in herbicide and fungicide use. The results also show very rapid growth in the intensity of pesticide use for several middle income countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Cameroon, Malaysia and Thailand. Complementing our analysis with data from the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent (PIC), we show that hazardous pesticides covered in the PIC procedure are more weakly regulated in lower than in higher income countries. We discuss the policy challenges facing developing countries with a rapid growth in pesticide use and recommend a four-pronged strategy, including an environmental tax on pesticides with revenues allocated to long-term investments in awareness building, the development of integrated crop management methods and the setting of food safety standards. The interactions between these measures should help contribute to the effectiveness of the overall strategy package. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Regression results for the study area indicate that specific attributes of different maize varieties are an important influence on their use. The benefits to growing hybrid maize appear to be yield and drought tolerance. Open pollinated varieties are selected by farmers who value early maturity. Local maize varieties are popular among farm households owing to a number of favourable processing and consumption characteristics: storability, poundability, flour-to-grain ratio, and taste. Further research using nationally representative data is needed to assess whether findings for Mulanje District can be generalized to Malawi as a whole. If future studies agree with the results herein then maize breeding research programs in Malawi should consider a diversity of traits beyond grain yield to encompass the range of production, processing, and consumption attributes that are valued by farmers.

Substantial experience and information generated from a large number of household-level studies is not being utilised by macro- and aggregate models which fail to recognise heterogeneity, dynamics and fundamental drivers of change in livestock systems. Household-level studies are not standardised and rarely identify and characterise key drivers and mechanisms for exploiting heterogeneity in policy analysis. The paper provides an overview of a set of six papers contained in a special edition which define and address this gap in analytical approaches and identify aspects of the way forward. Evidence is presented of inconsistencies and practicalities which emphasise the gap, but all papers present evidence of integrative progress and list opportunities for accelerating it. Constraints on the subject matter are outlined and a challenge to livestock policy analysts is made. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although they are both implementations of the same EU regulatory framework, these systems differ in many respects. Case study data from control bodies on non-compliance and sanctions are presented and analysed using binary choice models. This analysis shows that the occurrence of slight non-compliance and greater farm acreage are significant risk factors that explain severe non-compliance in both countries. However, to implement an efficient risk-based inspection system in the future, the data collection process must be improved and extended to examine personal attributes of farmers and operators.
